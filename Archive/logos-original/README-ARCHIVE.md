# Logos Original Documentation Archive

This directory contains the original Logos documentation files that have been integrated into the ProofChecker documentation ecosystem.

## Integration Status

The Logos documentation has been integrated into `/Documentation/` as follows:

### Philosophical Foundations
- Original: `Logos/README.md` (partial content)
- Integrated to: `/Documentation/UserGuide/LOGOS_PHILOSOPHY.md`
- Purpose: High-level philosophical overview and layer architecture

### Research Vision Documents
- Original: `Logos/RL_TRAINING.md`
- Integrated to: `/Documentation/Research/DUAL_VERIFICATION.md`
- Purpose: RL training architecture using dual verification

- Original: `Logos/PROOF_LIBRARY.md`
- Integrated to: `/Documentation/Research/PROOF_LIBRARY_DESIGN.md`
- Purpose: Theorem caching and pattern matching design

- Original: `Logos/LOGOS_LAYERS.md`
- Integrated to: `/Documentation/Research/LAYER_EXTENSIONS.md`
- Purpose: Layers 1-3 operator extension specifications

### Status Centralization

All implementation status information has been centralized to:
`/Documentation/ProjectInfo/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md`

Original status claims in Logos documents have been replaced with links to IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md to maintain single source of truth and reduce maintenance burden.
