# README Standard for FormalSystem/

This document defines the template and required sections for all README files in the
`FormalSystem/` directory tree.

**Last verified: 2026-05-29**

> **Note**: READMEs drift from the tree they describe. Rather than planting reminders in
> every file, verify inventories mechanically:
> `bash scripts/check-module-invariants.sh` fails on any module path in markdown that does
> not resolve to a real module, and prints the live per-directory file counts.

## Required Sections

Every README in a Lean-containing directory MUST include:

1. **Title** — Single `# Title` heading matching the directory name
2. **Scope description** — 1-3 sentences describing what this directory contains and its role in the overall library
3. **Module inventory table** — Table listing every `.lean` file and subdirectory:
   - Columns: File/Directory | Lines | Description
   - Generated: wrap the table in `<!-- BEGIN GENERATED: inventory dir=<path> -->` /
     `<!-- END GENERATED -->` and run `bash scripts/check-module-invariants.sh --emit-inventory`
4. **Key definitions and results** — Bullet list of the most important definitions, theorems, and types
5. **Cross-links** — Navigation footer (see template below)
6. **Last verified date** — `*Last verified: YYYY-MM-DD*` at the bottom

---

## Optional Sections

Include these sections as appropriate:

- **Sorry status** — If files contain sorry, document count and impact
- **Architecture notes** — Dependency diagrams or flowcharts for complex directories
- **Verification commands** — Shell commands to verify documented claims
- **Design notes** — Implementation decisions worth preserving

---

## README Template

```markdown
# DirectoryName

One-sentence summary of purpose.

Optional: 1-2 additional sentences on context or significance.

## Modules

| File | Lines | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `Foo.lean` | NNN | Brief description |
| `Bar.lean` | NNN | Brief description |
| `Baz/` | — | Subdirectory: brief description |

## Key Definitions

- `TypeName`: What it represents
- `functionName`: What it computes
- `theoremName`: What it proves

## Dependencies

- **Imports from**: `ParentDir/Foo.lean`, `SiblingDir/`
- **Imported by**: `DependentDir/`

## Related Documentation

- [Parent README](../README.md)
- [Sibling README](../Sibling/README.md)
- [Child README](Child/README.md)

*Last verified: YYYY-MM-DD*
```

## Module Inventory Table

The inventory table must be exhaustive: every `.lean` file and every subdirectory
that contains `.lean` files must appear as a row.

**Generating the table**: wrap the table in the generated-block markers

```markdown
<!-- BEGIN GENERATED: inventory dir=FormalSystem/Automation -->
| File | Lines | Description |
|------|------:|-------------|
<!-- END GENERATED -->
```

and run `bash scripts/check-module-invariants.sh --emit-inventory`. Every column
except the trailing Description is machine-owned; the Description is hand-written
and is carried across regeneration by file name. A file that has just appeared
gets `<!-- TODO: add description -->`; a row whose file no longer exists is
dropped. The marker accepts `rows=`, `filter=`, `cols=`, `desc=`, `link=` and
`sort=` options — see the `--emit-inventory` header comment in
`scripts/check-module-invariants.sh`.

**Line counts**: never typed by hand. The INV check in
`scripts/check-module-invariants.sh` fails if any generated block has drifted
from the tree, so a stale count is caught at the gate rather than read by a
paper reader.

**Subdirectory entries**: Use `DirName/` (trailing slash) in the File column.
Use `—` in the Lines column. Describe the subdirectory's purpose in one phrase.

---

## Cross-Link Requirements

Every README must link to:
- Its **parent directory** README (except the root `FormalSystem/README.md`)
- Any **child directory** READMEs (for directories with subdirectories)
- Closely **related sibling** READMEs (as applicable)

**Bidirectional linking**: If README A links to README B, README B must link to README A.

---

## Verification Date

Every README must end with a "Last verified" date:

```markdown
*Last verified: YYYY-MM-DD*
```

Update this date whenever you verify the README matches the current directory contents.

Do **not** plant reminder notes referring to pending work. Task numbers are renumbered by
archival operations and mean nothing to a later reader, and a reminder in 26 files is 26
files to clean up rather than one check to run. Verify against the tree instead:

```bash
bash scripts/check-module-invariants.sh --no-build   # C5 catches dangling module paths
```

---

## File Naming Convention

All `.md` files in `docs/` must use **lowercase kebab-case**.

### Rule

New documentation files must be named in lowercase kebab-case:
- Words separated by hyphens, all lowercase
- Examples: `axiom-reference.md`, `implementation-status.md`, `proof-patterns.md`, `tactic-development.md`

### Exception

`README.md` is excluded from this rule. The uppercase `README.md` filename is a universal
convention recognized by Git forges (GitHub, GitLab) and documentation tools.

### Rationale

Lowercase kebab-case is the repository-wide convention for documentation files. It avoids
case-sensitivity issues across operating systems and provides consistent, readable filenames.

### Migration Reference

The following files were renamed from SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE to kebab-case when this
convention was adopted:

| Old Name | New Name |
|----------|----------|
| `AXIOM_REFERENCE.md` | `axiom-reference.md` |
| `OPERATORS.md` | `operators.md` |
| `TACTIC_REFERENCE.md` | `tactic-reference.md` |
| `ARCHITECTURE.md` | `architecture.md` |
| `EXAMPLES.md` | `examples.md` |
| `PROOF_PATTERNS.md` | `proof-patterns.md` |
| `QUICKSTART.md` | `quickstart.md` |
| `TACTIC_DEVELOPMENT.md` | `tactic-development.md` |
| `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` | `troubleshooting.md` |
| `TUTORIAL.md` | `tutorial.md` |
| `IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` | `implementation-status.md` |
| `KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md` | `known-limitations.md` |
| `PERFORMANCE_TARGETS.md` | `performance-targets.md` |
| `TACTIC_REGISTRY.md` | `tactic-registry.md` |
| `TEST_COVERAGE.md` | `test-coverage.md` |

---

## Lint Compliance

A README passes the lint check (`scripts/readme-lint.sh`) when:

1. All `.lean` files in the directory appear in the module inventory table
2. All subdirectories containing `.lean` files appear in the table
3. No broken relative links (file references that do not exist on disk)
4. "Last verified" date is present
5. Required sections (title, scope, inventory, cross-links) are present
