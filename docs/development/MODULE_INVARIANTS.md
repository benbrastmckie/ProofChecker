# Module Invariants Check

`scripts/check-module-invariants.sh` answers one question mechanically: **did a change
to the module structure break anything?** It exists so that "nothing broke" is a command
with an exit code rather than a judgement call.

```bash
bash scripts/check-module-invariants.sh              # everything (builds; ~1-2 min warm)
bash scripts/check-module-invariants.sh --no-build   # structural checks only (seconds)
```

Exit 0 means every check passed. Any failure names the specific check and the offending
file and line.

## What It Checks

| ID | Check | Why it exists |
|----|-------|---------------|
| B0 | The archive is a single directory, found and excluded | Every traversal filters on the `*/Boneyard/*` name glob. When the archive was split across two directories a filter naming only the top-level one counted 29k archived lines as live; asserting the count is exactly 1 turns a second archive reappearing into a gate failure rather than a silent miscount |
| C1 | `lake build` and `lake build BimodalTest` exit 0 | Baseline correctness |
| C2 | `#print axioms` for four flagship theorems matches a recorded baseline | Detects a proof silently rerouted through different dependencies — invisible to a green build and an unchanged sorry count |
| C3 | Exactly one structural `sorry`, located **by content** | Asserting a line number breaks on any edit above it; the check finds the enclosing declaration instead |
| C4 | Every `import FormalSystem.*` / `import BimodalTest.*` resolves | Catches a half-finished file move |
| C5 | Every module-shaped `Bimodal.*` path in non-`specs/` markdown resolves | A `.lean`-only rewrite leaves documentation dangling |
| C6 | Known-unreachable live modules still compile | Code outside the build graph cannot rot unseen |
| C7 | Live inventory (informational, never asserted) | The correct source for any file count |
| C8 | Every Lean-bearing subdirectory has exactly one sibling aggregator `X.lean` beside `X/` | One convention, checkable |
| C9 | Zero task-number citations under `FormalSystem/` | Task numbers are renumbered by archival and mean nothing to a later reader |
| C10 | Zero references to the pre-relocation `FormalSystem/{docs,latex,typst}` paths | `docs/`, `latex/` and `typst/` live at the project root |
| C11 | Every `import` inside `FormalSystem/Boneyard/` resolves, or is waived | The archive is never compiled, so `lake build` cannot see its imports rot. 65 archived import lines were already dangling when the two archives were consolidated |
| C12 | Every **slash-shaped** source path in `docs/` + `README.md` resolves | C5 matches only *dotted* module names, so the slash form of `FormalSystem/Metalogic/Bundle/BFMCS.lean` is invisible to it. A table naming six source files, four of which did not exist, survived a green gate on exactly this blind spot |
| C13 | Every relative markdown link in `docs/` + `README.md` resolves | Nothing checked `docs/` links at all; 96 of them had rotted, several pointing outside the repository |
| C14 | Documented axiom and sorry counts match the tree — in `docs/`, `README.md` **and** `FormalSystem/**/*.lean` docstrings — and the two headline theorems C2 does not cover match their axiom baseline | C2 and C3 assert facts about the *tree*; C14 is what asserts the *documentation* agrees with them. `docs/` had documented the axiom count as 21 against an actual 45, and the sorry count as 12 against an actual 0. The `.lean` half was added later: C14's original markdown-only scope is exactly why six docstrings claiming an axiom-constructor count of 42 survived a 42 → 45 change untouched, and widening it immediately surfaced seven further claims of an axiom count of 21, in Lean docstrings that no gate had ever seen |
| C15 | Every `def:`/`thm:`/`lem:`/`cor:`/`app:`/`rmk:` paper-anchor citation in live scope resolves against `specs/paper-definitions-of-record.md` | Nothing asserted that a cited paper anchor exists. Thirty dangling citations accumulated across six paper editing waves; `lem:fibers` alone was cited 17 times after the paper deleted its `\label` |
| C24 | Every module in the `FormalSystem` root closure transitively imports `FormalSystem.Init`, via `lake exe checkInitImports` | `FormalSystem/Init.lean` exists so that repository-wide linter options and common tactic imports have one place to be inherited from, and that promise is only as strong as its weakest module: a file with no path to the root silently opts out of every option the root sets, and a green build says nothing about it. The check reads the real import graph out of the compiled environment rather than the text of the `import` lines, so it sees inheritance through intermediate modules exactly as Lean does — which is why the invariant is carried by eleven import lines at the minimal elements of the internal DAG, not one per module. It ran reporting-only for one release cycle, over 457 modules with no path to the root |
| C25 | Every `lean_exe` root declared in `lakefile.lean` compiles, with the root list scraped at run time | `lake build` elaborates only what is reachable from the two library targets, so every `lean_exe` root sits outside both closures: nothing imports it, C24's closure walk never reaches it, and C6 cannot cover it either — C6 seeds its own reachability walk from these same `root :=` lines, so an exe root is *reachable* by C6's definition and a manifest line for one trips C6's stale-manifest branch rather than covering it. The gap was not hypothetical: `FormalSystem/Automation/ProofStepExport.lean`, the `proof_extractor` root, failed to elaborate for an extended period with three `Application type mismatch` errors masking a further 873, `lake exe proof_extractor` was simply broken, and the tree was green throughout because no gate anywhere could observe it. Scraping the list from `lakefile.lean` rather than maintaining one means a newly declared executable is covered the day it is added. Module targets only, never exe targets — elaboration coverage without linking a 240-310 MB binary per root, thirteen times over |
| C9D | Task-number citations under `docs/` (computed always, **soft** by default) | C9's rule binds `docs/` too, but `docs/` does not yet satisfy it. Reported at every gate so the debt is visible rather than forgotten |

### Why C5 was not simply extended

C12 is a separate check rather than a widening of C5's regex, and this is deliberate.
Extending C5 to also match `Bimodal.*` would immediately turn the gate red on occurrences in
`FormalSystem/**/README.md` that are a separate piece of work. C12 covers the *slash* form over
a *different scope*, so it can be enforced today without holding the gate hostage to unrelated
files. Do not merge the two.

C12's pattern includes `Logos/` and `Bimodal/` — the two pre-merge tree roots. Neither resolves
to anything in the current tree, so any occurrence is a defect by construction, which is the
point of naming them.

## The Companion Files

### `scripts/module-invariants-manifest.txt` — known-unreachable modules (C6)

`lake build` only compiles what is reachable from a Lake target root. A module that no
target imports is never compiled, so a broken import inside it goes unnoticed
indefinitely. Every such module must be listed here; C6 compile-checks each one with
`lake build <Module>`.

- C6 **fails** if an unreachable live module is missing from the file.
- C6 **fails** if an entry names a module that no longer exists.
- C6 **fails** if an entry names a module that is now *reachable* — `lake build` already
  guards it, so the line is stale and must be deleted.
- A `broken:` prefix marks a module known not to compile. It is still tracked, so it
  cannot be forgotten, but is not compile-checked. Removing the prefix is how a repaired
  module re-enters the gate.

Wiring a module into the build graph means **deleting** its line here.

### `scripts/module-invariants-allowlist.txt` — non-module dotted names (C5)

C5 cannot distinguish a module path from a fully-qualified namespace or declaration
name: both are dotted and capitalized. Names verified to be real namespaces or
declarations are listed here with the file and line that defines them.

This is a permanent, documented exemption — **not** a place to park a genuinely stale
module path. Add an entry only after confirming with `grep -rn` that the name is live.
C5 reports allowlist entries that no longer occur, so stale exemptions get pruned.

### `scripts/boneyard-import-waivers.txt` — unrepairable archived imports (C11)

An archived file is outside the import closure, so nothing compiles it and nothing
notices when a module it imports is deleted or moved. C11 closes that hole: every
`import FormalSystem.*` / `import BimodalTest.*` line under `FormalSystem/Boneyard/`
must resolve to a file on disk, or appear here.

Entries are permanent records of imports that **cannot** be repaired — the target was
deleted outright, or its name is genuinely ambiguous and choosing a target would
fabricate provenance. Each carries the reason, and a deletion carries the commit that
did it.

This is not a backlog. Before adding an entry, prove there is no unique target file on
disk; if there is one, fix the import instead. C11 reports entries that no longer occur
as stale, on the C5 model, so the file cannot become a dumping ground.

### `specs/paper-definitions-of-record.md` — the paper-anchor resolution source (C15)

C15 resolves every paper-anchor citation against this file, **never against the paper**. That is
deliberate. The paper (`possible_worlds.tex`) lives in a different repository this one cannot see
from CI, and it is edited by its author on his own schedule — it moved through six definitional
waves in ten days, twice while a dispatch against it was in flight. A check that resolved against
the live `.tex` would go red whenever the author edited his own paper, an event this repository
neither controls nor can fix by editing itself. Resolving against the pinned record makes C15
assert something this repository *can* act on: that every anchor it cites is a recorded decision.

A citation resolves if it has **either** a row in the record's `MANIFEST` block (a pinned anchor,
whose verbatim text and hash are tracked) **or** a row in the record's `KNOWN-ANCHORS` block, with
one of two statuses:

- `LIVE-UNPINNED` — resolves to a live `\label{}` in the paper, but the tree cites it by name
  only, so pinning its text would buy nothing. Promote it to the manifest if a docstring starts
  quoting it verbatim.
- `DANGLING` — does **not** resolve: retired, commented out, or never a paper label at all. Every
  citation site for one of these must say so in its own prose; C15 asserts only that the anchor is
  *recorded*, not that the surrounding sentence is honest.

An anchor with no row in either block is a typo or an undocumented citation. Both are defects, and
the fix is to correct the citation or record the anchor — not to widen the check's exclusions.

### `scripts/markdown-link-allowlist.txt` — link-syntax illustrations (C13)

Markdown **files** (not individual links) whose relative links are not resolution-checked. Only
two justifications are admissible, and both are about links that illustrate link *syntax*
rather than links a reader is meant to follow: template snippets showing what a directory
README should look like, and grep patterns inside a fenced code block that happen to parse as
markdown links. Three files qualify today.

"This link is broken and I do not want to fix it" is not an admissible reason. Fix the link, or
delete it and keep the prose.

`scripts/readme-lint.sh` reads the same file, so the two checks cannot disagree about what
counts as an illustration.

### `scripts/markdown-slash-path-allowlist.txt` — hypothetical source paths (C12)

Slash-shaped paths permitted not to resolve. The bar is a path that is deliberately
hypothetical — a "create this file" instruction in a guide. Prefer naming the containing
directory instead, which resolves and needs no entry at all; that is why this file is currently
**empty**.

Both allowlists report entries that no longer match anything as an `INFO` line, so neither can
silently rot.

C11 ships enforced, with no `ENFORCE_C11` flag: unlike C8/C9/C10 below, the invariant was
already true at the moment the check landed, so there was never a red phase to gate.

## Adding a Check

Checks C8, C9, C10 and C9D describe end-state invariants that a tree in mid-reorganization
does not yet satisfy. Each is computed and reported from the outset but gated behind an
`ENFORCE_C<n>` variable near the top of the script; while the flag is 0 the check prints
a `TODO` line and does not affect the exit code. This makes progress visible without a
permanently-red gate.

`ENFORCE_C9_DOCS` is the live example. It defaults to **0**, and the check reports a
three-figure citation count at every gate, two thirds of it in a single historical file
(`PHASED_IMPLEMENTATION.md`). Verify it is a real computation rather than a stub with:

```bash
ENFORCE_C9_DOCS=1 bash scripts/check-module-invariants.sh --no-build   # exits 1, with a count
```

Flip the default to 1 once those citations are cleared.

C12, C13, C14 and C15 ship **enforced**, with no flags, because the work that cleared their debt
landed in the same change that added them. C14 has two halves: a content scan that always runs,
and a `#print axioms` half that skips cleanly under `--no-build` exactly as C2 does.

C24 ships enforced for the same reason, and was accepted only after the same **deliberate
negative test** C15 was: the `import FormalSystem.Init` line was removed from one low-fan-out
leaf, `FAIL C24` and a non-zero script exit were observed, and the line was restored and the
`PASS` re-observed. Re-run that test after any change to C24's scope or to
`scripts/CheckInitImports.lean`'s exit path — the executable originally returned
`diff.length.toUInt32`, and an 8-bit exit status truncates that, so it would have printed a
failure while handing the shell a `0` at any count that happened to be a multiple of 256.

C25 ships enforced on the same precedent and was accepted only after the same negative test, run
deliberately on a module *other* than the one the same change repaired: a one-character break was
introduced in `FormalSystem/Automation/TraceExporter.lean` — not `ProofStepExport.lean`, since a
failure in the module under repair would prove nothing about the gate — `FAIL C25` was observed
**together with a non-zero script exit**, and the file was restored and the `PASS` and exit 0
re-observed. Re-run that test after any change to C25's scope or to its root-scraping regex, and
check the shell's exit status as well as the printed line: C24's history above is exactly a case of
a check that could print a failure while handing the shell a `0`.

C15 was accepted only after a **deliberate negative test** — a scratch file citing a `thm:` anchor that
appears nowhere in the record was added under `docs/`, the gate was confirmed to fail with
`FAIL C15`, the file was removed, and the gate was confirmed to pass again. A check that
silently passes on everything is worse than no check, so run that test again after any change
to C15's scope or resolution source.

**Never flip an `ENFORCE_` flag back to 0 to make a gate pass.** Preventing exactly that
is why the flags are named and defaulted in the script rather than passed on the command
line.

## When to Run It

- After any file move, rename, or import change
- Before committing a change to the module structure
- Whenever you need a live file count — use C7's output rather than an ad-hoc `find`,
  which will get the Boneyard exclusion wrong

## Sibling scripts, not part of this harness

`scripts/check-metalogic-cycles.sh` is a standalone structural check with its own exit code,
deliberately not wired into `check-module-invariants.sh`. It enumerates the directory-level import
edges inside `FormalSystem/Metalogic/` — excluding sibling aggregators as edge *sources*, since an
aggregator importing its own directory is a convention artifact rather than a design cycle — and
asserts the cycle count is exactly **1**, the documented `BXCanonical` <-> `WeakCanonical` pair:

```bash
bash scripts/check-metalogic-cycles.sh   # prints every edge in the cycle; exit 1 on any other count
```

It exists because that count used to be prose in
[`FormalSystem/Metalogic/README.md`](../../FormalSystem/Metalogic/README.md), re-derived by hand
whenever someone needed to trust it, and it went stale. Zero cycles is a failure too, not a pass:
the pair is expected to be present, so its disappearance is a finding.

## A note on this file

C12, C14 and C15 scan `docs/`, and this file is in `docs/`. Prose here that names a hypothetical
source path, or quotes a stale count in the shape the tripwire matches, will fail the very
checks it documents. That is the checks working, not a false positive: all three were caught on
this page while it was being written. Cite a path that resolves, phrase a historical count so it
does not read as a current claim, and **do not write a literal unresolvable anchor** — describing
C15's negative test cost exactly one `FAIL C15` on this page before the sentence was reworded to
name the anchor's shape rather than spell one out.
