This document characterizes the proof library architecture enabling computational scaling through theorem caching, pattern matching, and fast inference lookup. The library provides instant positive RL signals from cached proofs, reduces computational overhead through theorem reuse, and supports incremental learning from simple to complex reasoning patterns.

## Introduction to Computational Scaling

Traditional theorem proving faces a fundamental scaling challenge: every inference requires constructing a complete proof from axioms, even when similar inferences have been verified previously. This creates computational bottlenecks as systems repeatedly prove structurally identical theorems with different instantiations.

**The Proof Library Solution**: Cache verified theorems with metadata enabling fast pattern matching and automatic application. When a new inference matches a cached pattern, the system retrieves the stored proof rather than reconstructing it, providing instant verification and positive RL signals.

**Key Benefit**: Computational scaling rather than human labor. As the library grows through successful proof construction, the system becomes more efficient, learning to recognize and reuse proven patterns systematically.

**RL Training Integration**: Proof libraries provide immediate positive reinforcement signals for cached theorems, enabling efficient training without repeated verification overhead. The library grows continuously through training, creating a virtuous cycle of improved efficiency.

## Library Architecture

The proof library implements a **theorem registry** with searchable database, pattern matching for theorem lookup, dependency tracking across proven theorems, and automatic theorem application where patterns match.

### Theorem Registry Structure

**TheoremEntry Components**:

```lean
structure TheoremEntry :=
  (name : String)                          -- Unique identifier
  (statement : Context × Formula)          -- Premises and conclusion
  (proof : Derivable statement.1 statement.2)  -- Verified proof object
  (tags : List String)                     -- Searchable metadata
  (dependencies : List String)             -- Required theorems
```

**Global Registry**:

The theorem registry maintains a global collection of all verified theorems loaded from persistent storage (file or database). Theorems persist across sessions, enabling continuous accumulation of verified knowledge.

**Example TheoremEntry**:

```lean
TheoremEntry.mk
  "modal_t_p"                              -- Name
  ([], □p → p)                             -- Empty context, conclusion
  (proof_object)                           -- LEAN proof receipt
  ["modal", "S5", "reflexivity"]          -- Tags
  []                                       -- No dependencies (axiom)
```

This entry represents the modal T axiom instantiated with atomic proposition p, verified through LEAN proof construction, tagged for searchability, with no dependencies (derived directly from axiom schema).

### Pattern Matching

**Pattern Structure**:

Theorems stored with schematic variables enabling matching against concrete formulas.

**Example Pattern**:

```lean
pattern: □φ → φ                            -- Schema with variable φ
matches: □p → p                            -- Instantiation with p
matches: □(p ∧ q) → (p ∧ q)                -- Instantiation with p ∧ q
matches: □(□r → r) → (□r → r)              -- Instantiation with □r → r
```

Any formula can be substituted for φ in the pattern, generating infinite matching instances.

**Matching Algorithm**:

1. Parse candidate inference into syntactic structure
2. Compare against theorem patterns in registry
3. Attempt unification: find substitution mapping pattern variables to concrete formulas
4. If unification succeeds: Instantiate cached proof with substitution
5. If unification fails: Try next pattern or construct new proof

**Efficiency**: Pattern matching operates in time proportional to theorem count (linear scan) or logarithmic time with indexed data structures.

### Dependency Tracking

**Dependency Graph**:

The library maintains dependency relationships between theorems, tracking which theorems rely on which others.

**Example Dependencies**:

```
Perpetuity Principle P3: □φ → □△φ
  depends on: Perpetuity Principle P1 (□φ → △φ)
  depends on: Modal axiom MF (□φ → □Fφ)
  depends on: Temporal transitivity

Modal T instance: □p → p
  depends on: Modal T axiom schema
  no other dependencies (direct instantiation)
```

**Uses**:

- **Proof Reconstruction**: If theorem removed, identify dependent theorems needing reverification
- **Library Compression**: Remove redundant theorems derivable from others
- **Learning Pathways**: Identify prerequisite theorems for complex proofs
- **Curriculum Generation**: Order theorems by dependency depth (simple to complex)

### Automatic Theorem Application

**Application Workflow**:

When new inference submitted:

1. **Pattern Match**: Search registry for matching theorems
2. **Unification**: Compute substitution for pattern variables
3. **Instantiation**: Apply substitution to cached proof
4. **Verification**: LEAN type-checks instantiated proof (fast)
5. **Return**: Proof receipt if verification succeeds

**Example**:

Candidate inference: `□(p ∧ q) → (p ∧ q)`

1. Matches pattern: `□φ → φ` with substitution `φ := (p ∧ q)`
2. Retrieve cached proof for modal T axiom
3. Instantiate proof with `φ := (p ∧ q)`
4. LEAN verifies instantiation (milliseconds)
5. Return proof receipt (positive RL signal)

**Performance**: Proof instantiation and verification dramatically faster than proof construction from axioms (10-100x speedup typical).

## Benefits for RL Training

The proof library provides multiple benefits for reinforcement learning training efficiency and effectiveness.

### Instant Positive Signals

**Cached Proof Lookup**: When candidate inference matches library pattern, proof receipt returned instantly without proof search.

**Training Speedup**: RL training requires many inference attempts per learning iteration. Library enables 10-100x speedup for cached theorems, dramatically accelerating training.

**Projected Throughput** (not measured):

- **Without Library**: 10-20 inferences/second (proof construction overhead)
- **With Library**: 100-1000 inferences/second for cached theorems
- **Training Acceleration**: 10-50x faster convergence for learned patterns

**Immediate Reinforcement**: Instant proof receipts provide immediate positive RL signals, strengthening correct reasoning patterns efficiently.

### Reduced Computational Overhead

**Proof Search Elimination**: Cached theorems avoid expensive proof search, reducing computational cost per inference.

**Resource Efficiency**:

- **Memory**: Library storage (megabytes) much smaller than repeated proof construction overhead
- **CPU**: Pattern matching (microseconds) much faster than proof search (milliseconds-seconds)
- **Energy**: Dramatically reduced power consumption for training at scale

**Scaling Properties**: As library grows, average inference time decreases (more cache hits), creating positive feedback loop.

### Incremental Learning

**Progressive Difficulty**: Library naturally enables curriculum learning from simple to complex:

1. **Simple Axiom Instances**: Cached immediately, instant retrieval
2. **One-Step Derivations**: Cached after first construction, fast retrieval
3. **Multi-Step Proofs**: Cached after construction, medium retrieval
4. **Complex Theorems**: Built from cached components, composed retrieval

**Learning Pathway**: AI systems master simple patterns first (high cache hit rate), gradually tackling complex patterns (lower cache hit rate initially), building library progressively.

**Example Progression** (projected):

- **Week 1**: Cache 100 simple axiom instances, 90% cache hit rate
- **Week 2**: Cache 500 one-step derivations, 85% cache hit rate
- **Week 3**: Cache 200 multi-step proofs, 75% cache hit rate
- **Week 4**: Cache 50 complex theorems, 60% cache hit rate

Cache hit rate drives training efficiency: high hit rate enables fast iteration, building foundations for tackling harder problems.

### Library Growth Through Training

**Continuous Accumulation**: Every successful proof construction adds theorem to library (if novel).

**Knowledge Compounding**: Library grows continuously, improving efficiency over time.

**Training Virtuous Cycle**:

```
More Training → More Proofs Constructed → Larger Library
      ↑                                         ↓
Faster Training ← Higher Cache Hit Rate ← More Cached Theorems
```

This positive feedback enables exponential efficiency gains: initial training slow (small library), later training fast (large library).

## Integration with Proof-Checker

The proof library integrates directly with LEAN proof-checker workflow, providing seamless caching and retrieval.

### Workflow Integration

**Proof Construction → Library Addition → Fast Retrieval → Reuse**

**Stage 1: Proof Construction**

When new inference submitted:
1. Check library for matching pattern
2. If match found: Return cached proof (instant)
3. If no match: Construct proof from axioms (slow)
4. Verify proof with LEAN (generates receipt)

**Stage 2: Library Addition**

After successful proof construction:
1. Extract pattern from proven theorem
2. Create TheoremEntry with metadata
3. Add to registry with tags
4. Update dependency graph
5. Persist to storage

**Stage 3: Fast Retrieval**

For subsequent matching inferences:
1. Pattern match identifies cached theorem
2. Compute substitution for variables
3. Instantiate cached proof
4. LEAN verifies instantiation (fast)
5. Return proof receipt

**Stage 4: Reuse**

Cached theorems serve multiple purposes:
- Direct inference verification (RL positive signals)
- Building blocks for complex proofs (proof composition)
- Curriculum generation (learning pathway planning)
- Performance analytics (tracking progress)

### Proof Checker API Integration

**Library Lookup Function**:

```lean
def try_library_lookup (Γ : Context) (φ : Formula) :
  IO (Option (Γ ⊢ φ)) := by
  -- Search registry for matching pattern
  -- Compute unification if pattern found
  -- Instantiate and verify cached proof
  -- Return proof object if successful
  sorry
```

**Automatic Application**:

```lean
def prove_with_library (Γ : Context) (φ : Formula) :
  IO (Γ ⊢ φ) := by
  -- Try library lookup first
  match try_library_lookup Γ φ with
  | some proof => return proof        -- Cache hit
  | none =>                           -- Cache miss
      let proof ← construct_proof Γ φ  -- Build from axioms
      add_to_library proof             -- Cache for future
      return proof
```

This workflow transparently integrates library lookup with proof construction, optimizing for cache hits while falling back to construction when needed.

### Efficient Reasoning Through Retrieval + Verification

**Two-Stage Process**:

1. **Retrieval**: Pattern match cached theorems (microseconds)
2. **Verification**: LEAN type-checks instantiation (milliseconds)

**Contrast with Pure Construction**: Proof search from axioms requires exploring derivation space, potentially exponential time.

**Projected Performance Comparison** (not measured):

| Operation | Time (typical) | Scaling |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| Pattern matching | 1-10 μs | Linear in library size |
| Proof instantiation | 1-10 ms | Constant |
| LEAN verification | 10-100 ms | Linear in proof size |
| **Total retrieval** | **10-110 ms** | **Sub-linear** |
| Proof construction | 100-5000 ms | Exponential in complexity |

Retrieval + verification provides 10-100x speedup for cached theorems.

## Common Theorem Patterns

The library accumulates frequently-used theorem patterns enabling efficient reuse.

### Modal Axiom Instances

**Pattern**: `□φ → φ` (modal T axiom)

**Instances**:
- `□p → p` (atomic proposition)
- `□(p ∧ q) → (p ∧ q)` (conjunction)
- `□(p → q) → (p → q)` (implication)
- `□□p → □p` (nested necessity)

**Usage**: Fundamental modal reasoning, used in thousands of proofs.

**Cache Benefit**: Instant retrieval for any instantiation, no proof reconstruction.

### Perpetuity Principles

**Pattern P1**: `□φ → △φ` (necessity implies always)

**Pattern P3**: `□φ → □△φ` (necessity of perpetuity)

**Instances**:
- `□p → △p` (atomic)
- `□(p ∧ q) → △(p ∧ q)` (conjunction)
- `□Fp → △Fp` (future temporal)

**Usage**: Connecting modal and temporal operators, essential for bimodal reasoning.

**Cache Benefit**: Complex multi-step proofs cached as single-step lookups.

### Temporal Transitivity

**Pattern**: `Fφ → FFφ` (temporal T4 axiom)

**Instances**:
- `Fp → FFp` (atomic)
- `F(p ∧ q) → FF(p ∧ q)` (conjunction)
- `FGp → FFGp` (always future)

**Usage**: Temporal reasoning chains, planning across multiple time steps.

**Cache Benefit**: Temporal derivations accelerated through cached transitivity.

### Composed Patterns

**Pattern**: `(□φ ∧ □ψ) → □(φ ∧ ψ)` (necessity distributes over conjunction)

**Derivation**: Requires modus ponens, modal K, conjunction introduction.

**Cache Storage**: Complex derivation cached as single retrievable theorem.

**Usage**: Modal logic inference in countless contexts.

**Cache Benefit**: Multi-step derivation reduced to instant retrieval.

## Performance Characteristics

The proof library exhibits favorable scaling properties supporting efficient training.

### Projected Performance (Not Measured)

**Note**: These are projected, not measured.

**Lookup Speed vs Construction Time**:

**Lookup Performance**:

- **Best Case** (exact match): 1-10 microseconds
- **Average Case** (pattern match): 10-100 microseconds
- **Worst Case** (no match): Linear in library size (still microseconds for reasonable sizes)

**Construction Performance**:

- **Best Case** (simple axiom): 100 milliseconds
- **Average Case** (multi-step proof): 500-2000 milliseconds
- **Worst Case** (complex theorem): 5-60 seconds

**Speedup Factor**: 1000-10000x for cached theorems.

### Scaling Properties as Library Grows

**Library Size Growth**: Linear in number of unique theorems proven.

**Lookup Time Growth**: Logarithmic with indexed search (B-tree, hash table).

**Cache Hit Rate Growth**: Increases with library size (more patterns covered).

**Training Time Decrease**: As library grows, average inference time decreases.

### Memory Requirements

**Theorem Storage**:

- **Proof Object**: 1-10 KB per theorem (LEAN internal representation)
- **Metadata**: 100-500 bytes per theorem (tags, dependencies)
- **Pattern Index**: 100-1000 bytes per theorem (search acceleration)

**Total**: ~2-20 KB per theorem

**Scaling**:

- 1,000 theorems: 2-20 MB
- 10,000 theorems: 20-200 MB
- 100,000 theorems: 200 MB - 2 GB
- 1,000,000 theorems: 2-20 GB

**Conclusion**: Memory requirements modest even for very large libraries (millions of theorems fit in RAM).
