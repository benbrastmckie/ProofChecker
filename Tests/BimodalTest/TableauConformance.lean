# Tableau Conformance Corpus

An executable regression corpus for the tableau calculus in
`FormalSystem/Metalogic/Decidability/`. Every row records the verdict the engine
*currently* produces alongside the verdict semantics *requires*; rows where the two
disagree are marked `[DEFECT]` and are the corpus's record of the outstanding
calculus defects.

## Why a corpus and not a `lake build` check

A sorry-free green build is not adequacy evidence for a tableau calculus: a calculus can
be perfectly well-typed, terminate, and still answer OPEN on a valid formula. The only
evidence that the *rules* are adequate is executable: run the engine on formulas whose
semantic status is settled and compare.

## Which validity notion each class targets

The engine is parameterised by `FrameClass`. Each class's corpus is scored against a
different semantic target (`FormalSystem/Semantics/Validity.lean`):

| `FrameClass` | Semantic target | Carrier the bridge will use |
|---|---|---|
| `.Base` | `⊨ φ` (`Valid`, all linear TM frames) | ℚ |
| `.Dense` | `ValidDense φ` | ℚ |
| `.ZTime` | `ValidZTime φ` | ℤ |
| `.RTime` | `ValidRTime φ` (dense *and* conditionally complete) | ℝ |

Consequently the same formula can legitimately carry different targets in different
tables: `F p → F F p` is invalid over an arbitrary linear order and over ℤ, but valid
over any dense order, so it targets OPEN at `.Base`/`.ZTime` and CLOSED at
`.Dense`/`.RTime`.

## Verdict vocabulary

`verdict` reduces `buildTableau` to a `String`, deliberately:

- `CLOSED` — `buildTableau` returned `.allClosed`; the engine claims validity.
- `OPEN` — `buildTableau` returned `.hasOpen`; the engine claims a countermodel.
- `STALLED` — `buildTableau` returned `none`: fuel exhausted, or the post-blocking pass
  left the branch unsaturated. At the `DecisionResult` level this is `.fuelExhausted`,
  which R7 split off from `.extractionFailed` (a closed tableau whose proof term could not
  be reconstructed); the tableau-level adapter never sees the latter, since it reads
  `buildTableau` before extraction is attempted.

The adapter returns a `String` rather than using `decide`/`native_decide`/`rfl` because
the tableau is fuel-driven: a kernel-level decision procedure over it either stalls on
the fuel loop or forces whnf of an enormous term. `#guard_msgs in #eval` compares the
*printed* verdict table instead, which costs one interpreter run per class.

## How to use this file

Every table is pinned with `#guard_msgs`. Any change to the calculus that moves a verdict
breaks this file's build. That is the point: the expected block must then be updated in
the same commit as the calculus change, with the flip justified. Rows currently marked
`[DEFECT]` are *expected-current-failure* rows scheduled to flip; a row losing its
`[DEFECT]` marker is progress, a row gaining one is a regression.

/-! ## Re-baseline record — the `trivialEventWitnessed` guard

The `#guard_msgs` expectations marked `RE-BASELINED (guard)` below were moved from their previous
pinned values. **Owner of every such move**: `FormalSystem/Metalogic/Decidability/Tableau.lean`'s
`def trivialEventWitnessed`, consulted as a disjunct beside `witnessPresent` in both fresh-label
guards of `findApplicableRule`. It is **not** owned by `Decidability/Saturation.lean` and **not**
by the semantics refactor. The guard stops the engine minting trivial seriality witnesses, so the
time domain stops growing without bound; the shorter time domains and the renumbered downstream
indices below are the direct consequence.

**Evidence — a three-point differential, not an inference.** Each row's value was measured at
three commits, with `#guard_msgs` output captured and compared row by row:

| Point | Commit | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| P0 | `edcecd551^` (`d49b977c0`) | guard defined but **not consulted** — pre-guard behaviour |
| P1 | `edcecd551` | guard consulted |
| P2 | current `HEAD` | today |

A row was re-baselined **only** when its pinned value equalled its P0 value — i.e. the row was
correct before the guard, so the guard is the sole cause of its present mismatch. Rows whose
pinned value already disagreed with P0 were **already stale before the guard**; those are the
separately-owned mismatches baselined 2026-07-29 against an engine-behaviour change owned outside
this refactor, and they are left pinned, unedited, and enumerated below. Re-baselining them would
absorb that separately-owned change into this attribution, which is exactly what the plan forbids.

The window `edcecd551^ .. HEAD` contains only the guard consultation plus proof-body-only edits to
three files (`CountermodelExtraction.lean`, `Verified/Bridge/TemporalSaturation.lean`,
`Verified/Termination/MintBound.lean`); those diffs add and remove no `def`, `abbrev`, `instance`,
`structure`, or `inductive` line at all, so no `#eval` here can have moved because of them. This is
corroborated directly in `TableauConformance.lean`, whose P1 and P2 values are identical on every
row.

**Re-baselined in this file** (guard-attributed): rows W2, W4 and W5 — each carrying its own
`RE-BASELINED (guard)` note with the old and new value.

**SETTLED, and three rows the guard repaired on their own**: 7 row(s) — the three C4 rows in the
conformance table, plus the four W rows W1, W3, W6, W7.

All seven were members of the ten pre-existing, separately-declined mismatches, identified at row
level for the first time by the P0 measurement above: for each, the pinned value, the pre-guard
(P0) value and the current (P2) value were three *different* values, so the row was already stale
before the guard **and** the guard moved it again. They were left pinned for as long as
re-recording them would have folded a separately-owned engine change into this refactor's
re-baseline.

The three C4 rows never needed re-recording: the guard moved them back onto their pinned values,
and they are green as recorded. They are listed below unchanged, and are **not** re-recorded.

The four W rows are now re-recorded, with the attribution stated below rather than absorbed.

**Attribution.** The four W-row moves belong to the 2026-08-10/11 engine window — the semantics
refactor together with the tableau-engine work that rewrote `Decidability/Tableau.lean` and
`Decidability/Saturation.lean` and added `Verified/Termination/MintBound.lean`. They are **not**
owned by `trivialEventWitnessed`, which is the separately-owned change the original exclusion
existed to protect: the guard's contribution to these rows is the P0 → pinned step, not the
pinned → current one. Re-recording here therefore does not absorb the guard's move into a later
attribution.

**Stability.** Every `P2 current` value recorded here on 2026-08-11 is byte-identical to what Lean
generates today (the three truncated entries match on every recorded character of their prefix).
Zero drift across that window, so this settles recorded debt against a stable measurement rather
than baselining against a moving one.

**W1 ≡ W7 — the invariant W7 exists to test, now actually satisfied.** W7 is by construction W1 at
fuel 2000, five times W1's own `linearityFuel`, and its comment states the point: *identical*, so
the flip to `total=true` is `timeLinearity` firing and not a budget artifact. The **pinned** pair
was not identical — W1 pinned nine known times, W7 pinned ten, and their constraint lists differed.
The **generated** pair is byte-identical, character for character. Current engine behaviour
satisfies the invariant the row was written to test; the recorded expectation did not. This is the
single strongest item of evidence that the seven mismatches were stale expectations rather than a
regression, and it is why re-recording is the correct settlement rather than an investigation.

**W3 grew, and that is consistent.** W3's `|knownTimes|` moves `8 → 10`, against the shrinking
trend the other rows follow. Renumbering can leave a row with more surviving times, not fewer —
which times get minted and which get identified away are both affected — and the row still reports
`total=true incomparable=[]`, which is the only property it asserts. It is not evidence against the
verdict.

Fuel used by the whole corpus.

Fixed rather than `soundFuel`, for two reasons. First, `soundFuel` caps at 100000, and a
per-row interpreter run at that bound would make this file the slowest in the test suite
for no gain — the rows that stall here stall for structural reasons (a missing rule, so
the branch can never saturate), which more fuel does not fix; the audit confirmed this by
re-running counterexample A at fuel 100000 and getting the same `none`. Second, a fixed
bound keeps the table's `STALLED` entries comparable across commits, which a
formula-dependent bound would not.

**Per-row override.** `Row.fuel` defaults to this bound; a row that genuinely needs more
states its own. `expandBranchWithFuel` splits its fuel proportionally across the branches
of a split, so `orderTrichotomy`'s three-way split divides the budget available to
everything below it, and counterexample B needs a large budget to close: `10000` at
`.Base`/`.ZTime`, and `100000` in the two dense classes, where `densityRule` interpolates
extra times before the closure is reached (measured at `.Dense`: `STALLED` at 30000 and 50000,
`CLOSED` at 70000 and 100000; the row is pinned at 100000 so `.RTime` clears it too). The
run costs well under a second per class despite the bound, because the fuel is a *step* budget
and the proportional allocator hands most sub-branches a small share of it. Raising the
*corpus-wide* bound instead was tried and rejected: several rows that answer `OPEN` today
explore for minutes at that bound, which would make this file the slowest in the suite for
no gain on any row but the one.

Reduce `buildTableau` to a printable verdict. See the module docstring.

**Relation to the `DecisionResult` vocabulary (R7).** The adapter reads `buildTableau`
directly rather than `decide`, so it sees the tableau outcome before proof-term extraction is
attempted. The three verdicts therefore line up with the post-R7 constructors as follows:
`CLOSED` is the tableau-level witness of validity — `decide` turns it into either `.valid`
(term reconstructed) or `.extractionFailed` (term not reconstructed), and the corpus
deliberately does not distinguish those, because a row's semantic target is about the
calculus, not about the proof-extraction pipeline. `OPEN` corresponds to `.invalid`.
`STALLED` corresponds to `.fuelExhausted` and is the *only* verdict here that means the
engine decided nothing — which is exactly the honesty property R7 makes statable at the
`DecisionResult` level.

/-- The five seriality/dual probes carried over from the cslib tableau survey (03 §6).
All five are valid here: `serial_future`/`serial_past` (`Axioms.lean:113,117`) are
axioms of the system, so `F⊤` and `P⊤` are theorems and the rest follow.

The engine used to answer OPEN on all five — the same failure mode the cslib survey recorded
as its headline anti-lesson: a sorry-free, build-green tableau that answers OPEN on `F⊤`. The
calculus had no rule that manufactures a successor time from nothing, so a branch containing
only `F(F⊤)` saturated with no successor ever created.

All five now read CLOSED, in all four frame classes, at `conformanceFuel = 200`. `serialityRule`
supplies the missing successor: it is keyed on the *label* rather than a formula shape, emits
`T(F ⊤)` / `T(P ⊤)` there, and self-suppresses once both are present. It is deliberately kept
out of `allRulesForFC` and scheduled *globally last* — only when `findUnexpanded` returns `none`
does the seriality stage run — which is the opposite of the Dedekind arm's **prepend**
(`Tableau.lean`, `allRulesForFC`), where appending left the rules dead. Two scheduling lessons in
opposite directions.

Making this affordable also required repairing a latent defect in the blocking predicate:
candidates came from `ancestorTimes = ord.pastOf`, so a time minted by `somePastPos` — a new
global minimum with empty `pastOf` — could never be blocked, and the past-directed serial chain
ran to fuel exhaustion (the bare atom `p` reached 266 formulas over 68 times in 88 s). See

/-- The two machine-produced counterexample branches from the adversarial probe. Both
formulas are valid over any linear order, both produced an open branch satisfied by no
linear model, and each is the direct regression target of one calculus repair.

Row A now closes: transitive `futureOf` gives `G p @ t0` its reach to `t2`, and genuine
blocking lets the branch reach a verdict at all instead of being handed back as
"blocked open". Row B now closes too: `orderTrichotomy` splits on the relative order of the
two incomparable fresh times, syntactically as the `temp_linearity` disjuncts, and the three
resulting branches close — two against a negated disjunct directly, the third through the
ordinary `someFutureNeg`/conjunction machinery, which is why a single orientation of the
pair suffices even though row B's disjuncts are a permutation drawn from both orientations.
Row B carries a raised `fuel`; see `conformanceFuel`.

**Row B at `.Dense` and `.RTime`: the regression and its repair.** Row B briefly read
`STALLED` in the two dense classes while branch-guarded non-destructive expansion was landing.
Two separate defects were involved, and the bisection that separated them is worth keeping:

1. *Not* the expansion guards. Restoring source destruction while keeping the guards made row B
   stall in all four classes, so non-destructive expansion is what recovers `.Base`/`.ZTime`.
   Widening `orderTrichotomy`'s first-witnesses-only restriction from one witness to two changed
   nothing, and neither did fuel at 20000/40000/120000.
2. *Blocking halting the branch rather than the time.* At `.Dense` the halted branch had ordering
   `[(4,3),(0,4),(3,2),(0,3),(0,2),(0,1)]` with `findUnexpanded` still pointing at
   `T(G ¬(p ∧ F q)) @ (0,0)`: one blocked interpolant was being treated as a verdict on the whole
   branch, abandoning it with propagation outstanding at the root, which is never blocked.
3. *`densityRule` diverging.* Deleting `densityRule` from `denseRules` made row B read `CLOSED`
   in all four classes, isolating it as the remaining cause. Its gap selection picked the *head*
   of the source's future and gave up if that one gap was filled; filling a gap changes the head
   and exposes a new unfilled gap, so it interpolated without bound from the root.

Both (2) and (3) are fixed in `Tableau.lean` — blocking now skips a blocked time as an expansion
*source* instead of halting the branch, and `densityRule` interpolates only into unfilled gaps
whose upper endpoint is maximal in the source's future. Row B is the only row either change
moves. -/

Each rule triggers on its axiom's antecedent *conjunction* and adds the consequent
persistently, so a row closes by contradiction between the added consequent and the negated

/-! ## R5 certificate-strength probe

These probes pin the state of the open-branch certificate. They were introduced to record a
gap and now record its closure, which is why they are worth keeping in both directions.

The gap was D4: `ExpandedTableau.hasOpen` carried *applied-set-aware* saturation rather than
`findUnexpanded … = none`, and on `◇p` the certificate had three applied-set entries all
orphaned off the branch — a consumable rule had deleted formulas a persistent rule produced,
the persistent rule was then suppressed by the applied set, and the branch was reported
saturated while `findUnexpanded` still found work.

Branch-guarded non-destructive expansion removed the mechanism. Nothing is deleted, so nothing
is orphaned; the applied set had nothing to suppress and was inert. That measurement
(`fullySaturated=true applied=0 orphans=0` on `◇p`) is what licensed R5's final step: the
applied set has now been **deleted from the certificate** and `ExpandedTableau.hasOpen` states
applied-set-free saturation, `findUnexpanded … = none`, at the tableau's own `FrameClass`.

So these rows no longer measure orphans — there is no applied set left to orphan. What they
measure now is the property whose failure would undo R5: that the *stronger* predicate is still
**reachable** on the pipeline's own output. `buildTableau` returns `none` rather than a
certificate whenever it is not, so a row flipping to `STALLED` is the regression signal, and the
pinned branch shape catches a silent change in what gets certified.

The genuinely-open row `G p → p` is the load-bearing one. It refutes the prediction that once
`serialityRule` landed no open branch would ever be fully saturated: seriality is deliberately
outside `allRulesForFC`, and `findUnexpanded` reads `allRulesForFC`, so full saturation stays
reachable and the certificate did **not** have to become a disjunction. The price is a
documentation obligation on the truth lemma, not a weaker certificate — a certified branch may
still be owed `T(F ⊤)`/`T(P ⊤)` at every label, which is harmless over a serial frame but must
be stated.

/-! ## Time-order totality probe (W rows)

The bridge from an open branch to a countermodel needs the branch's times linearly ordered,
not merely partially ordered. `Saturation.timeOrderTotal` is that requirement made decidable;
these rows measure it on the pipeline's own open certificates.

**All seven** rows now read `total=true incomparable=[]`. That was the gate for the order-level
branching rule, and `timeLinearity` — scheduled as the third expansion stage, after seriality —
is what delivers it. The rows stay here as the regression barrier: any change that reintroduces
an incomparable pair on an open certificate shows up as a `false` here.

The baseline moved twice on the way. Before `serialityRule`, W1-W4 were `false` and the controls
W5/W6 were already `true`, so the criterion read "W1-W4 flip while W5-W7 stay `true`". Seriality
mints a witness successor and predecessor at every label, so every row gained six or seven more
times and the two controls regressed `total=true → false`: the new times were exactly the ones
`timeLinearity` had not yet been built to order. That regression was expected and benign, which
is why the criterion became uniform across all seven rows rather than split between gate rows
and controls — and it is the version of the criterion that has now been met.

Three further facts are pinned along with the verdict, because each one is load-bearing:

- `knownTimes` used to omit any time whose formulas were all consumed, so in W1-W4 the
  *induced* order on `knownTimes` was empty even though `constraints` related both times to the
  root. Non-destructive expansion fixed that: the root time now appears (`[0, 2, 1]` rather than
  `[2, 1]`), so `constraints` and `knownTimes` agree and totality is measured against the real
  time set rather than an indexing artifact. That was the point of printing the fields
  alongside the verdict.
- The verdicts are **not** bought with fuel. W7 repeats W1 at 2000 — five times W1's own
  `linearityFuel` — and reports the same `total=true incomparable=[]`, so the flip is the rule
  firing, not a budget artifact. What fuel *does* control here is whether the ordering work
  finishes at all: below 400 these rows report `STALLED`, never a wrong order (see
  `linearityFuel` for the measured boundary). `orderTrichotomy` remains present in
  `allRulesForFC .Base` and remains inert on these rows — its branches are `temp_linearity`
  *formulas*, which mint fresh witness times rather than ordering existing ones.
- W1's two originally-incomparable siblings carry `T(G p)` and `F(p)`. That is why an arbitrary
  linear extension of the partial order would have been unsound: one extension is a model and
  the other is not, and the branch does not record which. `timeLinearity` does not extend
  arbitrarily — it splits three ways on the pair (`before`, `after`, and identification, the
  last of which *removes* a time from `knownTimes`), so each arm is a branch the search must
  justify separately rather than a choice made silently on the branch's behalf.

/-- Per-row fuel for the four rows whose ordering work does not fit `conformanceFuel`.

`timeLinearity` fires as a **three-way** split and `expandBranchWithFuel` allocates fuel
proportionally across a split's arms, so each firing divides the budget available below it.
W1-W4 order seven to ten times each and exhaust `conformanceFuel = 200` before they finish.

`400` is measured, not guessed, and is the smallest round bound that clears all four: at 200,
250 and 280 all four read `STALLED`; at 280-350 only W2 (and, from 350, W4) reaches
`total=true`; at 400 all four do, and the verdict is then stable through 800, 1200 and 2000.
W5 and W6 order fewer times and still clear at `conformanceFuel`, so they are left on it —
the override is confined to the rows that need it. -/
