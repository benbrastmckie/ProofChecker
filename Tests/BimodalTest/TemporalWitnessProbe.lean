# What the `untl`/`snce` cases actually demand of a saturated branch, measured before it is stated

`Tests/BimodalTest/RayRegionProbe.lean` measured one candidate demand — the **ray self-demand**,
`T(U(φ,ψ))` at a ray's chosen label needs `T(φ)` at that same label — and found it `true` on six
engine rows. This file measures the rest of the bundle, and it exists because of a gap in that
corpus: **not one of those six rows carries a genuine until.** `F p → p`, `P p → p`, `G p → p`
and the three modal shapes produce only `untl ⊤ ·` and `snce ⊤ ·`, where the acting rules are
`someFuturePos`/`someFutureNeg` (linear, and `sat_some_future_neg` already gives `F(φ)` at
*every* known future time). The branching `untlPos`/`untlNeg` rules — the ones whose second arm
is `T(guard) ∧ T(U)` resp. `F(guard) ∧ F(U)` — are never exercised. Any conclusion about them
drawn from that corpus is a conclusion about a case the corpus does not contain.

Rows H–L below are genuine untils and sinces (`U(p,q) → q`, `p → U(p,q)`, and mirrors), so the
branching arms fire.

## The six conditions per operator, and why each is the one the case needs

Write `r` for a carrier point, `L_r` for the label it reads (`stateLabel`), and recall that at
`ℤ` the placement is contiguous: between consecutive placed points there is **nothing**, and
every non-placed integer is on the lower ray (below all placed points) or the upper ray (above
all of them).

*Positive `untl` at a placed point.* `TruthAt … (untl φ ψ)` wants `s > r` with `φ` at `s` and `ψ`
at **every** carrier point strictly between. Contiguity turns "every carrier point strictly
between" into "every placed point strictly between", i.e. every known time strictly between the
two. So the case needs a φ-witness (`posWitness`) and the guard at every known time below the
*earliest* such witness. `posDichotomy` — every known future time carries `T(φ)` or `T(ψ)` — is
the clean sufficient form: below the earliest φ-witness no time carries `T(φ)`, so every one of
them carries `T(ψ)`.

*Positive `untl` on the upper ray.* Every point above an upper-ray point is on the same ray and
reads the same label, so the witness must be that label itself: `rayPos` is `RayRegionProbe`'s
`rayUp`, restated here so the whole bundle is measured in one place.

*Negative `untl`.* `F(U(φ,ψ))` at `L_r` must make `untl φ ψ` **false** at `r`, i.e. every `s > r`
either fails `φ` or has a `¬ψ` point strictly inside `(r,s)`. `negStrong` (`F(φ)` at every known
future time) settles it outright and is what `sat_some_future_neg` gives when `ψ = ⊤`.
`negCoDec` is the weaker, semantically exact form. `rayNeg` is the upper-ray instance: all points
above a ray point read one label, so that label must carry `F(φ)`.

`sat_untl_neg`, while it existed, gave only `F(φ)@t' ∨ F(ψ)@t'` for each known future `t'` — the
second arm's `F(U(φ,ψ))@t'` propagation was discarded — and neither disjunct alone settles the
`s = t'` case, where the guard interval `(r,s)` is empty. That was the specific reason `negStrong`
and `negCoDec` are measured rather than assumed. The theorem has since been **retired**: it was
read off the PASSIVE co-decomposition arm of `applyRule .untlNeg`, and when that arm was retired
the statement became false rather than merely unprovable. See the retirement note in
`Decidability/CountermodelExtraction.lean`. The reason `negStrong`/`negCoDec` are measured is
unaffected and is now the *only* reason they exist.

## THE PASSIVE-ARM RETIREMENT MOVED FOURTEEN ROWS IN THIS FILE — read this first

Everything in "What was measured" below was measured while the PASSIVE co-decomposition arms of
`.untlNeg`/`.snceNeg` still fired. Those arms have since been retired as unsound (see the arm
bodies in `Tableau.lean` for the argument and the authorization), and this file is the instrument
that shows what that cost. **Fourteen rows moved, and every one of them carries
`check=true → check=false`.**

The mechanism is exact and was predicted in advance. `untlNegFuture` — row `nStr` here — demands
`F(event)` at **every** known future time of every negative until. The only rule that ever placed
`¬event` at an *existing* future time on account of a negative until was the PASSIVE arm's branch
1. Retire the arm and that producer is gone, so `nStr` and the semantically exact `nCo` drop to
`false` on any branch with a negative until and a known future time, and `temporalWitnessCheck`
fails with them. The mirrors `sNRD`/`sPR`/`uPR`'s `self` diagnostics move for the same reason on
the past side.

**Consequence for every enumeration below.** The eight rows this file repeatedly describes as
"the rows the gate accepts" — A, B, C, D, E, F, I, K — are now **six**: I and K, the two genuine
negative-until/since rows, have joined H, J, M and N on the rejected side. Findings 2, 4, 6, 7
and 8 are stated against the old eight-row set and are left as written, because their content is
a comparison *among candidate rows on a fixed set of branches* and that comparison is unchanged;
what changed is which branches the landed gate admits. Read every "all eight rows the gate
accepts" below as "all eight rows the gate accepted before the retirement".

**This is a deliberate, authorized completeness regression, and it is larger than what was
declared.** The declared cost was two `TableauConformance` rows; the corpus in fact did not move
at all, and the cost landed here instead. It does not invalidate a landed theorem —
`temporalWitnessCheck` enters the truth lemmas as the *hypothesis* `hTW`, not as a derived fact,
and it was already `false` on the branches the engine actually builds. What it removes is the
last set of hand-built branches on which the hypothesis was discharged.

## What was measured

Three findings, none of them the one this file was written expecting.

**1. `posDichotomy` is refuted, and for a syntactic reason that governs the whole design.**
"Every known future time carries `T(φ)` or `T(ψ)`" is `false` on nine of the twelve rows —
including rows A, B, D and F, which contain no genuine until at all. The cause is that the guard
of a `someFuture` is `⊤`, and **the engine never writes `T(⊤)` on a branch**: `⊤` is true at every
point of every model without any branch fact saying so. Any candidate row that asks the branch to
*assert* the guard therefore fails on the entire `someFuture`/`somePast` fragment, for a reason
that has nothing to do with untils. The rows below consequently exempt `ψ = ⊤` explicitly, which
is the same split `sat_untl_pos` already makes (`by_cases hg : guard = Formula.top`); the `⊤` case
is discharged semantically, not from the branch.

**2. With that exemption, every candidate row holds on every row the existing gate accepts.**
On all eight rows reporting `check=true` — A, B, C, D, E, F, I, K — all ten of `gw`, `rdG`, `ruG`,
`wit`, `nStr`, `nCo`, `rP`, `rN` and their mirrors report `true`. Every `false` in the block sits
on one of the four rows (H, J, M, N) where `regionLabelCheck` **already** reports `false`. So the
bundle is a candidate *additional* gate, in the family `timeOrderTotal`/`boxAnchoredCheck`/
`regionLabelCheck` belongs to, and it is nowhere in conflict with the gate already landed.

**3. `negStrong` is true on all twelve rows, including the four the gate rejects.** `F(U(φ,ψ))` at
`(w,t)` puts `F(φ)` at *every* known time after `t`, genuine guard or not. That is much stronger
than the `F(φ)@t' ∨ F(ψ)@t'` the now-retired `sat_untl_neg` supplied, and it settles the negative
case outright, with no
minimal-witness argument and no reasoning about the guard interval.

**4. A second candidate is refuted: `untlNegAllRegions`.** "Every region label of a world denies
the event of every negative until in that world" is `false` on rows C and I, both of which the
gate accepts. It overreaches: `Bridge/RegionLabel.lean`'s `untlNegSubjects` demands the subject
only of untils asserted *strictly below* the region, which is the correct side condition — a
region below the until's own time contains no point above the evaluation point and is under no
obligation. The negative case therefore consumes the **existing** `regionLabel_untlNeg` for the
non-placed points and needs a new row only for the placed ones.

**5. The lower-ray negative demand is adoptable, and the strong form is free.** `untlNegRayLow` —
"a negative until asserted at its world's lower-ray label denies its event at *every* known time"
— is `true` on eleven of twelve rows, the single `false` being row N, where `regionLabelCheck` is
already `false`. The strictly weaker "at its own label only" variant fails on exactly that same
row, so extending the demand from the ray label to the whole of `b.knownTimes` costs nothing
anywhere in the corpus, and the strong form is the one the case actually needs. This is
Correction 12's negative residual, and it and its mirror `snceNegRayUp` are now rows 5 and 6 of
`Bridge/TemporalGate.lean`'s `temporalWitnessCheck`. See the "lower-ray negative demand" section
at the foot of this file.

**6. The two positive rows are adoptable only in strengthened forms, and both strengthenings are
free.** `gw` and `rdG` are measured but neither is usable as it stands. `gw` exempts the *whole*
row when `ψ = ⊤`, so it says nothing on the `someFuture` fragment — where the positive case still
needs a witness — and `rdG` permits the escape "the event sits at the ray's own label", which does
not close the lower-ray leaf because the ray label is a known time with placed points below it,
all of them inside the guard interval. `uGW` and `uRD` (and their mirrors) move the `⊤` exemption
inside the witness and delete the escape; both are `true` on all eight rows the gate accepts, and
neither ever differs from the weaker form it strengthens anywhere in the twelve. See "The positive
rows, in the exact form the proof consumes them" at the foot of this file. These are rows 7-10 of
`Bridge/TemporalGate.lean`'s `temporalWitnessCheck`.

**7. The interior-region generalisation of rows 5 and 6 is adoptable, and it subsumes them.** At
`ℤ` a non-placed point's region index is `0` or `n` (`RayOnly`), so rows 5 and 6 covered every
non-placed evaluation point. At `ℚ` and `ℝ` it can be interior, and `regionLabel b ord w j` for an
interior `j` is an arbitrary known time whose rank bears no relation to `j`, so neither row 5 nor
`untlNeg_spread` reaches from it. `untlNegRegionUp` is row 5 with `0` replaced by an arbitrary
`j`, narrowed to the two reaches the dense case consumes — the known times `v` with
`j ≤ branchRank b ord v`, and the labels of the regions `j' ≥ j`. It is `true` on all eight rows
the gate accepts; its single `false` is row N, where row 5 itself already reports `false` and
`regionLabelCheck` already rejects the branch. Both reaches fail together with the row they
subsume, so the generalisation costs **nothing** over row 5 anywhere in the corpus. At `j = 0`
both reaches are unrestricted and the first conjunct is row 5 verbatim, so adopting this retires
rows 5 and 6 rather than adding beside them. See "The interior-region negative demand" at the
foot of this file.

**8. The interior-region generalisation of the positive rows is adoptable, but only as a
disjunction, and it does not subsume the rows it generalises.** At `ℤ` a non-placed evaluation
point is on a ray: the lower one takes its witness from the known times (row 9) and the upper one
from its own region, with `Stepped` emptying the guard interval (row 3). At `ℚ` and `ℝ` the point
sits in an arbitrary region and `Stepped` is false, so the guard must be *carried* across a region
rather than vanished. `untlPosRegion` merges both leaves: a witness in the point's own region
(guard obligation at that region's label only) **or** a known time of rank at or above the region
(guard obligation at the placed points and the region labels the interval meets). Both are `true`
on all eight rows the gate accepts; every `false` sits on H, J, M or N, which `regionLabelCheck`
already rejects. The `self` diagnostic column shows why the disjunction is not decoration: `self`
alone is `false` on every genuine-until row, and the `known` disjunct alone is unsatisfiable at
the top region, where no known time has rank `n`. Because the `self` disjunct is an escape rows 9
and 10 do not offer, this row does **not** subsume them and is adopted beside them as rows 11 and
12 rather than in their place. See "The interior-region positive demand" at the foot of this file.

**A finding outside this file's scope, recorded because it is load-bearing elsewhere.**
`regionLabelCheck` is `false` on rows H, J, M and N — the branches the engine builds for
`U(p,q) → q` and `S(p,q) → q`. `regionLabelCheck b ord = true` is a *hypothesis* of
`not_valid_of_hasOpen_int`, so nothing already proved is affected; but sub-phase 7.3, which has
to discharge that hypothesis for the branches the engine actually produces, cannot discharge it
for these. That is a 7.3 obligation, measured here rather than discovered there.

## How to read a `false`

A `false` here is **not** a defect of the branch gates already landed. It is the measurement that
the corresponding row cannot be adopted as an additional gate row, and it must be recorded as a
DO-NOT-RE-ATTEMPT entry rather than proved around. `posDichotomy` is exactly that: finding 1
above is its DO-NOT-RE-ATTEMPT entry.

/-! ## Re-baseline record — the `trivialEventWitnessed` guard

The `#guard_msgs` expectations marked `RE-BASELINED (guard)` below were moved from their previous
pinned values. **Owner of every such move**: `FormalSystem/Metalogic/Decidability/Tableau.lean`'s
`def trivialEventWitnessed`, consulted as a disjunct beside `witnessPresent` in both fresh-label
guards of `findApplicableRule`. It is **not** owned by `Decidability/Saturation.lean` and **not**
by the semantics refactor. The guard stops the engine minting trivial seriality witnesses, so the
time domain stops growing without bound; the shorter time domains and the renumbered downstream
indices below are the direct consequence.

**Evidence — a three-point differential, not an inference.** Each row's value was measured at
three commits, with `#guard_msgs` output captured and compared row by row:

| Point | Commit | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| P0 | `edcecd551^` (`d49b977c0`) | guard defined but **not consulted** — pre-guard behaviour |
| P1 | `edcecd551` | guard consulted |
| P2 | current `HEAD` | today |

A row was re-baselined **only** when its pinned value equalled its P0 value — i.e. the row was
correct before the guard, so the guard is the sole cause of its present mismatch. Rows whose
pinned value already disagreed with P0 were **already stale before the guard**; those are the
separately-owned mismatches baselined 2026-07-29 against an engine-behaviour change owned outside
this refactor, and they are left pinned, unedited, and enumerated below. Re-baselining them would
absorb that separately-owned change into this attribution, which is exactly what the plan forbids.

The window `edcecd551^ .. HEAD` contains only the guard consultation plus proof-body-only edits to
three files (`CountermodelExtraction.lean`, `Verified/Bridge/TemporalSaturation.lean`,
`Verified/Termination/MintBound.lean`); those diffs add and remove no `def`, `abbrev`, `instance`,
`structure`, or `inductive` line at all, so no `#eval` here can have moved because of them. This is
corroborated directly in `TableauConformance.lean`, whose P1 and P2 values are identical on every
row.

**Re-baselined in this file** (guard-attributed): 11 row(s) at line(s) 481, 488, 500, 512, 528, 543, 570, 577, 898, 912, 932 — each carrying its own `RE-BASELINED (guard)` note with the old and new value.— each carrying its own `RE-BASELINED (guard)` note with the old and new value.

/-! ## Rows

Rows A–F are the six shapes `RayRegionProbe.lean` measured, carried over verbatim so the two
files can be read against each other. Every one reports `gen=false`: they contain no genuine
until or since at all, which is the gap this file exists to fill. Rows H–N are genuine.

The pinned strings are the whole measurement. The reading is in the module docstring's
"What was measured" section; in one line, **every row with `check=true` reports `true` on all
ten candidate rows, and every `false` sits on a row where `regionLabelCheck` is already
`false`.** That statement is unchanged by the movement noted below, and is in fact what the
movement respects.

## Row D moved, in all six probe helpers

Row D, `(□p ∧ ◇q) → r`, is the only multi-world shape among these six, and it is the only row
this file's cross-world temporal-copy deletion touched — at all six sites (`probe` through
`probe6`). Its `check` (`regionLabelCheck`) moved `true → false`, and in `probe` and `probe6` the
ray self-demands `rP`/`self` moved with it. The minted world no longer receives any
`T(G·)`/`T(H·)`, so it has no eligible region label; with no label the ray has nothing to read
and its self-demand is vacuously unmet rather than met. Nothing about the until/since analysis
changed — `wit`, `gw`, `rdG`/`ruG`, `nStr`, `nCo` and `rN` are unmoved on row D throughout, as
are all 65 other rows in this file. See `BoxNegPreservationProbe.lean` row 3 for the soundness
measurement that motivated the deletion, and `RegionGateProbe.lean` rows A/B/H for the same
effect measured on the candidate grid directly.

/-! ## A candidate that is refuted: the region labels are not uniformly negative

The negative `untl` case at a placed point needs `¬φ` at every carrier point above it, and the
points above it that are **not** placed read a region label. The obvious candidate row is that a
world's region labels all deny the event of every negative until in that world. They do not.

The reason is instructive and is exactly why the row is not needed: `Bridge/RegionLabel.lean`'s
`untlNegSubjects` already demands the subject of every `F(U(φ,ψ))` asserted **strictly below**
region `j`, and `regionLabel_untlNeg` consumes it. A region *below* the until's own time is under
no such demand, and should not be — no point of it is above the evaluation point. The candidate
row overreaches by dropping the "strictly below" side condition, and the corpus reports it.

/-! ## The lower-ray negative demand — Correction 12's residual, measured

The negative `untl` case at a **lower-ray** evaluation point is the one gap `untlNegFuture` plus
`regionLabel_untlNeg` do not close. A point below every placed point reads the label
`regionLabel … 0`; every carrier point above it is either a placed point, another lower-ray point
(reading that same label), or an upper-ray point (reading `regionLabel … n`). All three of those
labels are **known times**, and `untlNegFuture` reaches only the known times *strictly after* the
ray label — which is not all of them, because `regionLabel` picks the first eligible candidate and
not the order-minimal one.

So the demand is: a negative until asserted **at a world's lower-ray label** denies its event at
*every* known time of that world, its own label included. `snceNegRayUp` is the mirror at the
upper ray. `…Self` is the strictly weaker "at its own label only" variant, measured alongside so
that a `false` on the strong row says *which* part failed rather than merely that something did.

/-! ## The positive rows, in the exact form the proof consumes them

`gw` and `rdG` above are measured, but neither is in the shape the positive case can use, and the
difference is not cosmetic in either instance. Both strengthenings are measured here **before**
being stated in `Verified/`, and each is reported beside the weaker form it strengthens so that a
`false` says which part failed.

*The `⊤` exemption has to move inside the witness.* `untlPosGuardedWitness` exempts the whole row
when `ψ = ⊤`, so on the `someFuture` fragment it asserts nothing at all — and the positive case
still needs a witness there, because `TruthAt … (untl ⊤ φ)` demands one. The adopted form asks for
a future known time carrying the event **always**, and attaches the guard obligation only when
`ψ ≠ ⊤`. Pointwise on each signed formula that is exactly `gw`'s body when `ψ ≠ ⊤` and `wit`'s
body when `ψ = ⊤`, and `wit` is `true` on all twelve rows above; `uGW` measures the conjunction
directly rather than inferring it.

*The ray row's first disjunct is unusable and is dropped.* `untlRayDnGuard` permits the escape
`b.hasPosAt φ l` — the event at the ray's own label, with no guard obligation at all. That does
not close the case: the ray label is a *known time*, so the point placing it has placed points
strictly below it, and every one of those is strictly above the lower-ray evaluation point and
inside the guard interval. `regionLabel` picks the first eligible candidate, not the order-minimal
one, so nothing rules them out. The adopted form deletes the escape and keeps the guarded-witness
disjunct alone, again with the `⊤` exemption inside rather than outside.

/-! ## The interior-region negative demand — the dense carrier's residual, measured

Rows 5 and 6 (`untlNegRayLow`/`snceNegRayUp`) reach *every* known time, but their scope is
`j = 0` and `j = n` only. At `ℤ` that is the whole of it: `RayOnly` says a non-placed point's
region index is `0` or `n`, so the negative temporal case never meets an interior region. At `ℚ`
and `ℝ` it does, and `regionLabel b ord w j` for an interior `j` is an arbitrary known time whose
rank bears no relation to `j` — `regionLabel` picks the first eligible candidate, not the
order-minimal one — so neither row 5 nor `untlNeg_spread` reaches from it.

The candidate below is row 5 with `0` replaced by an arbitrary `j`, **narrowed to what the dense
`untl` case actually consumes**, which is two reaches and not one:

* the known times `v` at or above region `j` — `j ≤ branchRank b ord v` is exactly "`v`'s placed
  point lies above every point of region `j`", by `branchRank_lt_cutIndex`;
* the *labels* `regionLabel b ord w j'` of the regions `j' ≥ j` — a non-placed witness above a
  non-placed evaluation point reads one of these, and its rank says nothing about `j'`.

At `j = 0` both reaches are unrestricted (`0 ≤ branchRank v` always, and every `j'` qualifies) and
every region label is a known time, so the first conjunct alone is row 5 verbatim: the candidate
**subsumes** row 5 rather than sitting beside it. That is why it is measured here in the exact
form to be adopted, beside `uRL` — the row it would strengthen — and with its two conjuncts also
reported separately, so that a `false` says *which* reach failed.

/-! ## The interior-region positive demand — the dense carrier's other residual, measured

The positive halves at `ℤ` split a non-placed evaluation point into the two rays: the lower one is
row 9 (`untlRayDnGuard`, witness among the known times) and the upper one is row 3
(`untlRaySelf`) plus `Stepped` (witness in the point's own region, guard interval empty). At `ℚ`
and `ℝ` neither split survives — the point sits in an arbitrary region `j`, and `Stepped` is false,
so the "empty guard interval" is never available and the guard has to be *carried* across a
region instead of vanished.

The candidate below merges both `ℤ` leaves and generalises them to an arbitrary `j`. Its two
disjuncts are the two places a witness can be:

* **self** — a point of `r`'s own region, supplied by `exists_gt_sameRegion` rather than by a
  step. The whole guard interval then lies inside that one region (`sameRegion_convex`), so the
  only guard obligation is at the region's own label;
* **known** — a known time `v` whose placed point lies above the region, which is exactly
  `j ≤ branchRank b ord v`. The guard interval then meets placed points (known times `u` with
  `j ≤ branchRank u` and `u` before `v`) and non-placed points (regions `j'` with `j ≤ j'` and
  `j' ≤ branchRank v`), and the row has to carry the guard at both — the two bounds being
  `cutIndex_mono` and `cutIndex_le_branchRank` read off as branch facts.

The `⊤` exemption sits inside each disjunct, exempting the guard and keeping the witness, exactly
as rows 7-10 do: `TruthAt … (untl ⊤ φ)` still demands a witness.

Unlike the negative candidate this one does **not** subsume the rows it generalises — its `self`
disjunct is an escape rows 9 and 10 do not offer — so rows 3, 9 and 10 stay, and this is measured
beside them rather than as a replacement for them.
