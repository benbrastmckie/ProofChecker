Review /home/benjamin/Documents/Philosophy/Projects/ProofChecker/CLAUDE.md and /home/benjamin/Documents/Philosophy/Projects/ProofChecker/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md in order to determine what the best file structure and naming conventions are for this project, creating a plan to implement this refactor. Note that with the exception of the root directory, I prefer lower case project directory names in snake_case but want to follow what is most standard.
