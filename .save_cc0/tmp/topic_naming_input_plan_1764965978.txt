I want to integrate /home/benjamin/Documents/Philosophy/Projects/ProofChecker/Documentation/ProjectInfo/KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md into /home/benjamin/Documents/Philosophy/Projects/ProofChecker/Documentation/ProjectInfo/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md in order to reduce the burden of keeping the maintenance files updated. research all references to /home/benjamin/Documents/Philosophy/Projects/ProofChecker/Documentation/ProjectInfo/KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md in order to revise the maintenance system uniformly, providing a clear and consistent approach with no broken links.
