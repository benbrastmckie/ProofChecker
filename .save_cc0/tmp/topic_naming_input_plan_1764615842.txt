Research the proof-checker package described in /home/benjamin/Documents/Philosophy/Projects/ProofChecker/.claude/specs/001_proof_checker_package_docs/reports/001-research-the-proof-checker-package-descr.md and the LEAN 4 best practices given in /home/benjamin/Documents/Philosophy/Projects/ProofChecker/.claude/specs/002_lean4_proof_checker_best_practices/reports/001-research-the-best-practices-online-for-d.md as well as the coding and documentation standards in /home/benjamin/Documents/Philosophy/Projects/ProofChecker/.claude/specs/000_no_name_error/reports/001-i-just-created-this-proof-checker-repo-a.md in order to create a plan to set up an appropriate range of standards for developing this project. Note that the src/docs/ is reserved for code specific documentation whereas the ProofChecker/docs/ is reserved for general documentation and maintenance standards. Provide a plan which includes all standards documents to be created that make the most of the resources that I provided in order to streamline development of the LEAN 4 package.
