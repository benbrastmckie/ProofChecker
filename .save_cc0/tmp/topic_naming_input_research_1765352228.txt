Analyze why phases 2-5 and 7 of the proof automation tactics refactor plan (063) were deferred during implementation. Study the specific technical blockers: (1) Phase 2 - temporal K infrastructure for always_dni/always_dne, (2) Phase 3 - well-founded recursion for DeductionTheorem sorry markers, (3) Phase 4 - dependency on Phase 3 for future_k_dist/always_mono, (4) Phase 5 - metaprogramming complexity for tactic consolidation, (5) Phase 7 - helper lemma patterns. Examine the actual codebase state, identify what prerequisites are missing, and recommend how to structure focused follow-up plans.
