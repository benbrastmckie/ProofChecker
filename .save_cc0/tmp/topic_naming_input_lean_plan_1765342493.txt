Systematic codebase improvement plan: (1) Expand proof automation with missing tactics (modal_k_tactic, temporal_k_tactic, modal_4_tactic, modal_b_tactic, temp_4_tactic, temp_a_tactic, modal_search, temporal_search), (2) Derive axioms currently declared as assumptions (dni, future_k_dist, always_dni, always_dne, always_mono in Perpetuity.lean), (3) Eliminate sorry placeholders (11 total: 3 in Truth.lean, 3 in DeductionTheorem.lean, 3 in ProofSearch.lean, 1 in ModalS5.lean, 1 in Completeness.lean), (4) Refactor Perpetuity.lean (1889 lines) into smaller modules with extracted helper lemmas, (5) Standardize proof styles and eliminate code duplication (50+ axiom boilerplate patterns, 30+ modus ponens chains), (6) Standardize naming conventions (7 camelCase functions to snake_case), (7) Update documentation and comments throughout
