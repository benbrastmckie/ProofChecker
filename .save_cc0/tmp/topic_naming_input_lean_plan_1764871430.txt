Systematically improve ProofChecker semantic definitions to match the paper's app:TaskSemantics section. The current WorldHistory.lean uses integers as the temporal domain, but the paper defines a more general temporal order as a totally ordered abelian group. Research all semantic definitions in ProofChecker/Semantics/ and compare them to the definitions in /home/benjamin/Documents/Philosophy/Papers/PossibleWorlds/JPL/possible_worlds.tex (specifically app:TaskSemantics section). Create a plan to update all definitions to match the paper, and update TODO.md with new tasks including a reference link to the paper.
