I see that research identified missing files documented in README.md and CLAUDE.md (DSL.lean, Rules.lean, etc.). I also want to remove Counterexamples/ and I want the Archive/, Documentation/, ProofChecker/, and ProofCheckerTest/ directories to include README.md files that carefully document the directory contents for each following a documentation standard that should also be created in Documentation/Development/
