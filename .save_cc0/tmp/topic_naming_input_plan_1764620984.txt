Research and create a plan to improve the file structure for the project. I like the idea of having a central Examples/ directory with various types of examples in subdirectories. I also want to move the docs/src/ documents to wherever they belong, using the most natural directory naming conventions for these code specific standards and documentation by contrast with the more general ProofChecker/docs/ which should probably also be renamed to conform to directory naming conventions. Create a plan to do all this work systematically.
