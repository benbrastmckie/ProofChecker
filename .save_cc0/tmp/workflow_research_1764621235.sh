export WORKFLOW_DESCRIPTION="I am specifically interested in developing RL training loops to train AI systems to reason in the proof systems that I set up in the proof-checker. Conduct online research to see how best to achieve this by comparing other cases where AI systems are trained to reason in a LEAN implemented system. Also consider the findings /home/benjamin/Documents/Philosophy/Projects/ProofChecker/.claude/specs/005_lean4_language_research/reports/001-i-am-looking-to-build-a-proof-checker-pa.md in order to indicate whether it makes sense to develop this project in python in addition to LEAN 4."
