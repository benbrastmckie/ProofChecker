Implement Medium Priority Tasks 21-41 from TODO.md: Hilbert theorem derivations including propositional logic theorems (RAA, EFQ, LCE/RCE, LDI/RDI, RCP, ECQ, NE/NI, DE, BI/LBE/RBE) and modal S5/S4 theorems (box-diamond, box-conjunction, diamond-disjunction, S5 collapse, box-contraposition, consistency). Each theorem must be proven in Lean 4 with proper signatures as specified in TODO.md.
