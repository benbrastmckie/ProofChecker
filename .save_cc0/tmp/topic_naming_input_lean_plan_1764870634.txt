Clean up cruft from incorrect 'always' operator definition - systematically explore repository for unused frame constraints (BackwardPersistence, ModalTemporalPersistence), outdated documentation, stale comments, and code artifacts that assumed the wrong definition of 'always' before alignment with JPL paper definition (Pφ ∧ φ ∧ Fφ). Focus on improving codebase clarity by removing or updating these remnants.
