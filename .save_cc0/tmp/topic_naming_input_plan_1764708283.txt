I want /home/benjamin/Documents/Philosophy/Projects/ProofChecker/README.md to do a better job of introducing the proof-checker project in relation to the Logos project while nevertheless keeping things clear, accessible, and concise while focusing on the primary features and advantages of this project. Create a plan which begins by researching the ProofChecker/ project in order to update /home/benjamin/Documents/Philosophy/Projects/Logos/docs/packages/proof-checker.md and then proceeds to use the updated proof-checker.md document to update /home/benjamin/Documents/Philosophy/Projects/ProofChecker/README.md including links to the bimodal logic paper https://www.benbrastmckie.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/possible_worlds.pdf and the hyperintensional semantics developed in https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10992-021-09612-w and https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10992-025-09793-8 which lay the theoretical foundation for the layer 1 extension including the explanatory operators.
