research the NOTE tags in /home/benjamin/Documents/Philosophy/Projects/ProofChecker/README.md in order to create a plan to improve the document, adding important content while also pulling a natural narrative arc that avoids redundancy, opacity, or vagueness, providing a lucid introduction and discussion of the Logos project and its various constituents. I also want sections to include links either in-line where relevant or at the end of a section when helpful in a navigation bar like: 'See also: link | link | link'. Research these objectives and create a detailed implementation plan to systematically revise /home/benjamin/Documents/Philosophy/Projects/ProofChecker/README.md
