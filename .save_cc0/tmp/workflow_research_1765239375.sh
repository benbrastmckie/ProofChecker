export WORKFLOW_DESCRIPTION="I am working on implementing '### 18. Remove Derivable Axioms from Perpetuity.lean' from /home/benjamin/Documents/Philosophy/Projects/ProofChecker/TODO.md currently. Before proceeding to working on the '## Low Priority Tasks' in TODO.md, I want to conduct a systematic review of the axiom system, tactics, proofs, etc., throughout the repo so far in order to identify areas that could be improved. In particular, I want a minimal axiom system, deriving any theorems or axioms that may be useful to shorten other proofs. I also want to include any tactics that would help improve proofs, and to make sure that these tactics are used to improve proofs accordingly. I also want all comments and documentation to be complete and accurate. Review these elements in order to systematically identify any remaining gaps."
