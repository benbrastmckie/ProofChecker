# README.md NOTE Tag Research Report

**Research Date**: 2025-12-01
**Workflow Type**: research-and-plan
**Complexity**: 3
**Target Document**: /home/benjamin/Documents/Philosophy/Projects/ProofChecker/README.md

## Executive Summary

This report documents research findings for two NOTE tags in README.md requiring refactoring:

1. **NOTE 1 (line 3)**: Clarify that ProofChecker provides proof theory and metalogic for the Logos, beginning with the core layer (TM) with tense, modal, and extensional operators
2. **NOTE 2 (line 46)**: Verify emoji prohibition in project standards and remove all emojis from README.md

### Key Findings

- **Logos Context**: ProofChecker is Layer 0 (Core Layer) of the Logos formal language of thought project
- **Extensional Operators**: Boolean/propositional operators (¬, ∧, ∨, →) derived from ⊥ and → primitives
- **Emoji Policy**: Documentation standards explicitly prohibit emojis (U+1F300-U+1F9FF) but permit Unicode symbols
- **Emoji Occurrences**: Four emojis found on lines 40-58 (✓, ⚠️, 🏗️, 📋) requiring replacement

## Research Findings

### 1. Logos Project Context

#### What is the Logos?

**Source**: /home/benjamin/Documents/Philosophy/Projects/Logos/README.md (lines 1-61)

The **Logos** is a formal language of thought designed for scalable oversight in AI reasoning. It consists of:

**Core Layer (Layer 0) - ProofChecker's Domain**:
- **Extensional operators**: ¬ (negation), ∧ (conjunction), ∨ (disjunction), → (implication)
- **Modal operators**: □ (necessity), ◇ (possibility), Ca (ability/capacity)
- **Temporal operators**: P (past), F (future), G (always future), H (always past)

**Explanatory Extension (Layer 1)**:
- Counterfactual operators: □→, ◇→
- Causal operators: ○→
- Constitutive operators: ≤, ⊑, ≡

**Epistemic Extension (Layer 2)**:
- Belief operators: B
- Probability operators: Pr
- Epistemic modals: Mi, Mu

**Normative Extension (Layer 3)**:
- Deontic operators: O, P
- Preference operators: ≺
- Normative explanatory: ⟼

#### ProofChecker's Role in Logos

**Source**: /home/benjamin/Documents/Philosophy/Projects/ProofChecker/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md (lines 15-24)

ProofChecker implements:
- **Layer 0 (Core Layer)**: TM (Tense and Modality) logic with complete soundness/completeness proofs
- **Future Layers 1-3**: Planned extensions for explanatory, epistemic, and normative operators
- **Verification**: All valid reasoning verified by LEAN proof-checker

**Architecture Quote** (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, line 15):
> "This proof-checker implements a **layered operator architecture** aligned with the Logos project's extension strategy."

#### Three-Package Logos Architecture

**Source**: /home/benjamin/Documents/Philosophy/Projects/Logos/README.md (lines 10-28)

1. **Model-Builder**: Converts natural language contexts into formal semantic models
2. **Model-Checker**: Finds counterexamples to invalid inferences (Z3-based)
3. **Proof-Checker**: Verifies valid reasoning patterns (LEAN-based)

**ProofChecker is the third package**, providing verified reasoning for Layer 0 (Core TM) with planned extensions.

### 2. Extensional Operators

#### Definition

**Source**: /home/benjamin/Documents/Philosophy/Projects/ProofChecker/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md (lines 31-51)

**Extensional operators** are the Boolean/propositional operators:
- **Primitives**: ⊥ (falsity), → (material implication)
- **Derived operators** (defined as abbreviations):
  - `¬φ` (negation) ≡ `φ → ⊥`
  - `φ ∧ ψ` (conjunction) ≡ `¬(φ → ¬ψ)`
  - `φ ∨ ψ` (disjunction) ≡ `(¬φ) → ψ`

**Architecture Quote** (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, line 31):
```lean
-- Layer 0: Core formula type with extensional, modal, and temporal operators
-- Language BL = ⟨SL, ⊥, →, □, Past, Future⟩
inductive Formula : Type
  | atom : String → Formula                   -- Sentence letters (p_i)
  | bot : Formula                             -- Falsity (⊥)
  | imp : Formula → Formula → Formula         -- Material implication (→)
  | box : Formula → Formula                   -- Metaphysical necessity (□)
  | past : Formula → Formula                  -- Universal past (Past)
  | future : Formula → Formula                -- Universal future (Future)
```

#### Logos Core Layer Alignment

**Source**: /home/benjamin/Documents/Philosophy/Projects/Logos/README.md (lines 35-40)

Logos Core Layer lists extensional operators as:
- `¬` (negation)
- `∧` (conjunction)
- `∨` (disjunction)
- `→` (implication)

These are the **same operators** ProofChecker implements as Layer 0 derived operators.

### 3. Project Standards on Emojis

#### Documentation Standards Policy

**Source**: /home/benjamin/Documents/Philosophy/Projects/ProofChecker/.claude/docs/reference/standards/documentation-standards.md (lines 340-354)

**Allowed Unicode Characters**:
- Box-drawing (U+2500-U+257F): ├ │ └ ─ ┌ ┐ ┤ ┬ ┴ ┼
- Arrows (U+2190-U+21FF): ← → ↔ ↑ ↓
- Mathematical operators (U+2200-U+22FF): ≥ ≤ × ≠ ± ∞
- Bullets and punctuation (U+2000-U+206F): • – — … ‹ ›
- Geometric shapes (U+25A0-U+25FF): ▼ ▲ ■ □ ◆
- Miscellaneous symbols (U+2600-U+26FF): ⚠ ✓ ☐ ☑ ★

**Prohibited Characters**:
- **Emoji characters (U+1F300-U+1F9FF)**: 😀 🎉 ✨ 📝 🚀 ❌

**Rationale** (documentation-standards.md, line 353):
> "Unicode symbols are standard technical notation used in diagrams, lists, and documentation. Emojis cause UTF-8 encoding issues across different terminals and editors."

#### LEAN Style Guide Policy

**Source**: /home/benjamin/Documents/Philosophy/Projects/ProofChecker/docs/development/LEAN_STYLE_GUIDE.md

**No explicit emoji policy found** in LEAN Style Guide. The style guide focuses on LEAN code conventions, not markdown documentation.

**Conclusion**: Documentation standards explicitly forbid emojis. LEAN Style Guide does not address markdown emoji usage (out of scope).

### 4. Emoji Occurrences in README.md

#### Full Emoji Inventory

**Source**: /home/benjamin/Documents/Philosophy/Projects/ProofChecker/README.md (lines 40-58)

| Line | Section | Emoji | Unicode | Status | Replacement Recommendation |
|------|---------|-------|---------|--------|----------------------------|
| 40 | Completed Modules | ✓ | U+2713 | **ALLOWED** | Keep (checkmark in U+2600-U+26FF) |
| 48 | Partial Modules | ⚠️ | U+26A0 + U+FE0F | **ALLOWED** | Keep (warning in U+2600-U+26FF) |
| 53 | Infrastructure Only | 🏗️ | U+1F3D7 + U+FE0F | **PROHIBITED** | Replace with "Under Construction" or "WIP" |
| 57 | Planned | 📋 | U+1F4CB | **PROHIBITED** | Replace with "Planned" or "TODO" |

**Analysis**:
- **Lines 40, 48**: ✓ (checkmark) and ⚠️ (warning) are in U+2600-U+26FF (Miscellaneous Symbols), which is **explicitly allowed** in documentation standards
- **Line 53**: 🏗️ (building construction) is in U+1F300-U+1F9FF (emoji range), which is **explicitly prohibited**
- **Line 57**: 📋 (clipboard) is in U+1F300-U+1F9FF (emoji range), which is **explicitly prohibited**

**Correction to Initial Assessment**: Only 2 emojis (lines 53, 57) violate policy, not 4. The checkmark and warning symbols are permitted Unicode symbols, not emojis.

### 5. Additional Context from ARCHITECTURE.md

#### TM Logic Specification

**Source**: /home/benjamin/Documents/Philosophy/Projects/ProofChecker/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md (lines 26-28)

The bimodal logic **TM** (Tense and Modality) combines:
- **S5 Modal Logic**: Axioms MT, M4, MB for metaphysical necessity/possibility
- **Linear Temporal Logic**: Axioms T4, TA, TL for past/future operators
- **Bimodal Interaction**: Axioms MF, TF connecting modal and temporal operators

**Complete Operator Inventory for Layer 0**:
- **Extensional**: ⊥, →, ¬, ∧, ∨ (Boolean operators)
- **Modal**: □, ◇ (necessity, possibility)
- **Temporal**: Past, Future, past, future, always (△), sometimes (▽)

#### Perpetuity Principles

**Source**: /home/benjamin/Documents/Philosophy/Projects/ProofChecker/README.md (lines 28-34)

Six theorems connecting modal and temporal operators:
- P1: □φ → △φ (necessary implies always)
- P2: ▽φ → ◇φ (sometimes implies possible)
- P3: □φ → □△φ (necessity of perpetuity)
- P4: ◇▽φ → ◇φ (possibility of occurrence)
- P5: ◇▽φ → △◇φ (persistent possibility)
- P6: ▽□φ → □△φ (occurrent necessity is perpetual)

These demonstrate the **interaction between modal and temporal operators** that makes TM a bimodal system.

## Recommended Changes

### NOTE 1: Logos Context Clarification

**Current Line 3**:
```markdown
<!-- NOTE: make it clear that this package provides a proof theory and metalogic for the Logos, beginning with the core layer (TM) with tense, modal, and extensional operators -->
```

**Recommended Addition** (after line 5):
```markdown
## Project Context

ProofChecker provides the **proof theory and metalogic** for the **Logos**, a formal language of thought for scalable oversight in AI reasoning. This package implements **Layer 0 (Core Layer)** of the Logos architecture, which combines:

- **Extensional operators**: Boolean/propositional logic (¬, ∧, ∨, →)
- **Modal operators**: S5 modal logic for metaphysical necessity/possibility (□, ◇)
- **Temporal operators**: Linear temporal logic for past/future reasoning (Past, Future, always, sometimes)

The bimodal logic **TM** (Tense and Modality) provides verified reasoning for Core Layer operators, with planned extensions for explanatory, epistemic, and normative operators in future layers.

**Logos Integration**: ProofChecker is one of three packages in the Logos framework:
- **Model-Builder**: Constructs semantic models from natural language
- **Model-Checker**: Finds counterexamples to invalid inferences (Z3)
- **Proof-Checker**: Verifies valid reasoning patterns (LEAN)

See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for complete TM logic specification and Logos integration details.
```

**Rationale**:
- Explicitly states ProofChecker's role in Logos architecture
- Clarifies "extensional operators" as Boolean/propositional operators
- Positions TM as Layer 0 (Core Layer) with future extensions
- Links to detailed architecture documentation

**Recommendation**: Use plain text headers for maximum compatibility and clarity.

## Standards Validation

### Emoji Policy Confirmation

**Documentation Standards Explicit Policy** (.claude/docs/reference/standards/documentation-standards.md, lines 351-353):
- **Prohibited**: Emoji characters (U+1F300-U+1F9FF)
- **Examples**: 😀 🎉 ✨ 📝 🚀 ❌
- **Rationale**: UTF-8 encoding issues across terminals/editors

**Policy Confirmed**: Project standards explicitly forbid emojis.

**Emoji Violations Identified**:
1. Line 53: 🏗️ (U+1F3D7) - building construction emoji
2. Line 57: 📋 (U+1F4CB) - clipboard emoji

**Note on ✓ and ⚠️**: These are technically permitted (U+2600-U+26FF), but removing for consistency with plain text section headers.

## Conflicts and Considerations

### No Conflicts Identified

1. **Documentation Standards**: Clear emoji prohibition exists
2. **LEAN Style Guide**: No contradictory emoji policy (out of scope)
3. **Logos Context**: Well-documented in existing architecture documentation
4. **Extensional Operators**: Clearly defined in ARCHITECTURE.md

### Considerations for Refactoring

1. **Placement of Logos Context**: Should appear early (after Features section) to establish project context
2. **Section Header Styling**: Plain text recommended for maximum compatibility
3. **Visual Indicators**: If desired, use permitted Unicode symbols (U+2600-U+26FF) like ✓ or ⚠️, but plain text is clearer
4. **Link Verification**: Ensure all links to architecture documentation remain valid after refactor

## Next Steps for Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Logos Context Addition
1. Draft "Project Context" section explaining ProofChecker's role in Logos
2. Clarify extensional operators as Boolean/propositional operators
3. Position TM as Layer 0 with future layer extensions
4. Add Logos three-package architecture overview

### Phase 2: Emoji Removal
1. Remove 🏗️ from line 53 (Infrastructure Only)
2. Remove 📋 from line 57 (Planned)
3. Optionally remove ✓ and ⚠️ for consistency (though technically permitted)
4. Remove NOTE comment on line 46

### Phase 3: Validation
1. Verify no remaining emojis in README.md
2. Check link integrity to docs/ARCHITECTURE.md
3. Ensure Logos context aligns with ARCHITECTURE.md content
4. Run markdown linter if available

## Conclusion

Both NOTE requirements can be fully addressed:

1. **NOTE 1 (Logos Context)**: ProofChecker implements Layer 0 (Core Layer) of the Logos formal language, providing proof theory and metalogic for extensional (Boolean), modal (S5), and temporal (LTL) operators in the bimodal logic TM.

2. **NOTE 2 (Emoji Policy)**: Documentation standards explicitly prohibit emojis (U+1F300-U+1F9FF). Two emoji violations identified on lines 53 and 57 requiring removal. Symbols ✓ and ⚠️ are technically permitted but recommended for removal for consistency.

The refactoring plan should add comprehensive Logos context early in README.md and remove emoji characters to ensure standards compliance and terminal/editor compatibility.
