## Overview

This plan addresses two NOTE tags in README.md requiring refactoring:

1. **NOTE 1 (line 3)**: Add comprehensive Logos project context explaining that ProofChecker provides proof theory and metalogic for the Logos formal language of thought, implementing Layer 0 (Core Layer) with extensional, modal, and temporal operators.

2. **NOTE 2 (line 46)**: Remove prohibited emojis (🏗️ on line 53, 📋 on line 57) per documentation standards. Optionally remove permitted but inconsistent symbols (✓ on line 40, ⚠️ on line 48) for plain text consistency.

The refactor will improve clarity about ProofChecker's role in the Logos architecture and ensure standards compliance for emoji usage.

## Research Summary

The research report identified the following key findings:

**Logos Project Context**:
- ProofChecker is the third package in the Logos architecture (Model-Builder, Model-Checker, Proof-Checker)
- Implements Layer 0 (Core Layer) of Logos formal language with extensional (Boolean/propositional), modal (S5), and temporal (LTL) operators
- TM bimodal logic combines metaphysical necessity/possibility with past/future reasoning
- Future layers planned for explanatory (counterfactual), epistemic (belief), and normative (deontic) operators

**Extensional Operators Clarification**:
- Extensional operators are Boolean/propositional operators: ⊥, →, ¬, ∧, ∨
- Primitives: ⊥ (falsity), → (implication)
- Derived operators defined as abbreviations in terms of primitives

**Emoji Policy**:
- Documentation standards explicitly prohibit emoji characters (U+1F300-U+1F9FF)
- Unicode symbols in ranges U+2500-U+26FF are permitted (box-drawing, arrows, mathematical, bullets, shapes)
- Two prohibited emojis identified: 🏗️ (line 53), 📋 (line 57)
- Two permitted symbols identified: ✓ (line 40), ⚠️ (line 48) - optional removal for consistency

**Recommended Approach**:
- Add "Project Context" section after line 5 (after opening description) to establish Logos relationship early
- Remove two prohibited emojis and optionally remove two permitted symbols for plain text consistency
- Delete both NOTE comments (lines 3 and 46)
- Verify all documentation links remain valid post-refactor

## Success Criteria
- [ ] NOTE comment on line 3 removed
- [ ] New "Project Context" section added after line 5 explaining ProofChecker's role in Logos
- [ ] Extensional, modal, and temporal operators clearly described in context section
- [ ] Logos three-package architecture (Model-Builder, Model-Checker, Proof-Checker) mentioned
- [ ] Link to ARCHITECTURE.md provided for detailed specification
- [ ] NOTE comment on line 46 removed
- [ ] Prohibited emojis 🏗️ and 📋 removed from lines 53 and 57
- [ ] Plain text section headers used consistently (no visual indicator symbols)
- [ ] All existing documentation links verified and functional
- [ ] README.md passes markdown linting (no errors)

## Technical Design

### Approach

Use the Edit tool to make targeted changes to README.md, preserving all existing content except the two NOTE comments and emoji violations. The refactor will maintain the document structure and flow while enhancing clarity.

### Changes Required

**Change 1: Add Project Context Section**
- Location: After line 5 (after "A LEAN 4 implementation of an axiomatic proof system...")
- Content: New "## Project Context" section (approximately 15 lines)
- Includes:
  - ProofChecker's role as proof theory/metalogic for Logos
  - Layer 0 (Core Layer) implementation with three operator types
  - Bimodal logic TM description
  - Logos three-package architecture overview
  - Link to ARCHITECTURE.md for complete specification

**Change 2: Remove NOTE 1 Comment**
- Location: Line 3
- Action: Delete entire comment line

**Change 3: Remove Emoji Violations and NOTE 2**
- Location: Lines 40-58 (Implementation Status section)
- Actions:
  - Remove ✓ from line 40 heading ("Completed Modules ✓" → "Completed Modules")
  - Remove NOTE comment on line 46
  - Remove ⚠️ from line 48 heading ("Partial Modules ⚠️" → "Partial Modules")
  - Remove 🏗️ from line 53 heading ("Infrastructure Only 🏗️" → "Infrastructure Only")
  - Remove 📋 from line 57 heading ("Planned 📋" → "Planned")

### Design Rationale

**Why Add Context Early**: Establishing ProofChecker's role in Logos immediately after the opening description provides essential context for understanding the project's scope and purpose. Users need to know this is Layer 0 of a larger formal language framework.

**Why Remove All Symbols**: While ✓ and ⚠️ are technically permitted Unicode symbols (U+2600-U+26FF), removing them ensures:
1. Maximum terminal/editor compatibility
2. Consistent plain text formatting across all section headers
3. No ambiguity about emoji policy
4. Professional, distraction-free documentation

**Why Use Edit Tool**: Multiple targeted edits preserve file history and minimize diff size compared to rewriting large sections.

### Standards Alignment

**Documentation Standards Compliance**:
- Emoji prohibition (U+1F300-U+1F9FF): Addressed by removing 🏗️ and 📋
- Unicode symbol permission (U+2600-U+26FF): Honored but symbols removed for consistency
- Formal Symbol Backtick Standard: Not applicable (no formal logic symbols in refactored sections)
- Markdown format: Maintained throughout

**LEAN Style Guide**: Not applicable (README.md is not LEAN code)

**CLAUDE.md Project Standards**: README.md refactor aligns with documentation policy requiring clear project descriptions and standards compliance.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Add Project Context Section [COMPLETE]
dependencies: []

**Objective**: Insert new "Project Context" section after line 5 to explain ProofChecker's role in Logos architecture.

**Complexity**: Low

**Tasks**:
- [x] Use Edit tool to insert new section after line 5 (file: /home/benjamin/Documents/Philosophy/Projects/ProofChecker/README.md)
- [x] Include subsection describing extensional operators (Boolean/propositional: ¬, ∧, ∨, →)
- [x] Include subsection describing modal operators (S5: □, ◇)
- [x] Include subsection describing temporal operators (LTL: Past, Future, always, sometimes)
- [x] Include Logos Integration paragraph listing three packages (Model-Builder, Model-Checker, Proof-Checker)
- [x] Add link to docs/ARCHITECTURE.md for complete TM logic specification
- [x] Verify section formatting matches existing README.md style (heading levels, spacing)

**Testing**:
```bash
# Verify section added correctly
grep -q "## Project Context" /home/benjamin/Documents/Philosophy/Projects/ProofChecker/README.md

# Verify Logos mentioned
grep -q "Logos" /home/benjamin/Documents/Philosophy/Projects/ProofChecker/README.md

# Verify three operator types mentioned
grep -q "Extensional operators" /home/benjamin/Documents/Philosophy/Projects/ProofChecker/README.md

### Phase 2: Remove Emoji Violations [COMPLETE]
dependencies: [1]

**Objective**: Remove prohibited emojis and optional permitted symbols from Implementation Status section headers.

**Complexity**: Low

**Tasks**:
- [x] Use Edit tool to remove ✓ from line 40 heading (file: /home/benjamin/Documents/Philosophy/Projects/ProofChecker/README.md)
- [x] Use Edit tool to remove ⚠️ from line 48 heading
- [x] Use Edit tool to remove 🏗️ from line 53 heading
- [x] Use Edit tool to remove 📋 from line 57 heading

- [x] Run markdown linter if available (ignore warnings about line length for code blocks)
- [x] Visually review README.md for formatting consistency
- [x] Verify table of contents (if present) still accurate

**Testing**:
```bash
# Verify no NOTE comments remain
! grep "<!-- NOTE:" /home/benjamin/Documents/Philosophy/Projects/ProofChecker/README.md

# Verify ARCHITECTURE.md link is valid
test -f /home/benjamin/Documents/Philosophy/Projects/ProofChecker/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md

test -f /home/benjamin/Documents/Philosophy/Projects/ProofChecker/docs/KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md
test -f /home/benjamin/Documents/Philosophy/Projects/ProofChecker/docs/glossary/logical-operators.md

# Run markdown linter (if markdownlint is available)
command -v markdownlint >/dev/null 2>&1 && markdownlint /home/benjamin/Documents/Philosophy/Projects/ProofChecker/README.md || echo "markdownlint not available, skipping"

# Verify README.md is valid UTF-8
file /home/benjamin/Documents/Philosophy/Projects/ProofChecker/README.md | grep -q "UTF-8"
```

**Expected Duration**: 0.75 hours

**Validation Checklist**:
- [x] Both NOTE comments removed
- [x] Project Context section present and complete
- [x] All prohibited emojis removed
- [x] All documentation links valid
- [x] Markdown formatting consistent
- [x] File is valid UTF-8
- [x] No linting errors

## Testing Strategy

### Test Approach

**Grep-Based Validation**: Use grep to verify content changes applied correctly without requiring full markdown parser.

**Link Validation**: Verify all referenced documentation files exist at expected paths.

**Standards Compliance**: Ensure no prohibited emoji characters remain using Unicode range matching.

**Manual Review**: Visually review README.md in rendered markdown viewer (e.g., GitHub preview, VS Code preview) to verify formatting and readability.

### Test Coverage

**Phase 1 Tests**:
- Section presence verification (Project Context heading exists)
- Content verification (Logos, operator types, architecture link present)
- Formatting verification (heading levels, spacing consistent)

**Phase 2 Tests**:
- Emoji removal verification (prohibited emojis absent)
- Section header format verification (plain text only)
- Content preservation verification (only headers changed)

**Phase 3 Tests**:
- NOTE comment removal verification (no NOTE tags remain)
- Link validation (all documentation links resolve)
- UTF-8 encoding verification (file is valid UTF-8)
- Markdown linting (optional, if markdownlint available)

### Success Criteria

All 10 success criteria must pass:
1. NOTE comments removed (2 locations)
2. Project Context section added with complete content
3. Operator types described (extensional, modal, temporal)
4. Logos architecture mentioned (three packages)
5. ARCHITECTURE.md link added and valid
6. Prohibited emojis removed (🏗️, 📋)
7. Section headers plain text (no symbols)
8. Documentation links validated (all exist)
9. No markdown linting errors
10. UTF-8 encoding valid

## Documentation Requirements

### Files to Update

**README.md** (primary target):
- Add Project Context section
- Remove NOTE comments
- Remove emoji violations
- Preserve all existing content and links

**No Other Files Require Updates**: This refactor is isolated to README.md. All referenced documentation files (ARCHITECTURE.md, IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md, etc.) already exist and contain accurate content.

### Documentation Standards Compliance

**Formal Symbol Backtick Standard**: Not applicable to this refactor (no formal logic symbols added/modified in refactored sections).

**Emoji Prohibition**: Enforced by removing 🏗️ and 📋.

**Unicode Symbol Permission**: Honored (✓ and ⚠️ are permitted but removed for consistency).

**Markdown Formatting**: Maintained throughout refactor.

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies

None. This refactor requires only standard Unix tools (grep, file) available on all systems.

### Project Dependencies

**Existing Documentation Files**:
- /home/benjamin/Documents/Philosophy/Projects/ProofChecker/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md (must exist for link validation)
- /home/benjamin/Documents/Philosophy/Projects/ProofChecker/docs/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md (existing link)
- /home/benjamin/Documents/Philosophy/Projects/ProofChecker/docs/KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md (existing link)
- /home/benjamin/Documents/Philosophy/Projects/ProofChecker/docs/glossary/logical-operators.md (existing link)

**Research Reports**:
- /home/benjamin/Documents/Philosophy/Projects/ProofChecker/.claude/specs/015_readme_note_refactor_plan/reports/001-readme-note-research-report.md (informs refactor decisions)

### Prerequisites

None. README.md exists and is ready for refactoring.

## Risk Analysis

### Low Risk Refactor

This refactor has minimal risk because:
1. Changes are isolated to README.md (no code changes)
2. Edit tool preserves file history and enables easy rollback
3. No functional impact on ProofChecker implementation
4. All existing content preserved (only additions and emoji removals)

### Potential Issues

**Markdown Rendering Differences**: Different markdown renderers may display content slightly differently. Mitigation: Test in multiple viewers (GitHub, GitLab, VS Code).

**Link Rot**: Documentation links may become invalid if files are moved. Mitigation: Validate all links as part of Phase 3 testing.

**UTF-8 Encoding Issues**: Emoji removal may leave invalid UTF-8 sequences. Mitigation: Verify file encoding in Phase 3 testing.

### Rollback Plan

If refactor introduces issues:
1. Use git to revert README.md to previous commit
2. Review Edit tool changes to identify problematic edits
3. Re-apply changes incrementally with additional validation

## Notes

**Complexity Score Calculation**:
```
Score = Base(refactor=5) + Tasks(15)/2 + Files(1)*3 + Integrations(0)*5
Score = 5 + 7.5 + 3 + 0 = 15.5

With dependencies factor (3 doc files): 15.5 + 3*2 = 21.5
With testing factor (grep, link validation): 21.5 + 1 = 22.5

Tier: 22.5 < 50, therefore Tier 1 (Single File)
```

**Phase Dependencies**:
- Phase 1 has no dependencies (can start immediately)
- Phase 2 depends on Phase 1 (context section should be added before removing emojis to maintain document flow)
- Phase 3 depends on both Phase 1 and 2 (validates all changes together)

**Progressive Planning Note**:
This plan uses Level 0 (single file) structure as calculated complexity score (22.5) is well below Tier 2 threshold (50). The three phases are straightforward documentation edits with clear success criteria and testing commands.

**Standards Alignment Note**:
This refactor enforces documentation standards compliance (emoji prohibition) and improves project documentation clarity (Logos context). No standards divergence detected.
