## 1. Current Status Analysis

### 1.1 ProofChecker README.md Current State

**Location**: `/home/benjamin/Documents/Philosophy/Projects/ProofChecker/README.md`

**Strengths**:
- Clear technical structure with well-organized sections
- Comprehensive implementation status documentation
- Detailed feature lists and module descriptions
- Good developer documentation references

**Weaknesses**:
- **Minimal Logos context**: Only briefly mentions "third package in the Logos architecture" (lines 32-38)
- **No theoretical grounding**: Missing references to the foundational papers (possible worlds semantics, hyperintensional semantics)
- **Incomplete positioning**: Doesn't explain WHY ProofChecker matters beyond technical implementation
- **Missing integration story**: Limited explanation of how it fits with model-builder and model-checker
- **Buried advantages**: Key benefits are scattered rather than prominently featured

**Key Gaps Identified**:
1. No mention of bimodal logic paper (https://www.benbrastmckie.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/possible_worlds.pdf)
2. No reference to hyperintensional semantics foundations (Brast-McKie 2021, 2025 papers)
3. Missing explanation of task semantics theoretical significance
4. Insufficient connection to Layer 1 extensions (explanatory operators)
5. Weak positioning within transparent AI reasoning framework

### 1.2 Logos proof-checker.md Current State

**Location**: `/home/benjamin/Documents/Philosophy/Projects/Logos/docs/packages/proof-checker.md`

**Strengths**:
- Good conceptual overview of proof system construction
- Clear explanation of DSL integration
- Comprehensive coverage of metalogical properties
- Strong utility-based proof library concept

**Weaknesses**:
- **Outdated content**: Describes planned features that conflict with actual ProofChecker implementation
- **Wrong architecture description**: Mentions "proof library (proof_lib)" which doesn't exist in current implementation
- **Misleading DSL claims**: Presents DSL as implemented when it's actually planned (Syntax/DSL.lean incomplete)
- **Inconsistent with reality**: Layer 0 MVP status not reflected in documentation
- **Missing current capabilities**: Doesn't mention completed Syntax, ProofSystem, Semantics packages

**Critical Misalignments**:
1. Claims DSL syntax is implemented (it's planned)
2. Describes proof utility ranking system (doesn't exist yet)
3. Implies axiom minimization features (not implemented)
4. Suggests dual-mode operation (application/contemplation) not in current codebase
5. Presents as fully functional system rather than Layer 0 MVP

## 2. ProofChecker Project Deep Dive

### 2.1 Core Implementation: Bimodal Logic TM

**TM System Components**:

```
Logic TM = Tense + Modality
├── S5 Modal Logic (Metaphysical necessity/possibility)
│   ├── MT axiom: □φ → φ (reflexivity/truth)
│   ├── M4 axiom: □φ → □□φ (positive introspection)
│   └── MB axiom: φ → □◇φ (symmetry)
├── Linear Temporal Logic (Past/Future operators)
│   ├── T4 axiom: Fφ → FFφ (transitivity)
│   ├── TA axiom: φ → F(Pφ) (temporal accessibility)
│   └── TL axiom: △φ → G(Hφ) (temporal perpetuity)
└── Bimodal Interaction Axioms
    ├── MF axiom: □φ → □Fφ (modal persistence)
    └── TF axiom: □φ → F□φ (temporal necessity)
```

**Significance**:
- First LEAN 4 implementation of TM bimodal logic
- Combines metaphysical and temporal reasoning systematically
- Enables reasoning about perpetuity principles (P1-P6)
- Foundation for Layer 1 extensions (counterfactual, epistemic, normative operators)

### 2.2 Task Semantics Innovation

**Key Theoretical Insight** (from possible worlds paper):

Traditional modal logic uses possible worlds as primitive, unanalyzed entities. Task semantics provides a compositional account where:

```
World History = Function from Times to World States
Task Relation = w ⇒ₓ w' (state w performs task for duration x to reach w')
```

**Critical Properties**:
1. **Nullity**: `w ⇒₀ w` (identity task at same time)
2. **Compositionality**: `w ⇒ₓ u ∧ u ⇒ᵧ v → w ⇒ₓ₊ᵧ v` (task composition)
3. **Convexity**: World histories span continuous time intervals (no gaps)

**Implementation in ProofChecker**:
- `TaskFrame.lean` (145 LOC): Task relation structure
- `WorldHistory.lean` (120 LOC): Possible worlds as functions
- `TaskModel.lean` (75 LOC): Valuation over task frames
- `Truth.lean` (185 LOC): Modal and temporal truth evaluation

**Why This Matters**:
- Provides formal foundation for model-checker's state-based semantics
- Enables reasoning about temporal change and persistence
- Supports counterfactual reasoning about alternative task sequences (Layer 1)

### 2.3 Implementation Status: Layer 0 MVP

**Completed Components** (5/8 packages, 63%):

1. **Syntax Package** (100% complete)
   - Formula inductive type with 6 constructors
   - Context management (premise lists)
   - DSL planned but not yet implemented

2. **ProofSystem Package** (100% complete)
   - All 8 TM axioms defined
   - All 7 inference rules (MP, MK, TK, TD, weakening)
   - Derivability relation fully specified

3. **Semantics Package** (100% complete)
   - Complete task frame structure
   - World history construction
   - Truth evaluation at model-history-time triples
   - Validity and semantic consequence relations

4. **Perpetuity Theorems** (50% complete)
   - P1-P3 proven (P3 fully, P1-P2 use propositional helpers with `sorry`)
   - P4-P6 incomplete (complex modal-temporal reasoning)

5. **Test Suite** (100% for completed modules)
   - Comprehensive coverage of Syntax, ProofSystem, Semantics
   - Integration tests for cross-module functionality

**Partial Components** (2/8 packages, 25%):

1. **Metalogic/Soundness** (60% complete)
   - 5/8 axioms validity proven (MT, M4, MB, T4, TA)
   - 4/7 inference rules soundness proven
   - Missing: TL, MF, TF axioms (require frame constraints)
   - Missing: Modal K, Temporal K, Temporal Duality rules

2. **Metalogic/Completeness** (0% proofs, infrastructure only)
   - Type signatures defined using `axiom` keyword
   - Canonical model structure specified
   - Truth lemma statement present (no proof)
   - Weak/strong completeness statements (no proofs)

**Infrastructure Only** (1/8 packages, 12%):

1. **Automation/Tactics** (0% implementation)
   - 12 tactic stubs declared
   - All use `sorry` bodies
   - No automation available

**Key Limitations**:
- No DSL implementation (planned in Syntax/DSL.lean)
- No proof automation (tactics are stubs)
- No decidability module (not started)
- Partial metalogic (soundness gaps, completeness infrastructure only)

**Estimated Completion Effort**: 155-215 hours for full Layer 0

### 2.4 Layered Architecture Strategy

**Layer 0 (Core TM)** - Current MVP:
- Extensional operators: `⊥`, `→`, `¬`, `∧`, `∨`
- Modal operators: `□`, `◇`
- Temporal operators: `Past`, `Future`, `past`, `future`, `△`, `▽`
- Status: MVP complete with partial metalogic

**Layer 1 (Explanatory Extension)** - Planned:
- Counterfactual: `□→`, `◇→`
- Causal: `○→`
- Constitutive: `≤`, `⊑`, `≡`
- Requires: Selection functions, grounding relations
- Foundation: Hyperintensional semantics papers

**Layer 2 (Epistemic Extension)** - Future:
- Belief: `B`
- Probability: `Pr`
- Epistemic modals: `Mi`, `Mu`
- Indicative conditional: `⟹`

**Layer 3 (Normative Extension)** - Future:
- Deontic: `O`, `P`
- Preference: `≺`
- Normative explanatory: `⟼`

**Strategic Advantages**:
1. Incremental delivery of verified reasoning capabilities
2. Clear conceptual separation between operator types
3. Each layer independently valuable
4. Foundation built before complexity added

**Relevance to README**:
This paper provides the theoretical foundation for ProofChecker's semantics. The task relation formalization is the core innovation distinguishing this from standard modal logic implementations.

### 3.2 Hyperintensional Semantics Papers

**Paper 1**: "Identity and Aboutness" (2021)
- **URL**: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10992-021-09612-w
- **Key Contribution**: State-based semantics with verifier/falsifier pairs
- **Relevance**: Foundation for model-checker integration, Layer 1 grounding operators

**Paper 2**: "Counterfactual Worlds" (2025)
- **URL**: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10992-025-09793-8
- **Key Contribution**: Tensed counterfactuals with selection functions
- **Relevance**: Theoretical foundation for Layer 1 counterfactual operators

**Why These Matter**:
- Provide formal semantics for explanatory operators (Layer 1)
- Enable fine-grained distinctions impossible in intensional semantics
- Support causal, constitutive, and counterfactual reasoning
- Bridge from Layer 0 TM to Layer 1 extensions

### 3.3 Integration with Model-Checker

**Model-Checker Connection** (from Logos README):
- Model-checker implements hyperintensional semantics in Z3
- Current version: v1.2.12
- Provides semantic verification for ProofChecker theorems
- Generates counterexamples for invalid inferences

**ProofChecker Role**:

**Bidirectional Flow**:
```
ProofChecker ⟺ Model-Checker ⟺ Model-Builder
   (Syntax)      (Semantics)    (NL Interface)
     LEAN            Z3             LLM
```

## 4. Logos Project Context

### 4.1 Three-Package Architecture

**Vision** (from Logos README):
> "A formal language of thought for AI reasoning, combining a proof theory implemented in LEAN with semantics implemented in the model-checker using Z3. This dual verification architecture generates infinite clean training data."

**Package Roles**:

1. **Model-Builder** (Design Phase)
   - Transforms natural language → formal semantics
   - Five generative outputs: FLF, SRS, SMS, SCP, SRI
   - Creates semantic models for Logos interpretation
   - Enables AI systems to construct interpretations

2. **Model-Checker** (Active Development, v1.2.12)
   - Z3-based semantic verification
   - Implements hyperintensional semantics
   - Generates counterexamples for invalid inferences
   - Provides corrective RL training signals

3. **ProofChecker** (Layer 0 MVP Complete)
   - LEAN 4 proof theory implementation
   - Syntactic verification of inferences
   - Generates valid theorems as training data
   - Provides positive RL training signals

### 4.2 Transparent AI Reasoning Framework

**Core Insight** (from transparency.md):
> "Models in logic are used TO interpret formal languages. Instead of referring to LLMs as 'models,' it makes better sense to refer to these structures simply as AIs or LLMs."

**ProofChecker's Role in Transparency**:
1. **Verifiable Reasoning**: Every proof step can be independently checked
2. **Auditable Inferences**: Proof receipts provide mathematical certainty
3. **Transparent Semantics**: Task models explicitly represent world states
4. **Accountable Decisions**: Formal proofs justify AI conclusions

**Human Cognition Parallel**:
> "Adult human agents are expected to be able to accurately account for why they acted as they have... The aim of this project is to equip AI systems with a capacity for interpretation, self-reflection, and transparent reasoning."

ProofChecker provides the formal reasoning infrastructure enabling this transparent accountability.

### 4.3 Dual Verification Training Architecture

**Training Data Generation**:

```
Positive RL Signals (ProofChecker):
├── Unlimited valid theorems from axioms
├── Proof receipts with mathematical certainty
└── Immediate verification feedback

Corrective RL Signals (Model-Checker):
├── Unlimited counterexamples for invalid reasoning
├── Concrete semantic scenarios showing failures
└── Precise error localization
```

**Self-Supervised Learning**:
- No human labeling required
- Proof receipts = positive training signal
- Countermodels = corrective training signal
- Scales with computational resources, not annotation

**ProofChecker's Contribution**:
- Generates infinite theorems through systematic derivation
- Provides positive reinforcement for valid inferences
- Creates cached proof library for efficient reasoning
- Enables systematic mastery of logical patterns

### 4.4 Scalable Oversight Integration

**Vision** (from scalable_oversight.md):
> "Verification is integrated into training rather than imposed as an external bottleneck."

**ProofChecker's Oversight Role**:

1. **Proof Library Caching**:
   - Stores verified inference patterns
   - Retrieves cached proofs for routine reasoning
   - Applies full verification to novel inferences
   - Scales efficiently with growing library

2. **Theorem Generation Pipeline**:
   - Systematic derivation from TM axioms
   - No need for human-annotated training data
   - Computational scaling rather than labor scaling
   - Unlimited training signal generation

3. **Verification Before Deployment**:
   - Model-builder constructs semantic models
   - ProofChecker verifies inferences syntactically
   - Model-checker validates semantically
   - Combined verification ensures correctness

- **GitHub Repository**: [github.com/benbrastmckie/ProofChecker](https://github.com/benbrastmckie/ProofChecker)
- **Current Status**: Layer 0 (Core TM) MVP Complete
- **LEAN Version**: 4.14.0 or later

## Theoretical Foundations

### Task Semantics Innovation

ProofChecker implements the task semantics developed in Brast-McKie's [Possible Worlds paper](https://www.benbrastmckie.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/possible_worlds.pdf),
providing a compositional account of possible worlds as functions from times to world
states constrained by task relations:

- **World Histories**: Functions from convex time sets to world states
- **Task Relation**: `w ⇒ₓ w'` (state w performs task for duration x to reach w')
- **Key Properties**: Nullity (`w ⇒₀ w`), Compositionality (task composition)

This innovation provides the formal foundation for ProofChecker's semantics and enables
extensions to counterfactual reasoning about alternative task sequences.

### Hyperintensional Extensions Foundation

The task semantics integrates with hyperintensional frameworks from:
- [Identity and Aboutness](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10992-021-09612-w)
  (2021): State-based semantics with verifier/falsifier pairs
- [Counterfactual Worlds](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10992-025-09793-8)
  (2025): Tensed counterfactuals with selection functions

These provide the theoretical basis for Layer 1 extensions incorporating counterfactual,
causal, and constitutive operators for explanatory reasoning.

## Core Components

### 1. Bimodal Logic TM

**S5 Modal Logic** (Metaphysical Necessity/Possibility):
- `MT`: `□φ → φ` (truth/reflexivity)
- `M4`: `□φ → □□φ` (positive introspection)
- `MB`: `φ → □◇φ` (symmetry)
- `MK`: Modal K rule for necessitation

**Linear Temporal Logic** (Past/Future):
- `T4`: `Fφ → FFφ` (temporal transitivity)
- `TA`: `φ → F(Pφ)` (temporal accessibility)
- `TL`: `△φ → G(Hφ)` (temporal perpetuity)
- `TK`: Temporal K rule for futurization

**Bimodal Interaction**:
- `MF`: `□φ → □Fφ` (modal persistence through time)
- `TF`: `□φ → F□φ` (temporal persistence of necessity)

**Perpetuity Principles** (P1-P6): Novel theorems connecting modal and temporal operators:
- `P1`: `□φ → △φ` (necessity implies always)
- `P2`: `▽φ → ◇φ` (sometimes implies possibility)
- `P3`: `□φ → □△φ` (necessity of perpetuity) - **Fully proven**

### 2. Task Semantics Implementation

**Semantic Structures**:
- **TaskFrame**: World states, times (integers), task relation
- **WorldHistory**: Functions from convex time sets to world states
- **TaskModel**: Task frame with valuation function
- **Truth Evaluation**: Recursive evaluation at model-history-time triples

**Modal Truth**: `M, τ, t ⊨ □φ` iff for all histories σ, `M, σ, t ⊨ φ`
**Temporal Truth**: `M, τ, t ⊨ Fφ` iff for all future times s > t, `M, τ, s ⊨ φ`

### 3. Metalogical Properties

**Soundness** (Partial Implementation):
- **Proven**: MT, M4, MB, T4, TA axioms (5/8)
- **Proven**: Axiom, assumption, modus ponens, weakening rules (4/7)
- **Incomplete**: TL, MF, TF axioms (require frame constraints)
- **Incomplete**: Modal K, Temporal K, Temporal Duality rules

**Completeness** (Infrastructure Only):
- Type signatures defined using LEAN `axiom` keyword
- Canonical model structure specified
- Truth lemma statement present (no proof yet)
- Weak/strong completeness statements (no proofs yet)

**Estimated Completion**: 155-215 hours for full Layer 0 metalogic

### 4. Current Implementation Status

**Completed** (5/8 packages, 63%):
- ✓ Syntax: Formula types, contexts, derived operators
