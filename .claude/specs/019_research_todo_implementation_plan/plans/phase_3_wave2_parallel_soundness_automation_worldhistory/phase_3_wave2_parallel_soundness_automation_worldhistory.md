## Implementation Progress (2025-12-03)

### Completed Work

#### Task 3A.1: TL Axiom Proof ✅ COMPLETE
**File**: `ProofChecker/Metalogic/Soundness.lean`

**What was done**:
1. Added classical logic helper `and_of_not_imp_not` to extract conjunction from negated implication encoding
2. Completed proof of `temp_l_valid` using:
   - `simp only [Formula.always, Formula.and, Formula.neg, truth_at]` to unfold conjunction encoding
   - Classical extraction via `and_of_not_imp_not` to get `h_past`, `h_now`, `h_future`
   - Case split using `Int.lt_trichotomy r t` for three cases (r < t, r = t, t < r)

**Paper Correspondence**: Follows paper proof at line 2334 - given `always φ` (φ at all times), proving `Future Past φ` is immediate since any past time of any future time is still "all times."

#### Task 3A.2: Time-Shift Infrastructure ✅ COMPLETE
**File**: `ProofChecker/Semantics/WorldHistory.lean`

**What was implemented**:
```lean
/-- Time-shifted history construction.
Given history σ and shift offset Δ, construct τ where:
- τ.domain z ↔ σ.domain (z + Δ)
- τ.states z = σ.states (z + Δ)
-/
def time_shift (σ : WorldHistory F) (Δ : Int) : WorldHistory F where
  domain := fun z => σ.domain (z + Δ)
  states := fun z hz => σ.states (z + Δ) hz
  respects_task := by
    -- Duration (t - s) is preserved under translation: (t + Δ) - (s + Δ) = t - s
    intros s t hs ht hst
    have h_shifted : (s + Δ) ≤ (t + Δ) := Int.add_le_add_right hst Δ
    have h_duration : (t + Δ) - (s + Δ) = t - s := by omega
    rw [← h_duration]
    exact σ.respects_task (s + Δ) (t + Δ) hs ht h_shifted
```

**Paper Correspondence**: Matches Definition 12 (def:time-shift-histories) at line 1873:
- `τ ≈_y^x σ` witnessed by `ā(z) = z - x + y`
- `dom(σ) = ā⁻¹(dom(τ))`
- `σ(z) = τ(ā(z))` for all z ∈ dom(σ)

**Also added**:
- `time_shift_domain_iff`: Domain membership equivalence
- `time_shift_inverse_domain`: Double shift cancellation

#### Task 3A.4: MF Axiom Proof ✅ COMPLETE
**File**: `ProofChecker/Metalogic/Soundness.lean` (lines 400-423)

**What was done**:
Proved `modal_future_valid` using time-shift preservation:
```lean
theorem modal_future_valid (φ : Formula) : ⊨ ((φ.box).imp ((φ.future).box)) := by
  intro F M τ t ht
  unfold truth_at
  intro h_box_phi σ hs s hs' hts
  have h_shifted_domain : (WorldHistory.time_shift σ (s - t)).domain t := by
    simp only [WorldHistory.time_shift]
    have : t + (s - t) = s := by omega
    rw [this]; exact hs'
  have h_phi_at_shifted := h_box_phi (WorldHistory.time_shift σ (s - t)) h_shifted_domain
  have h_preserve := TimeShift.time_shift_preserves_truth M σ t s h_shifted_domain hs' φ
  exact h_preserve.mp h_phi_at_shifted
```

#### Task 3A.5: TF Axiom Proof ✅ COMPLETE
**File**: `ProofChecker/Metalogic/Soundness.lean` (lines 452-475)

**What was done**:
Proved `temp_future_valid` using time-shift preservation (symmetric to MF).

**Key Achievement**: All 10 TM axioms now have validity lemmas!

#### Task 3A.6: Transport Lemmas ✅ COMPLETE (2025-12-03)
**File**: `ProofChecker/Semantics/WorldHistory.lean`

**Lemmas implemented**:

| Lemma | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `states_eq_of_time_eq` | States equal when times provably equal (proof irrelevance) |
| `time_shift_time_shift_states` | Double shift (Δ, -Δ) returns original states |
| `time_shift_congr` | Shifting by equal amounts gives equal histories |
| `time_shift_zero_domain_iff` | Domain unchanged by shift of 0 |
| `time_shift_time_shift_neg_domain_iff` | Double shift domain equals original |
| `time_shift_time_shift_neg_states` | Double shift states equal original |

#### Task 3A.7: Time-Shift Preservation Lemma ✅ COMPLETE (2025-12-03)
**File**: `ProofChecker/Semantics/Truth.lean`

**What was done**:
1. Added `truth_proof_irrel` - Truth independent of domain membership proof
2. Added `truth_history_eq` - Truth preserved under history equality
3. Added `truth_double_shift_cancel` - **Key lemma** for transporting truth across double time-shift
4. Completed all 6 cases of `time_shift_preserves_truth`:
   - **Atom**: Uses `states_eq_of_time_eq` with `x + (y - x) = y`
   - **Bot**: Trivial (both sides are `False`)
   - **Imp**: IH on both subformulas
   - **Box**: Uses `truth_double_shift_cancel` for backward direction
   - **Past**: Bijection between times via time arithmetic + `truth_proof_irrel`
   - **Future**: Symmetric to past case

**Sorry removed**: 4 (was 4, now 0 in Truth.lean)

### Sub-Phase 3B: Automation (Task 7) [DEFERRED]

Automation tactics are lower priority than completing soundness proofs.
See stage files for detailed plans when ready.

### Sub-Phase 3C: WorldHistory Fix (Task 8) ✅ DOCUMENTED

The `universal` constructor has a `sorry` because it requires reflexive frame property.
**Decision**: Document limitation and leave sorry (chosen option 2).

**Documentation in place**:
- Detailed docstring explaining frame constraint requirement
- Examples of reflexive vs non-reflexive frames
- Impact on semantics explained
- Future work options documented

## Technical Notes

### Dependent Type Challenges

The time-shift preservation proof involves dependent types that complicate proof transport:
- `truth_at M τ t ht φ` depends on `ht : τ.domain t`
- When shifting histories, domain proofs must be transported
- Lean's proof irrelevance helps but requires careful `convert` tactics

**Key Insight (2025-12-03)**: Lean 4 has proof irrelevance for `Prop`-valued types, so when
`t₁ = t₂` (as `Int`), then `ht₁ : σ.domain t₁` and `ht₂ : σ.domain t₂` are definitionally
equal after `subst`. This means `states_eq_of_time_eq` works with just `subst h; rfl`.

### Key Realization: truth_double_shift_cancel

The `truth_double_shift_cancel` lemma is more powerful than case-splitting on formula structure in the main theorem. It provides a general transport principle that handles all formula constructors uniformly via structural induction:

```lean
theorem truth_double_shift_cancel (M : TaskModel F) (σ : WorldHistory F) (Δ : Int) (t : Int)
    (ht : σ.domain t) (ht' : (WorldHistory.time_shift (WorldHistory.time_shift σ Δ) (-Δ)).domain t)
    (φ : Formula) :
    truth_at M (WorldHistory.time_shift (WorldHistory.time_shift σ Δ) (-Δ)) t ht' φ ↔
    truth_at M σ t ht φ
```

### Classical Logic in Conjunction Handling

The formula encoding `φ ∧ ψ := ¬(φ → ¬ψ)` requires classical reasoning to extract components.
The helper `and_of_not_imp_not` uses `Classical.byContradiction` for this.
