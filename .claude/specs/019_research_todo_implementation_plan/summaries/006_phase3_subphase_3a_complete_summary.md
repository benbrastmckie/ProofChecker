**Date**: 2025-12-02
**Iteration**: 1 (continuation)
**Phase**: Phase 3 Sub-Phase 3A (Wave 2 Soundness Documentation)
**Status**: COMPLETE

## Work Status

**Completion**: Sub-Phase 3A 100% (7/7 tasks complete)

**Overall Phase 3 Progress**: 1.5/3 sub-phases (50%)
- ✅ Sub-Phase 3C: WorldHistory Fix (completed in previous iteration)

## Executive Summary

Sub-Phase 3A (Conditional Soundness Documentation) is now complete. All TL, MF, and TF axioms have comprehensive conditional validity documentation with frame property requirements (BackwardPersistence, ModalTemporalPersistence). Paper cross-references have been added to all four semantic modules (TaskFrame, WorldHistory, Truth, Soundness), and temporal operator semantics have been verified to match the JPL paper specification exactly.

**Key Achievements**:
- ✅ Conditional validity documentation for TL, MF, TF axioms (Tasks 3A.2-3A.3)
- ✅ Paper cross-references added to 4 modules (Task 3A.6)
- ✅ Int simplification documented with abelian group correspondence (Task 3A.6)
- ✅ Temporal operator semantics verified to match paper (Task 3A.7)
- ✅ Option B (Conditional Validity) officially chosen and documented
- ✅ Clean builds maintained (only expected sorry warnings)
- ✅ MVP conditional validity approach fully implemented

## Completed Work Details

### Task 3A.2: Implement Option B Architecture (COMPLETE)

**Objective**: Choose and document Option B (Conditional Validity Documentation) approach

**Implementation**:
- Option B officially chosen and documented in Soundness.lean module docstring
- Rationale: Time-efficient (4-6 hours vs 12-18 hours for Option A), non-invasive, research-flexible
- Conditional validity approach applied consistently to TL, MF, TF axioms
- Frame properties defined but not enforced in TaskFrame structure

**Impact**: Pragmatic MVP approach that makes semantic assumptions explicit without invasive refactoring

### Task 3A.3: Document Conditional Validity for TL, MF, TF Axioms (COMPLETE)

**Objective**: Add comprehensive conditional validity documentation to axiom theorems

**Implementation**:

**TL Axiom** (`temp_l_valid`, line 309-349):
```lean
/--
TL axiom validity (conditional on backward persistence).

**Frame Constraint Required**: BackwardPersistence

The TL axiom `Fφ → F(Pφ)` is valid in task semantic models whose underlying
frames satisfy the backward persistence property.

**Backward Persistence Property**:
If φ holds at all times s ≥ t₂ in a history τ, then φ also holds at all
times r in the interval [t₁, t₂) within τ (for any t₁ < t₂).

**Justification**: The TL axiom relates future quantification to past
quantification at future times. Without backward persistence, φ can hold
from some future point onward without holding in the gap before that point.

**Impact on Soundness**: The soundness theorem holds for TL axiom derivations
*provided* the semantic models satisfy backward persistence.

**Future Work**: Option A (add to TaskFrame), Option C (weaken axiom), or
accept conditional soundness (current MVP approach).
-/
```

**MF Axiom** (`modal_future_valid`, line 369-406):
```lean
/--
MF axiom validity (conditional on modal-temporal persistence).

**Frame Constraint Required**: ModalTemporalPersistence

The MF axiom `□φ → □(Fφ)` is valid in task semantic models whose underlying
frames satisfy the modal-temporal persistence property.

**Modal-Temporal Persistence Property**:
If φ is necessarily true at time t (holds at all histories at t), then φ
remains necessarily true at all future times s > t (holds at all histories at s).

**Justification**: The MF axiom states that necessary truths remain necessary
in the future. From □φ (φ holds at all histories at time t), we need to show
□(Fφ) (for all histories σ, φ holds at all future times in σ).

**Impact on Soundness**: The soundness theorem holds for MF axiom derivations
*provided* the semantic models satisfy modal-temporal persistence.

**Future Work**: Option A (add to TaskFrame), Option C (weaken axiom), or
accept conditional soundness (current MVP approach).
-/
```

**TF Axiom** (`temp_future_valid`, line 408-444):
```lean
/--
TF axiom validity (conditional on modal-temporal persistence).

**Frame Constraint Required**: ModalTemporalPersistence

The TF axiom `□φ → F(□φ)` is valid in task semantic models whose underlying
frames satisfy the modal-temporal persistence property.

**Justification**: The TF axiom states that if φ is necessary at time t,
then at all future times s > t, φ remains necessary (F(□φ) means for all
future times s, □φ holds at s). This is a direct application of modal-temporal
persistence: necessary truths at t remain necessary at all future times.

**Impact on Soundness**: The soundness theorem holds for TF axiom derivations
*provided* the semantic models satisfy modal-temporal persistence.

**Future Work**: Option A (add to TaskFrame), Option C (weaken axiom), or
accept conditional soundness (current MVP approach).

```

**Files Modified**:
- `ProofChecker/Metalogic/Soundness.lean` (lines 309-444): Comprehensive conditional validity docstrings

**Impact**: All three conditional axioms now have clear frame requirements documented

---

### Task 3A.6: Add Paper Cross-References (COMPLETE)

**Objective**: Add JPL paper cross-references to TaskFrame, WorldHistory, Truth, Soundness modules

**Implementation**:

**TaskFrame.lean** (lines 1-47):
- Paper reference: `app:TaskSemantics, def:frame, line 1835`
- Documents paper's definition: `F = (W, G, ·)` where G is abelian group
- **Int Simplification**: Explicitly documented that `Int` with addition is a specific abelian group satisfying all paper requirements
- Alignment verification: Maps paper's nullity and compositionality to ProofChecker equivalents
- Cross-reference to paper's formal task frame definition

**WorldHistory.lean** (lines 1-44):
- Paper reference: `app:TaskSemantics, def:world-history, line 1849`
- Documents paper's definition: `τ: T → W` where `T ⊆ G` is convex subset
- Maps ProofChecker implementation to paper specification
- Critical semantic points: Box vs Past/Future quantification clarified
- Cross-reference to paper's formal world history definition

**Truth.lean** (lines 1-56):
- Paper reference: `app:TaskSemantics, def:BL-semantics, lines 1857-1866`
- Documents all 6 truth evaluation clauses from paper
- **Alignment verification**: Checkmarks (✓) for all 6 cases matching paper exactly
- **Task 3A.7 completion**: Temporal operator verification embedded here
- Cross-reference to paper's formal truth definition

**Soundness.lean** (lines 1-69):
- Paper reference: `app:valid, line 1984`
- Documents perpetuity principles P1/P2 proven in paper using time-shift automorphisms
- Notes ProofChecker extensions beyond paper (TL, MF, TF conditional axioms)
- Proven axioms aligned with paper's S5 modal and linear temporal components
- Cross-reference to paper's perpetuity principle validity proofs

**Files Modified**:
- `ProofChecker/Semantics/TaskFrame.lean` (lines 1-47)
- `ProofChecker/Semantics/WorldHistory.lean` (lines 1-44)
- `ProofChecker/Semantics/Truth.lean` (lines 1-56)
- `ProofChecker/Metalogic/Soundness.lean` (lines 1-69)

**Impact**: All semantic modules now have explicit paper cross-references for verification

---

### Task 3A.7: Verify Temporal Operator Semantics (COMPLETE)

**Objective**: Verify ProofChecker's temporal operators match JPL paper specification

**Verification Result**: ✅ **EXACT MATCH CONFIRMED**

**Paper Specification** (def:BL-semantics, lines 1864-1866):
```latex
M,τ,x ⊨ Past φ  iff  M,τ,y ⊨ φ for all y ∈ T where y < x
M,τ,x ⊨ Future φ  iff  M,τ,y ⊨ φ for all y ∈ T where x < y
```

**ProofChecker Implementation** (Truth.lean, lines 64-65):
```lean
| Formula.past φ => ∀ (s : Int) (hs : τ.domain s), s < t → truth_at M τ s hs φ
| Formula.future φ => ∀ (s : Int) (hs : τ.domain s), t < s → truth_at M τ s hs φ
```

**Critical Verification Points**:
1. ✅ Quantification restricts to `s ∈ τ.domain` (history's time domain)
2. ✅ Past: `s < t` matches paper's `y < x`
3. ✅ Future: `t < s` matches paper's `x < y`
4. ✅ Domain restriction `(hs : τ.domain s)` matches paper's `y ∈ T`

**Conclusion**: ProofChecker temporal operators are semantically correct per JPL paper

**Documentation**: Verification documented in Truth.lean module docstring (lines 29-32)

**Impact**: Confirms ProofChecker's temporal semantics are faithful to paper specification

## Next Steps

### Immediate Work Remaining (Phase 3)

**Sub-Phase 3B: Core Automation** (29-42 hours):
- Phase 1: apply_axiom and modal_t tactics (10-13 hours)
- Phase 2: tm_auto with Aesop integration (12-15 hours)
- Phase 3: assumption_search and helpers (7-14 hours)

**Documentation** (from spec 022):
- METAPROGRAMMING_GUIDE.md provides LEAN 4 tactic API reference
- TACTIC_DEVELOPMENT.md Section 2.5 has working modal_t example
- TACTIC_DEVELOPMENT.md Section 4 has Aesop integration patterns
- Expected time savings: 11-18 hours vs original 40-60 hour estimate

### Documentation Updates Needed

After completing Sub-Phase 3B:
- [ ] Update TODO.md: Mark Task 5 complete, update Task 7 progress
- [ ] Update IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md: Soundness 60% → 80% (conditional), Automation 0% → 40%
- [ ] Update KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md: Document conditional soundness, frame property requirements
- [ ] Create Phase 3 complete summary after Sub-Phase 3B

## Context Management

**Current Context Usage**: ~36% (72K/200K tokens)
- Previous iteration partial summary: ~47K tokens consumed
- This iteration Sub-Phase 3A completion: ~25K tokens consumed
- Total cumulative: ~72K tokens
- Remaining capacity: ~128K tokens (64%)

**Context Sufficient For**:
- ✅ Sub-Phase 3B Phase 1 (apply_axiom + modal_t, 10-13 hours)
- ⚠️ Sub-Phase 3B Phase 2 (tm_auto, 12-15 hours) - may need continuation
- ❌ Sub-Phase 3B Phase 3 (assumption_search, 7-14 hours) - likely requires continuation

**Recommendation**:
- Continue with Sub-Phase 3B Phase 1 in this iteration
- Create checkpoint before Phase 2 if context approaches 85%
- Use continuation mechanism for Phase 3 if needed

## Conclusion

Sub-Phase 3A (Conditional Soundness Documentation) is fully complete with all 7 tasks accomplished. The conditional validity approach has been successfully applied to TL, MF, and TF axioms with comprehensive frame property documentation. Paper cross-references have been added to all four semantic modules (TaskFrame, WorldHistory, Truth, Soundness), the Int simplification has been documented with abelian group correspondence, and temporal operator semantics have been verified to exactly match the JPL paper specification.

**Ready for**: Sub-Phase 3B (Core Automation, 29-42 hours)

**Quality**: High-quality documentation-first approach with clean builds, comprehensive explanations, and explicit paper alignment verification.

**Context**: 36% usage, sufficient for at least 1 more sub-phase iteration before continuation needed.
