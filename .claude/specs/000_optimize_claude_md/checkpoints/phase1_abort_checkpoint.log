=== PHASE 1 CHECKPOINT: ABORT CRITERIA TRIGGERED ===
Date: $(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
Status: ABORT - Plan revision required

BASELINE SIZES:
- code-standards.md: 465 lines (ALREADY EXCEEDS 400 threshold)
- testing-protocols.md: 324 lines (within threshold)
- documentation-standards.md: 464 lines (ALREADY EXCEEDS 400 threshold)

PROJECTED POST-MERGE SIZES:
- code-standards.md: 516 lines (projected +51 lines) → EXCEEDS threshold
- testing-protocols.md: 372 lines (projected +48 lines) → within threshold
- documentation-standards.md: 469 lines (projected +5 lines) → EXCEEDS threshold

ABORT REASON:
Per Phase 1 Abort Criteria: "If ANY projected size >400 lines, STOP and revise plan with split strategy"

Two files ALREADY exceed the 400-line threshold BEFORE any merge operations:
1. code-standards.md: 465 lines (already 16% over threshold)
2. documentation-standards.md: 464 lines (already 16% over threshold)

CRITICAL FINDING:
The original plan assumed target files would be ~100-150 lines. However, they are already 464-465 lines.
Merging additional content would create bloated files (469-516 lines), violating the plan's own bloat prevention goals.

BACKUP CREATED:
/home/benjamin/Documents/Philosophy/Projects/ProofChecker/.claude/backups/CLAUDE.md.20251201-135232

RECOMMENDATION:
Revise implementation strategy to:
1. SKIP merge operations (Phases 2-4) entirely
2. ONLY replace CLAUDE.md sections with summary + link format (Phases 5-8)
3. Add cross-references without modifying bloated files (Phase 8)
4. Document why merge strategy is inappropriate for already-bloated files
