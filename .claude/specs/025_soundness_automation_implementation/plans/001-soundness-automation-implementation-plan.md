# Soundness and Automation Implementation Plan

## Metadata
- **Date**: 2025-12-03 (Revised: 2025-12-03)
- **Feature**: Complete soundness proofs and implement core automation tactics for TM bimodal logic
- **Status**: [NOT STARTED]
- **Estimated Hours**: 70-105 hours
- **Complexity Score**: 180
- **Structure Level**: 0
- **Standards File**: /home/benjamin/Documents/Philosophy/Projects/ProofChecker/CLAUDE.md
- **Research Reports**:
  - [Soundness Automation Research](../reports/001-soundness-automation-implementation-research.md)

## Overview

This implementation plan covers four high/medium-priority tasks from ProofChecker TODO.md:

1. **Task 5**: Fix Modal K and Temporal K Rule Implementations (CRITICAL - code-paper alignment)
2. **Task 5b**: Complete Temporal Duality Soundness
3. **Task 7**: Implement Core Automation - 4 tactics (apply_axiom, modal_t, tm_auto, assumption_search)
4. **Task 12**: Create Comprehensive Tactic Test Suite (concurrent with Task 7)

### Critical Issue Discovered

**The Modal K and Temporal K rules are implemented in the WRONG DIRECTION from the paper!**

- **Paper MK** (line 1030): If `Γ ⊢ φ`, then `□Γ ⊢ □φ`
- **Paper TK** (line 1037): If `Γ ⊢ φ`, then `FΓ ⊢ Fφ`
- **Current Code**: Rules are reversed - this must be fixed BEFORE proving soundness

## Research Summary

Key findings from research report:
- Modal K and Temporal K rules in Derivation.lean (lines 90-102) do not match paper definitions
- Current implementation: `□Γ ⊢ φ → Γ ⊢ □φ` (wrong direction)
- Paper definition: `Γ ⊢ φ → □Γ ⊢ □φ` (correct direction)
- After fixing rules, soundness proofs become straightforward with no restrictions
- Temporal duality requires symmetric frame assumption (documented limitation)
- Automation tactics are currently stubs only - full implementation required

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Modal K rule in Derivation.lean matches paper definition (line 1030)
- [ ] Temporal K rule in Derivation.lean matches paper definition (line 1037)
- [ ] All soundness proofs compile with zero `sorry` in rule cases
- [ ] Temporal duality soundness documented with symmetric frame restriction
- [ ] 4 core tactics implemented: apply_axiom, modal_t, tm_auto, assumption_search
- [ ] TMLogic Aesop rule set declared with axiom/perpetuity rules
- [ ] Comprehensive test suite with ≥50 tests for automation package
- [ ] All tests pass with `lake test`
- [ ] Documentation updated (IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md, KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md)
- [ ] `lake build` succeeds with zero warnings

## Technical Design

### Architecture Overview

**Phase 0 (Rule Fix)**: Modify `ProofChecker/ProofSystem/Derivation.lean` to fix rule directions:
- Change modal_k: `Derivable Γ φ → Derivable (Γ.map box) (box φ)`
- Change temporal_k: `Derivable Γ φ → Derivable (Γ.map future) (future φ)`

**Phases 1-3 (Soundness)**: Update `ProofChecker/Metalogic/Soundness.lean`:
- After rule fix, soundness proofs use standard modal logic techniques
- Modal K: If `Γ ⊨ φ` then `□Γ ⊨ □φ` (direct from semantics)
- Temporal K: If `Γ ⊨ φ` then `FΓ ⊨ Fφ` (parallel structure)
- Temporal Duality: Requires symmetric frame constraint (documented restriction)

**Phases 4-6 (Automation)**: Replace stubs in `ProofChecker/Automation/Tactics.lean`:
- apply_axiom: Macro-based axiom application
- modal_t: elab_rules pattern-matched tactic
- tm_auto: Aesop integration with TMLogic rule set
- assumption_search: TacticM with context iteration

### Component Interactions

```
Derivation.lean (rules) → Soundness.lean (proofs) → Tactics.lean (automation)
                                                  ↓
                                            TacticsTest.lean (tests)
```

### Key Dependencies
- Phase 0 must complete before Phases 1-3 (rule fix enables correct soundness proofs)
- Phases 4-7 can run in parallel with Phases 1-3
- Phase 8 depends on all other phases completing

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Each tactic has dedicated unit tests in TacticsTest.lean
- Test correct behavior for valid inputs
- Test error messages for invalid inputs
- Test edge cases (empty context, nested formulas)

### Integration Testing
- Test tactic combinations (modal_t + assumption_search)
- Test tm_auto with complex proof goals
- Test soundness theorems with implemented tactics

### Performance Testing
- Verify tm_auto completes within reasonable time (< 1 second per goal)
- Test deeply nested formulas (depth 5+)
- Benchmark Aesop search depth limits

### Regression Testing
- All existing tests must continue passing
- Run full test suite after each phase completion

## Documentation Requirements

### Files to Update
1. **IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md**: Update Soundness (→ 100%) and Automation (→ 40%) status
2. **KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md**: Remove code-paper alignment warnings, add frame restrictions
3. **TACTIC_DEVELOPMENT.md**: Add implemented tactic examples and usage patterns
4. **TODO.md**: Mark Tasks 5, 5b, 7, 12 as complete with dates
5. **CLAUDE.md**: Update overview sections for Metalogic and Automation packages

### Documentation Standards
- All docstrings follow LEAN_STYLE_GUIDE.md format
- Paper references include line numbers (e.g., "line 1030")
- Verification commands provided for each claim

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- Aesop library (for tm_auto integration)
- LEAN 4 metaprogramming API (Lean.Elab.Tactic, Lean.Meta)

### Internal Dependencies
- Phase 0 must complete before Phases 1-3 (rule fix enables soundness proofs)
- Phase 4 must complete before Phase 5 (Aesop builds on basic tactics)
- Phase 8 depends on all previous phases (documentation sync)

### Parallel Execution
- Phases 1, 2, 3 can run in parallel (after Phase 0)
- Phases 4, 5, 6, 7 can run in parallel with Phases 1-3
- Optimal with 2 developers: one on soundness track (0→1→2→3→8), one on automation track (4→5→6→7)
