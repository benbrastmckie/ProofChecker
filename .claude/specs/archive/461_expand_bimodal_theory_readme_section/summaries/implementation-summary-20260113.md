# Implementation Summary: Task #461

**Completed**: 2026-01-13
**Duration**: ~10 minutes

## Changes Made

Expanded the Bimodal Theory section in README.md from ~80 words to ~260 words, explaining:

1. **Time-possibility relationship**: Bimodal captures the philosophical insight that the present opens onto multiple possible futures sharing a common past
2. **Perpetuity principles**: P1-P6 formalize the relationship between necessity and perpetuity
3. **Methodology testbed**: Bimodal validates the formal methodology at simpler complexity before scaling to Logos
4. **Transfer patterns**: Task semantics, proof architecture, and automation strategies transfer directly to Logos

## Files Modified

- `README.md` - Lines 163-175 (Bimodal Theory section expanded)

## Section Content (Final)

The expanded section now includes:
- Para 1: Time-possibility relationship and perpetuity principles
- Para 2: Methodology testbed purpose (simpler → complex validation)
- Para 3: What transfers to Logos (task semantics, proof patterns, automation)
- Para 4: Intensional vs hyperintensional contrast (preserved from original)
- Links: Both original documentation links preserved

## Verification

- Word count: ~260 words (target: 250-300)
- All three key concepts covered
- Original links preserved
- Markdown formatting correct
- Section reads naturally in README context

## Notes

The expansion successfully explains the strategic purpose of Bimodal as the logical core of the Logos methodology, not just a "comparison baseline" but a well-motivated development target for validating the formal methodology before scaling to hyperintensional complexity.
