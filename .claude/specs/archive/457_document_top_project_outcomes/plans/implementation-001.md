# Implementation Plan: Task #457

**Task**: Document top 2-3 project outcomes for grant reporting
**Version**: 001
**Created**: 2026-01-13
**Language**: general

## Overview

Create grant report text following the provided example format, distilling the three major project outcomes identified in research-001.md into concise, impact-focused bullet points.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Prepare Grant Report Text

**Estimated effort**: 30 minutes
**Status**: [NOT STARTED]

**Objectives**:
1. Draft 2-3 outcome bullet points following the example format provided
2. Focus on: what was built, impact/results, and learnings/next steps

**Example Format Reference**:
```
1) Developed the MVP for an AI tutor that explains complex math proofs step-by-step...
2) Early tests with 30 learners showed a 25% increase in concept retention...
3) Identified improvement areas via feedback, including adaptive pacing...
```

**Deliverable**: Grant report text with 2-3 outcome bullet points

**Steps**:

1. **Draft Outcome 1**: Technical achievement
   - What: First Lean 4 formalization of TM bimodal logic with machine-verified soundness, deduction theorem, and decidability proofs
   - Impact: Provides verified foundation for AI reasoning systems

2. **Draft Outcome 2**: Theoretical contribution
   - What: Hyperintensional semantic framework based on exact truthmaker theory
   - Impact: Enables fine-grained propositional distinctions beyond classical logic

3. **Draft Outcome 3**: Practical methodology
   - What: Dual verification architecture for AI training data generation
   - Impact: Unlimited verified training data with mathematical guarantees

**Verification**:
- Text matches example format (numbered bullet points, ~1-2 sentences each)
- Covers outcomes, impact, and forward-looking elements

## Recommended Output

Based on research findings, here is the grant report text matching the requested format:

**Option A (3 outcomes):**

1) Developed the first Lean 4 formalization of TM bimodal logic with machine-verified soundness proofs for all 14 axiom schemas, the deduction theorem, and 6 perpetuity principles - establishing a verified foundation for AI temporal-modal reasoning.

2) Created a hyperintensional semantic framework based on exact truthmaker theory with a layered architecture supporting modal, temporal, epistemic, and metacognitive reasoning - enabling AI systems to make fine-grained propositional distinctions impossible with classical logic.

3) Established a dual verification methodology combining Lean proof generation (positive signals) with Z3 countermodel extraction (corrective signals) to produce unlimited self-supervised training data with mathematical guarantees - addressing the scalability limitations of human annotation for AI reasoning.

**Option B (2 outcomes, more condensed):**

1) Completed the first machine-verified formalization of TM bimodal logic in Lean 4, proving soundness for all 14 axiom schemas and implementing a hyperintensional semantic framework based on exact truthmaker theory - providing a verified foundation for trustworthy AI reasoning systems.

2) Developed a dual verification architecture combining Lean 4 proof generation with Z3-based countermodel extraction to produce unlimited, provably correct training data for AI systems - enabling scalable self-supervised learning for logical reasoning beyond human annotation limits.
