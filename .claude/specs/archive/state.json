Current chain construction (Strategy C) provides coherence for discrete ℤ-indexed positions but cannot extend to full Duration domain. Investigate Strategy A from research-002.md: strengthen canonical_task_rel to include persistence conditions, making compositionality provable by construction. Also consider: (1) proving Duration discreteness (≅ ℤ·chain_step), (2) modifying forward/backward_extension to return chain-coherent witnesses, (3) quotient-based approaches.",
