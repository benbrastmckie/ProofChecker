## Overview

The ProofChecker project has completed 8 major implementation phases delivering a functional TM bimodal logic proof system. However, documentation contains significant gaps and inaccuracies compared to actual implementation. This plan addresses critical documentation issues identified through comprehensive codebase analysis, ensuring users have accurate information about what's implemented versus planned.

**Key Problems**:
1. README/CLAUDE.md claim "Complete Metalogic" but soundness has 6 `sorry` placeholders
2. Completeness infrastructure confused with actual proofs
3. Tutorial/Examples reference unimplemented tactics (modal_t, modal_search, tm_auto)
4. Perpetuity P4-P6 partial implementation not documented
5. No central tracking of implementation status

**Solution Approach**: Create missing status documentation first, then systematically update all user-facing documentation with accurate implementation details and appropriate warnings for unimplemented features.

## Research Summary

The documentation coverage analysis identified:

1. **Critical Gaps**:
   - "Complete Metalogic" claims contradict reality (soundness 5/8 axioms, 4/7 rules proven)
   - Completeness uses `axiom` keyword (infrastructure only, no proofs)
   - Tutorial references non-existent tactics
   - Perpetuity P4-P6 use `sorry` but docs don't mention this

2. **Accurate Sections**:
   - Source-level docstrings in Formula.lean, Axioms.lean are excellent
   - Project structure in README/CLAUDE.md matches reality
   - Operator definitions and axiom lists are accurate

3. **Recommended Approach**:
   - Phase 1: Create IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md and KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md
   - Phase 2-4: Update README.md, CLAUDE.md, ARCHITECTURE.md with accurate status
   - Phase 5-6: Add warnings to Tutorial/Examples for unimplemented features
   - Phase 7: Validation and cross-reference verification

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All "Complete Metalogic" claims updated to reflect partial implementation
- [ ] IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md created with module-by-module tracking
- [ ] KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md created documenting all gaps and workarounds
- [ ] README.md has Implementation Status section showing completed vs partial vs planned
- [ ] CLAUDE.md updated with accurate metalogic package descriptions
- [ ] ARCHITECTURE.md sections tagged with implementation status
- [ ] TUTORIAL.md has warnings before unimplemented feature sections
- [ ] EXAMPLES.md marks examples requiring unimplemented features
- [ ] All documentation cross-references validated
- [ ] Zero broken links in documentation
- [ ] Consistency between all documentation files

## Technical Design

### Architecture

This is a pure documentation update with no code changes. Architecture focuses on documentation organization and consistency:

**Documentation Hierarchy**:
```
README.md (user entry point)
  ├─> IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md (new: detailed status tracking)
  ├─> KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md (new: gaps and workarounds)
  ├─> docs/ARCHITECTURE.md (updated: status tags on sections)
  ├─> docs/TUTORIAL.md (updated: warnings for unimplemented features)
  └─> docs/EXAMPLES.md (updated: status tags on examples)

CLAUDE.md (developer entry point)
  ├─> IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md (same as above)
  ├─> KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md (same as above)
  └─> Project structure sections (updated descriptions)
```

**Status Tag System** (for ARCHITECTURE.md):
- `[IMPLEMENTED]` - Fully working with tests
- `[PARTIAL]` - Working but incomplete (e.g., soundness 5/8 axioms)
- `[INFRASTRUCTURE]` - Type signatures only, no proofs
- `[PLANNED]` - Future work (Layer 1/2/3 extensions)

**Warning Box Format** (for Tutorial/Examples):
```markdown
> **⚠️ Future Feature**: The [feature name] shown below is planned but not yet implemented.
> See [IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md](../IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md) for current status.
```

### File Modification Strategy

**New Files**:
1. `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` - Module-by-module status with sorry counts
2. `docs/KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md` - Documented gaps with explanations and workarounds

**Updated Files**:
1. `README.md` - Add Implementation Status section after Features
2. `CLAUDE.md` - Update Project Overview and Key Packages sections
3. `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` - Add status tags to all major sections
4. `docs/TUTORIAL.md` - Add warning boxes before unimplemented features
5. `docs/EXAMPLES.md` - Mark examples requiring unimplemented features

### Standards Compliance

Following CLAUDE.md documentation standards:
- **Formal Symbol Backtick Standard**: All Unicode symbols (□, ◇, △, ▽) in backticks
- **Documentation Policy**: Update existing docs, avoid creating unnecessary new files (only 2 new files needed)
- **Accuracy Requirement**: All claims about implementation must be verifiable in source
- **User-Facing Warnings**: Clear warnings before any unimplemented feature examples

```

**Expected Duration**: 1 hour

## Testing Strategy

### Documentation Verification Approach

Since this is a pure documentation update, testing focuses on accuracy, consistency, and completeness:

**1. Accuracy Testing**:
- Every claim about implementation status must be verifiable in source code
- Cross-reference documentation claims against actual source file contents
- Verify sorry counts match actual occurrences in Metalogic/ and Theorems/

**2. Consistency Testing**:
- Same features described identically across all documentation files
- Status terminology used consistently (Implemented, Partial, Infrastructure, Planned)
- Cross-references between documents all valid

**3. Completeness Testing**:
- All critical gaps from research report addressed
- All recommendations R1-R6 implemented
- No broken links in documentation

**4. User Experience Testing**:
- New users can find implementation status easily
- Warnings appear before all unimplemented feature examples
- Clear guidance on what works vs. what doesn't

### Test Commands

```bash
# Verify all new documentation exists
test -f docs/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md || echo "ERROR: IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md missing"
test -f docs/KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md || echo "ERROR: KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md missing"

# Verify no "Complete Metalogic" false claims
if grep -r "Complete Metalogic" README.md CLAUDE.md docs/ARCHITECTURE.md; then
  echo "ERROR: False 'Complete Metalogic' claims still present"
  exit 1
fi

# Verify Implementation Status sections added
grep -q "## Implementation Status" README.md || echo "ERROR: README missing Implementation Status"
grep -q "## Implementation Status" CLAUDE.md || echo "ERROR: CLAUDE.md missing Implementation Status"

# Verify warnings added to Tutorial/Examples
grep -q "⚠️" docs/TUTORIAL.md || echo "ERROR: TUTORIAL.md missing warnings"
grep -q "⚠️" docs/EXAMPLES.md || echo "ERROR: EXAMPLES.md missing warnings"

# Count sorry occurrences and compare to documentation
SOUNDNESS_SORRY=$(grep -c "sorry" ProofChecker/Metalogic/Soundness.lean || echo 0)
echo "Soundness sorry count: $SOUNDNESS_SORRY (should be 6)"

PERPETUITY_SORRY=$(grep -c "sorry" ProofChecker/Theorems/Perpetuity.lean || echo 0)
echo "Perpetuity sorry count: $PERPETUITY_SORRY (should be 3-6 for P4-P6)"

# Verify links to new docs
grep -q "IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md" README.md || echo "ERROR: README doesn't link to IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md"
grep -q "KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md" README.md || echo "ERROR: README doesn't link to KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md"

# Verify status tag consistency
grep "\[PARTIAL\]" docs/ARCHITECTURE.md | wc -l
grep "\[INFRASTRUCTURE ONLY\]" docs/ARCHITECTURE.md | wc -l
grep "\[PLANNED\]" docs/ARCHITECTURE.md | wc -l

echo "✓ All documentation verification tests completed"
```

## Documentation Requirements

All updated documentation must follow CLAUDE.md standards:

### Formal Symbol Backtick Standard
- All Unicode symbols must be in backticks: `□`, `◇`, `△`, `▽`, `⊢`, `⊨`
- Exception: When in code blocks, backticks not required

### Documentation Update Standards
- Update existing docs rather than creating new (only 2 new files: IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md, KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md)
- Cross-reference all documentation (bidirectional links)
- Maintain consistency across all files
- Clear warnings before all unimplemented features

### Files to Update
- README.md - Add Implementation Status section, update Features
- CLAUDE.md - Add Implementation Status section, update Key Packages
- docs/ARCHITECTURE.md - Add status tags to all major sections
- docs/TUTORIAL.md - Add warnings before unimplemented features
- docs/EXAMPLES.md - Add status tags to examples

### Files to Create
- docs/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md - Module-by-module status tracking
- docs/KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md - Gaps, explanations, workarounds

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
- None - This is pure documentation work, no code dependencies

### External Dependencies
- None - No external tools required

### Documentation Dependencies
- Access to source files for verification:
  - ProofChecker/Metalogic/Soundness.lean (verify sorry count)
  - ProofChecker/Metalogic/Completeness.lean (verify axiom usage)
  - ProofChecker/Theorems/Perpetuity.lean (verify P4-P6 sorry)
  - ProofChecker/Automation/Tactics.lean (verify stub status)

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- Documentation-only changes, no code modifications
- All changes are additions or clarifications, not removals
- Existing accurate sections preserved unchanged

### Mitigation Strategies
- Phase 1-2: Create new docs first (IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md, KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md) before modifying existing
- Phase 3-6: Update existing docs with careful preservation of accurate content
- Phase 7: Comprehensive validation ensures no regressions or inconsistencies

### Rollback Plan
- All documentation changes tracked via git
- Can revert individual files if issues found
- No build/test infrastructure affected
