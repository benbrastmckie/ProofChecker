## Key Decisions and Notes

### Design Decisions
1. **Comprehensive Phase 1 Approach**: Instead of creating minimal structure in Phase 1 and populating in later phases, I created the fully-populated TODO.md in Phase 1. This approach:
   - Reduces total implementation time
   - Ensures consistency across all sections
   - Avoids redundant file writes
   - Maintains single source of truth

2. **Effort Estimates**: All effort estimates preserved from research report for accuracy and traceability.

3. **Dependency Graph**: Included both dependency relationships AND execution waves with parallelization analysis for optimal task scheduling.

4. **Sorry Registry Detail Level**: Each sorry entry includes file, line, context, resolution approach, effort estimate, and cross-reference to related task.

5. **Cross-References**: Extensive linking to IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md, KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md, and ARCHITECTURE.md for users who need deeper detail.

### Implementation Notes
- The TODO.md serves as the **central task tracking system** as specified
- All data sourced from research report 001-repository-state-analysis.md
- File format follows Markdown standards with consistent header levels
- Task numbering matches priority and logical grouping
- Progress tracking section designed for manual updates by developers

### Future Maintenance
- Users should update TODO.md when completing tasks (see "How to Update This File" section)
- Completion log should be updated with date stamps
- Status summary percentages should be recalculated after each task completion
- Sorry registry entries should be removed as placeholders are resolved
- Missing files section should be updated as files are created

## Work Remaining

**Status**: 0 phases remaining (100% complete)

All 5 implementation phases completed successfully:
- Phase 1: Create TODO.md Structure ✓
- Phase 2: Populate High Priority Tasks ✓
- Phase 3: Populate Medium Priority Tasks ✓
- Phase 4: Populate Low Priority and Future Work ✓
- Phase 5: Add Tracking Sections ✓

No additional work required for this implementation plan.

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Next Steps
1. Review TODO.md to familiarize with task organization
2. Start with High Priority tasks (especially Task 1: Fix CI Flags - only 1-2 hours)
3. Consider Task 2 (Add Propositional Axioms) as it unblocks Task 6
4. Tasks 1, 2, 3 can be executed in parallel (all independent)

### Documentation Updates
Consider updating CLAUDE.md to reference TODO.md:
- Add line in "Project Structure" section after README.md
- Format: `├── TODO.md                    # Systematic task tracking and priority management`

Consider updating README.md:
- Add reference in "Development Status" or "Contributing" section
- Format: "See [TODO.md](TODO.md) for systematic task tracking and development priorities"

### Long-Term Planning
- Use TODO.md as basis for sprint planning
- Track completion velocity to refine effort estimates
- Update quarterly as Layer 0 approaches completion
- Use as input for Layer 1/2/3 planning

---

## Context and Continuation

**Context Usage**: ~30% (58,000 / 200,000 tokens)
- Low usage, well within limits
- No continuation required
- All phases completed in single iteration

**Context Exhausted**: No

**Requires Continuation**: No

## Success Criteria Verification

From plan success criteria (lines 62-71):

- ✓ TODO.md file created at `/home/benjamin/Documents/Philosophy/Projects/ProofChecker/TODO.md`
- ✓ File contains all 41 `sorry` placeholders with line references and resolution approaches
- ✓ Tasks organized by priority levels (High/Medium/Low) matching research recommendations
- ✓ Dependency graph section shows task ordering and prerequisites
- ✓ Missing files section lists 3 identified gaps with creation plans
- ✓ Cross-references to IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md and KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md for detailed tracking
- ✓ CI technical debt section documents 4 continue-on-error locations requiring audit
- ✓ Effort estimates included from research analysis (total 155-215 hours) [Note: Updated to 223-333 hours including low priority]
- ✓ File is actionable (specific file paths, line numbers, concrete next steps)

**Result**: All 9 success criteria met ✓

## Summary

This implementation successfully created a comprehensive TODO.md file at the ProofChecker project root. The file serves as the central task tracking system, organizing 11 tasks by priority, documenting 41 `sorry` placeholders, tracking 3 missing files, and providing execution guidance through dependency graphs and effort estimates.

The implementation was completed efficiently in a single iteration with all 5 phases executed successfully. The deliverable is production-ready and immediately actionable for ProofChecker development.

**Status**: COMPLETE
**Phases**: 5/5 (100%)
**Deliverables**: 1/1 (TODO.md created and validated)
**Quality**: All success criteria met
**Next Steps**: Begin executing tasks starting with High Priority items
