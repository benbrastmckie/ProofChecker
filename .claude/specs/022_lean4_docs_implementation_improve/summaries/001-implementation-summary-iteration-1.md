```bash
# Verify all cross-references between documentation files are valid
for file in Documentation/Development/TACTIC_DEVELOPMENT.md \
            Documentation/Development/METAPROGRAMMING_GUIDE.md \
            Documentation/Development/PHASED_IMPLEMENTATION.md \

  echo "Checking $file for broken references..."
  # Extract markdown links and verify local files exist
done
```

**Formal Symbol Backtick Compliance** (all modified/created files):

```bash
for file in Documentation/Development/TACTIC_DEVELOPMENT.md \
            Documentation/Development/METAPROGRAMMING_GUIDE.md \
            Documentation/Development/PHASED_IMPLEMENTATION.md \
            CLAUDE.md; do
  UNBACKTICKED=$(grep -E "□|◇|△|▽|⊢|⊨" "$file" | grep -v '`' | wc -l)
  if [ "$UNBACKTICKED" -gt 0 ]; then
    echo "FAIL: $file has $UNBACKTICKED unbackticked formal symbols"
  else
    echo "PASS: $file formal symbol backtick compliance"
  fi
done
```

## Key Decisions and Notes

**Decision 1**: Section Numbering in TACTIC_DEVELOPMENT.md
- Added new Sections 2.5, 4, and 5
- Renumbered existing sections to maintain logical flow
- Old Section 4 (Syntax Macros) became Section 6
- Old Sections 5-8 became Sections 7-10

**Decision 2**: Line Limit Compliance in CLAUDE.md
- Fixed newly added content to comply with 100-char line limit
- Pre-existing violations (lines 8, 9, 10, 11, 18, 19, etc.) remain
- Comprehensive line limit fix deferred to avoid scope expansion
- All Phase 4 additions (lines 269-337) are compliant

**Decision 3**: Phased Approach for Remaining Work
- Phases 5-7 are straightforward documentation updates (4-6 hours total)
- Can be completed in a single continuation session
- No complex implementation or research required
- All guidance and content already specified in plan

**Decision 4**: Summary Creation at 57% Completion
- Created summary at Phase 4 completion (57% done)
- Remaining work is low-risk documentation updates
- Summary provides clear continuation path for Phases 5-7

## Continuation Instructions

To complete the remaining phases:

1. **Phase 5** (1-2 hours): Update TODO.md
   - Add Tasks 12 and 13 as specified in plan lines 407-439
   - Update Dependency Graph and Status Summary

2. **Phase 6** (2-3 hours): Create DOC_QUALITY_CHECKLIST.md
   - Follow plan lines 471-515 for structure
   - Include all 5 check categories and usage guidance

3. **Phase 7** (1 hour): Update Documentation/README.md
   - Add new guides to Development/ section and Quick Links
   - Follow plan lines 526-556 for exact entries

4. **Final Verification**: Run integration tests
   - Cross-reference validation
   - Formal symbol backtick compliance check
   - Success criteria verification (plan lines 40-50)

**Total Time to Complete**: 4-6 hours
