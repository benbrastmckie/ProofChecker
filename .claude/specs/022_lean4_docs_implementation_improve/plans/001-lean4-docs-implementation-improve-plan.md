## Overview

This plan systematically improves ProofChecker's documentation infrastructure by addressing critical gaps in tactic development guidance, metaprogramming resources, and implementation roadmap clarity identified through comprehensive analysis of LEAN 4 modal logic best practices (report 021). While existing documentation provides solid TM logic architecture and status tracking, it lacks concrete metaprogramming examples, Aesop integration patterns, and phased implementation strategies essential for completing the 0%-complete automation package. Key improvements include expanding TACTIC_DEVELOPMENT.md with Lean.Elab.Tactic examples, creating new METAPROGRAMMING_GUIDE.md for systematic tactic implementation patterns, adding PHASED_IMPLEMENTATION.md for Wave 1-4 execution strategy, streamlining CLAUDE.md references to consolidate LEAN 4 guidance, and updating TODO.md with 2 new tasks derived from best practices recommendations. These enhancements will accelerate automation implementation from 0% to 40-50% completion within 40-60 hours by providing developers with concrete, actionable guidance that eliminates external research dependencies.

## Research Summary

The best practices report (021) and documentation improvement analysis (022) reveal three critical documentation gaps blocking automation implementation:

**1. Insufficient Tactic Development Guidance**: TACTIC_DEVELOPMENT.md provides basic elab syntax but lacks complete working examples using Lean.Elab.Tactic API, Aesop integration patterns, and simp lemma design (report 021 lines 254-377). Without concrete metaprogramming examples, developers implementing Task 7 (40-60 hours) face increased implementation time and error risk.

**2. Missing Metaprogramming Resource Guide**: No systematic coverage of Lean.Meta operations, expression manipulation, or proof term construction exists. Report 021 identifies key modules (Lean.Elab.Tactic, Lean.Meta, Lean.Expr, Lean.MVarId) and three development approaches (macro-based, elab_rules, direct TacticM) that should be documented (lines 254-299). Task 7 requires implementing 4 core tactics (apply_axiom, modal_t, tm_auto, assumption_search) but developers lack systematic metaprogramming reference.

**3. No Phased Implementation Roadmap**: While TODO.md lists tasks with dependencies, no dedicated guide shows Wave 1-4 execution strategy, parallel task opportunities, and critical path analysis. Report 021 provides 6 prioritized recommendations with effort estimates (lines 479-675), but these aren't translated into an actionable phased roadmap. Without phased guidance, developers may tackle tasks in suboptimal order, missing parallelization opportunities that could reduce time by 25-32%.

**Key Recommendations Implemented**:
- Recommendation 1: Expand TACTIC_DEVELOPMENT.md with Lean.Elab.Tactic examples and Aesop integration (8-12 hours)
- Recommendation 2: Create METAPROGRAMMING_GUIDE.md for tactic development fundamentals (6-10 hours)
- Recommendation 3: Create PHASED_IMPLEMENTATION.md for execution wave strategy (4-6 hours)
- Recommendation 4: Streamline CLAUDE.md with consolidated LEAN 4 quick reference (2-3 hours)
- Recommendation 5: Update TODO.md with 2 new tasks from best practices (1-2 hours)
- Recommendation 6: Create DOC_QUALITY_CHECKLIST.md for ongoing quality assurance (2-3 hours)
- Recommendation 7: Update Documentation/README.md navigation (1 hour)

## Success Criteria
- [ ] TACTIC_DEVELOPMENT.md expanded with Section 2.5 (complete modal_t example), Section 4 (Aesop integration), Section 5 (simp lemma design)
- [ ] METAPROGRAMMING_GUIDE.md created with 8 sections covering LEAN 4 metaprogramming fundamentals

- [ ] All new documentation follows formal symbol backtick standard (Unicode symbols in backticks)
- [ ] Developer can implement apply_axiom and modal_t tactics after reading updated documentation without external research
- [ ] Zero broken cross-references between documentation files

## Technical Design

### Architecture Overview

This implementation follows a documentation-first enhancement strategy organized in three execution waves (High/Medium/Low priority) with 7 phases addressing critical documentation gaps identified in research reports 021 and 022. The design prioritizes enabling automation implementation (Task 7, 40-60 hours) by providing concrete metaprogramming guidance, eliminating external research dependencies, and clarifying phased execution strategy.

**Core Documentation Components**:

1. **TACTIC_DEVELOPMENT.md Expansion** (Phase 1): Enhance existing tactic guide with complete modal_t implementation example, Aesop integration patterns, and simp lemma design for modal/temporal operators. This addresses Gap 1 (insufficient tactic guidance) by providing concrete working examples using Lean.Elab.Tactic API.

2. **METAPROGRAMMING_GUIDE.md Creation** (Phase 2): New systematic guide covering LEAN 4 metaprogramming fundamentals: Lean.Meta operations, expression pattern matching, goal management, proof term construction, error handling, and three development approaches (macro-based, elab_rules, direct TacticM). This addresses Gap 2 (missing metaprogramming resource) by consolidating all essential tactic development knowledge.

3. **PHASED_IMPLEMENTATION.md Creation** (Phase 3): New roadmap document showing Wave 1-4 execution strategy with parallel task opportunities, critical path analysis, and time savings estimates (25-32% with proper parallelization). This addresses Gap 3 (no phased roadmap) by translating TODO.md tasks and best practices recommendations into actionable execution waves.

4. **CLAUDE.md Consolidation** (Phase 4): Add Section 10.1 "LEAN 4 Metaprogramming and Automation Quick Reference" with tactic development approach, automation strategy, priority tactics, key modules, Aesop integration pattern, simp lemma design guidance, and phased implementation reference. This addresses CLAUDE.md fragmentation by providing AI assistant with consolidated quick reference.

5. **TODO.md Enhancement** (Phase 5): Add 2 new tasks derived from best practices report recommendations not currently tracked: Task 12 (Create Tactic Test Suite, 10-15 hours), Task 13 (Create Proof Strategy Documentation, 5-10 hours). Update dependency graph and status summary.

6. **Documentation Quality Infrastructure** (Phase 6): Create DOC_QUALITY_CHECKLIST.md for ongoing quality assurance with consistency checks, completeness checks, accuracy checks, formatting checks, and integration checks. Ensures documentation remains accurate and synchronized as implementation progresses.

7. **Navigation Update** (Phase 7): Update Documentation/README.md to reference new metaprogramming and implementation guides, ensuring discoverability.

**Dependency Architecture**:

```
Phase 1 (Expand TACTIC_DEVELOPMENT.md) → Phase 2 (Create METAPROGRAMMING_GUIDE.md)
  ↓                                            ↓
Phase 4 (Streamline CLAUDE.md) ← Phase 3 (Create PHASED_IMPLEMENTATION.md)
  ↓
Phase 5 (Update TODO.md) → Phase 6 (Create DOC_QUALITY_CHECKLIST.md)
  ↓
Phase 7 (Update README navigation)
```

**Critical Path**: Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 4 (these enable Task 7 automation implementation)

**Parallel Opportunities**: Phases 4, 5, 7 can run in parallel with Phases 1-2

### Integration Points

**1. Best Practices Report Integration (Report 021)**:
- Phase 1 integrates report lines 254-299 (LEAN 4 Metaprogramming Architecture), 301-348 (Aesop Integration), 350-377 (Simp Lemma Design)
- Phase 2 integrates report lines 254-263 (Key Modules), 266-299 (Three Approaches), 384-451 (Proof Search)
- Phase 3 integrates report lines 479-675 (Six Recommendations with Effort Estimates)
- Phase 5 integrates report lines 619-644 (Tactic Test Patterns), 649-675 (Proof Strategy Examples)

**2. TODO.md Task Coordination**:
- New Task 12 (Phase 5) is concurrent with existing Task 7 (Implement Core Automation)
- New Task 13 (Phase 5) is independent, can run anytime
- Phase 3 provides execution guidance for existing Tasks 1-11

**3. CLAUDE.md AI Assistant Integration**:
- Phase 4 provides consolidated quick reference for AI assistants answering "How do I implement modal_t tactic?"
- Section 10.1 references all new documentation created in Phases 1-3
- Enables AI assistants to provide concrete code examples without external research

**4. Existing Documentation Cross-References**:
- TACTIC_DEVELOPMENT.md (Phase 1) references new METAPROGRAMMING_GUIDE.md (Phase 2) for implementation details
- METAPROGRAMMING_GUIDE.md (Phase 2) references TACTIC_DEVELOPMENT.md for tactic-specific patterns
- PHASED_IMPLEMENTATION.md (Phase 3) references TODO.md for task details, IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md for module status
- CLAUDE.md (Phase 4) references all new guides for detailed guidance
- DOC_QUALITY_CHECKLIST.md (Phase 6) validates consistency across all documentation

**5. Formal Symbol Backtick Standard Compliance**:
- All phases must wrap Unicode symbols in backticks: `□`, `◇`, `△`, `▽`, `⊢`, `⊨`
- Phase 6 checklist includes formatting verification for formal symbol compliance

### File Modification Strategy

**Files to Create** (5 new files):
1. `/home/benjamin/Documents/Philosophy/Projects/ProofChecker/Documentation/Development/METAPROGRAMMING_GUIDE.md` (Phase 2)
2. `/home/benjamin/Documents/Philosophy/Projects/ProofChecker/Documentation/Development/PHASED_IMPLEMENTATION.md` (Phase 3)
3. `/home/benjamin/Documents/Philosophy/Projects/ProofChecker/Documentation/Development/DOC_QUALITY_CHECKLIST.md` (Phase 6)
4. (No Archive files created - Phase 5 Task 13 defers Archive file creation to future implementation)

**Files to Modify** (3 existing files):
1. `/home/benjamin/Documents/Philosophy/Projects/ProofChecker/Documentation/Development/TACTIC_DEVELOPMENT.md` (Phase 1)
2. `/home/benjamin/Documents/Philosophy/Projects/ProofChecker/CLAUDE.md` (Phase 4)
3. `/home/benjamin/Documents/Philosophy/Projects/ProofChecker/TODO.md` (Phase 5)
4. `/home/benjamin/Documents/Philosophy/Projects/ProofChecker/Documentation/README.md` (Phase 7)

**Modification Approach**:
- Use Edit tool (not Write) for all existing file modifications to preserve history
- Add new sections to existing files rather than rewriting
- Maintain existing section numbering and structure
- Follow 100-character line limit and formal symbol backtick standard

### Quality Assurance Strategy

**Documentation Quality Targets**:
- **Completeness**: All 6 best practices recommendations represented in final documentation
- **Consistency**: Tactic counts, completion percentages, file references consistent across all documents
- **Accuracy**: All code examples compile, all file references include correct line numbers
- **Formatting**: 100-character line limit, formal symbol backticks, ATX-style headings, language-specified code blocks
- **Integration**: CLAUDE.md references align with actual file locations, TODO.md tasks match documentation

**Verification Approach**:
- Phase 6 creates DOC_QUALITY_CHECKLIST.md with 5 check categories (consistency, completeness, accuracy, formatting, integration)
- Each phase includes verification checklist before marking complete
- Final verification: Developer can implement apply_axiom and modal_t tactics after reading updated documentation without external research

**Rollback Strategy**:
- All file modifications use Edit tool (preserves git history)
- Can revert individual file changes via git if issues discovered
- Phase-by-phase implementation allows early detection of documentation quality issues

  grep -Eo '\[.*\]\(([^)]+)\)' "$file" | grep -Eo '\([^)]+\)' | tr -d '()' | while read ref; do
    if [[ "$ref" =~ ^http ]]; then
      # Skip external URLs (requires network check)
      continue
    else
      # Check local file references
      if [[ ! -f "$ref" ]] && [[ ! -f "$(dirname $file)/$ref" ]]; then
        echo "BROKEN REFERENCE in $file: $ref"
      fi
    fi
  done
done
```

**Formal Symbol Backtick Compliance** (all modified/created files):
```bash
# Check all documentation files for unbacked formal symbols

            CLAUDE.md TODO.md; do
  UNBACKTICKED=$(grep -E "□|◇|△|▽|⊢|⊨" "$file" | grep -v '`' | wc -l)
  if [ "$UNBACKTICKED" -gt 0 ]; then
    echo "FAIL: $file has $UNBACKTICKED unbackticked formal symbols"
  else
    echo "PASS: $file formal symbol backtick compliance"
  fi
done
```

**Line Limit Compliance** (all modified/created files):
```bash
# Check all documentation files for line limit violations
for file in Documentation/Development/TACTIC_DEVELOPMENT.md \

            Documentation/Development/PHASED_IMPLEMENTATION.md \
            Documentation/Development/DOC_QUALITY_CHECKLIST.md \
            CLAUDE.md TODO.md Documentation/README.md; do
  awk -v f="$file" 'length > 100 {print f" line "NR" exceeds 100 chars: "length" chars"; exit 1}' "$file"
  if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "PASS: $file line limit OK"
  else
    echo "FAIL: $file line limit exceeded"
  fi
done
```

### Acceptance Testing

- Success = implementation without external research required

10. **Zero broken cross-references** (Success Criterion 10):
- Verified via Integration Testing cross-reference validation above

### Test Execution Order

1. **Phase-by-phase unit testing**: Execute inline verification after each phase completes
2. **Integration testing after Phase 7**: Run cross-reference validation, formal symbol check, line limit check
3. **Acceptance testing**: Verify all 10 success criteria met
4. **Manual verification**: Developer reads documentation and attempts tactic implementation without external research

### Rollback Criteria

If any phase fails verification:
1. Review phase tasks for completion
2. Check Edit tool operations for correct file modifications
3. If issues found, revert phase changes via git
4. Fix issues and re-execute phase
5. Do not proceed to dependent phases until current phase passes verification

### Internal Dependencies (Phase Dependencies)

```
Phase 1 (Expand TACTIC_DEVELOPMENT.md)
  → Required by: Phase 2 (TACTIC_DEVELOPMENT.md references METAPROGRAMMING_GUIDE.md)
  → Independent, can start immediately

Phase 2 (Create METAPROGRAMMING_GUIDE.md)
  → Requires: Phase 1 complete (for cross-reference from TACTIC_DEVELOPMENT.md)
  → Required by: Phase 4 (CLAUDE.md references METAPROGRAMMING_GUIDE.md)

Phase 3 (Create PHASED_IMPLEMENTATION.md)
  → Requires: Phase 1, Phase 2 complete (for context)
  → Required by: Phase 4 (CLAUDE.md references PHASED_IMPLEMENTATION.md)

Phase 4 (Streamline CLAUDE.md)
  → Requires: Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3 complete (references all new guides)
  → Required by: Phase 5 (TODO.md coordination with CLAUDE.md)

Phase 5 (Update TODO.md)
  → Requires: Phase 4 complete (coordination with CLAUDE.md references)
  → Required by: Phase 6 (DOC_QUALITY_CHECKLIST.md validates TODO.md)

Phase 6 (Create DOC_QUALITY_CHECKLIST.md)
  → Requires: Phase 5 complete (validates updated TODO.md)
  → Required by: Phase 7 (README.md references checklist)

Phase 7 (Update Documentation/README.md)
  → Requires: Phase 6 complete (references all new guides)
  → Final phase, no dependents
```

### Blocking Relationships

**No External Blockers**: This plan addresses documentation gaps and does not require implementation work to proceed. All phases can execute without waiting for ProofChecker implementation changes.

**Sequential Phase Execution Required**: Phases 1-7 must execute sequentially due to cross-reference dependencies. Phase N requires Phase N-1 complete before starting.

**Parallel Opportunities**: Phases 4, 5, 7 involve independent file modifications and could potentially run in parallel if cross-reference coordination is carefully managed. However, sequential execution (1→2→3→4→5→6→7) is recommended for clarity and quality assurance.

### Task Coordination with TODO.md

**New Tasks Added** (Phase 5):
- Task 12: Create Comprehensive Tactic Test Suite - Concurrent with existing Task 7 (Implement Core Automation)
- Task 13: Create Proof Strategy Documentation - Independent, can run anytime

**Phased Implementation Guide** (Phase 3):
- Provides execution guidance for existing TODO.md Tasks 1-11
- Clarifies Wave 1-4 strategy and parallel opportunities
- Does not modify task definitions, only provides strategic roadmap

**No Conflicts**: New tasks (12, 13) and phased roadmap (Phase 3) complement existing TODO.md structure without conflicts.
