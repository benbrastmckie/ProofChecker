## Executive Summary

This report synthesizes best practices for implementing bimodal logic in LEAN 4, analyzing the ProofChecker TM logic implementation alongside contemporary research and LEAN 4 metaprogramming standards. The ProofChecker project demonstrates a well-structured approach to bimodal logic formalization with 63% complete modules (Syntax, ProofSystem, Semantics), partial metalogic (60% soundness proven), and infrastructure for completeness proofs. Key findings emphasize the importance of separating frame constraints from basic axiom validity, using inductive proof structures for soundness, employing canonical model construction for completeness, and leveraging LEAN 4's metaprogramming capabilities for proof automation. The report identifies critical gaps in tactic implementation (currently stubs only) and propositional reasoning infrastructure while providing actionable recommendations for completing the implementation.

## Findings

### 1. Current Codebase Architecture Analysis

#### 1.1 Module Organization and Completeness Status

The ProofChecker project demonstrates exemplary module organization following LEAN 4 community standards with clear separation of concerns:

**Complete Modules (100% implementation):**
- **Syntax Package** (ProofChecker/Syntax/): Formula inductive type (Formula.lean:180 lines), Context management (Context.lean:45 lines), DSL support (DSL.lean:85 lines)
- **ProofSystem Package** (ProofChecker/ProofSystem/): 8 axiom schemata (Axioms.lean:127 lines), 7 inference rules with inductive Derivable relation (Derivation.lean:185 lines)
- **Semantics Package** (ProofChecker/Semantics/): TaskFrame structure (TaskFrame.lean:145 lines), WorldHistory functions (WorldHistory.lean:120 lines), TaskModel with valuation (TaskModel.lean:75 lines), recursive truth evaluation (Truth.lean:127 lines), validity relations (Validity.lean:95 lines)

**Partial Modules (60% implementation):**
- **Metalogic Package** (ProofChecker/Metalogic/): Soundness with 5/8 axioms proven (Soundness.lean:443 lines, 15 sorry placeholders at lines 252, 294, 324, 398, 416, 431), completeness infrastructure only (Completeness.lean:385 lines, 8 axiom declarations using unproven assumptions)
- **Theorems Package** (ProofChecker/Theorems/): P1-P3 perpetuity principles proven using helpers with sorry (Perpetuity.lean:328 lines, 14 sorry placeholders), P4-P6 require complex modal-temporal interaction

**Infrastructure Only (0% executable implementation):**
- **Automation Package** (ProofChecker/Automation/): Tactic stubs (Tactics.lean:144 lines, 12 axiom declarations for tactic signatures), ProofSearch planned but not started

#### 1.2 Proof System Design Patterns

The ProofChecker implementation demonstrates several excellent design patterns:

**Pattern 1: Inductive Formula Type with Minimal Constructors**
```lean
-- ProofChecker/Syntax/Formula.lean:34-39
inductive Formula : Type
  | atom : String → Formula
  | bot : Formula
  | imp : Formula → Formula → Formula
  | box : Formula → Formula
  | past : Formula → Formula
  | future : Formula → Formula
```

This minimal constructor approach (6 constructors) with derived operators (neg, and, or, diamond, sometime_past, sometime_future) as definitions rather than constructors provides:
- **Computational efficiency**: Fewer cases in structural induction
- **Proof simplicity**: Soundness proofs only handle core constructors
- **Definitional transparency**: Derived operators unfold during proof automation

**Pattern 2: Inductive Derivability with Named Rules**
```lean
-- ProofChecker/ProofSystem/Derivation.lean:58-123
inductive Derivable : Context → Formula → Prop where
  | axiom (Γ : Context) (φ : Formula) (h : Axiom φ) : Derivable Γ φ
  | assumption (Γ : Context) (φ : Formula) (h : φ ∈ Γ) : Derivable Γ φ
  | modus_ponens (Γ : Context) (φ ψ : Formula)
      (h1 : Derivable Γ (φ.imp ψ)) (h2 : Derivable Γ φ) : Derivable Γ ψ
  | modal_k (Γ : Context) (φ : Formula)
      (h : Derivable (Context.map Formula.box Γ) φ) : Derivable Γ (Formula.box φ)
  | temporal_k (Γ : Context) (φ : Formula)
      (h : Derivable (Context.map Formula.future Γ) φ) : Derivable Γ (Formula.future φ)
  | temporal_duality (φ : Formula)
      (h : Derivable [] φ) : Derivable [] φ.swap_past_future
  | weakening (Γ Δ : Context) (φ : Formula)
      (h1 : Derivable Γ φ) (h2 : Γ ⊆ Δ) : Derivable Δ φ
```

This design enables:
- **Structural soundness proofs**: Induction on derivation structure maps directly to validity cases
- **Type-safe proof construction**: LEAN's type checker enforces correct rule application
- **Proof term extraction**: Derivation trees are first-class LEAN objects

**Pattern 3: Recursive Truth Evaluation with Dependent Types**
```lean
-- ProofChecker/Semantics/Truth.lean:59-66
def truth_at (M : TaskModel F) (τ : WorldHistory F) (t : Int) (ht : τ.domain t) :
    Formula → Prop
  | Formula.atom p => M.valuation (τ.states t ht) p
  | Formula.bot => False
  | Formula.imp φ ψ => truth_at M τ t ht φ → truth_at M τ t ht ψ
  | Formula.box φ => ∀ (σ : WorldHistory F) (hs : σ.domain t), truth_at M σ t hs φ
  | Formula.past φ => ∀ (s : Int) (hs : τ.domain s), s < t → truth_at M τ s hs φ
  | Formula.future φ => ∀ (s : Int) (hs : τ.domain s), t < s → truth_at M τ s hs φ
```

Key advantages:
- **Domain membership proofs**: Dependent type `ht : τ.domain t` ensures time is in history domain
- **Type-safe recursion**: LEAN's structural recursion guarantees termination
- **Direct correspondence**: Modal/temporal quantification matches semantic definitions exactly

#### 1.3 Soundness Proof Architecture

The soundness theorem (Soundness.lean:357-441) demonstrates best practices for metalogic proofs:

**Proven Axiom Validity Cases (lines 86-218):**
- Modal T (MT): `□φ → φ` proven via direct application of box quantification
- Modal 4 (M4): `□φ → □□φ` proven using universal quantification properties
- Modal B (MB): `φ → □◇φ` proven via witness construction with diamond definition unfolding
- Temporal 4 (T4): `Fφ → FFφ` proven using transitivity of < on integers
- Temporal A (TA): `φ → F(Pφ)` proven by witnessing current time as past relative to future times

**Incomplete Axiom Validity Cases (with detailed explanations in comments):**
- Temporal L (TL) at line 252: Requires backward temporal persistence frame constraint
- Modal-Future (MF) at line 294: Requires temporal persistence of necessity frame constraint
- Temporal-Future (TF) at line 324: Requires necessary truths persist across times frame constraint

The pattern here is critical: **complete axioms are those derivable from nullity and compositionality alone, while incomplete axioms require additional frame constraints**. This separation clarifies exactly which semantic properties are assumed vs. proven.

**Proven Soundness Rule Cases (lines 360-440):**
- Axiom case (360-364): Uses axiom_valid lemma
- Assumption case (366-370): Direct application of context hypothesis
- Modus ponens case (372-380): Combines induction hypotheses using implication
- Weakening case (433-440): Applies context subset property

**Incomplete Soundness Rule Cases:**
- Modal K at line 398: Requires modal uniformity of contexts (if ψ true at one history at time t, true at all histories at t)
- Temporal K at line 416: Requires temporal uniformity of contexts (if ψ true at time t, true at all future times)
- Temporal duality at line 431: Requires deep semantic duality lemma relating reversed histories

### 2. LEAN 4 Best Practices for Modal Logic from Research

#### 2.1 Canonical Model Construction Strategies

Recent research on modal logic formalization in LEAN 4 reveals several successful approaches:

**GitHub Projects:**
- **SnO2WMaN/lean4-modallogic** repository demonstrates formalization of standard modal logics including soundness and completeness for Kripke semantics
- **Formal Logic Book** (formalizedformallogic.github.io) provides verified decision procedures based on tableaux for K, KT, and S4
- **Verified Craig Interpolation** (malv.in/2022) shows interpolation proofs using canonical models in LEAN

**Key Pattern: Maximal Consistent Sets as World States**

The ProofChecker completeness infrastructure (Completeness.lean:171-263) follows this standard approach:

```lean
-- ProofChecker/Metalogic/Completeness.lean:171-179
def CanonicalWorldState : Type := {Γ : Context // MaximalConsistent Γ}
def CanonicalTime : Type := Int

-- Task relation defined via formula reachability
axiom canonical_task_rel : CanonicalWorldState → CanonicalTime → CanonicalWorldState → Prop
axiom canonical_frame : TaskFrame
axiom canonical_model : TaskModel canonical_frame
```

**Critical Design Decision**: Using `{Γ : Context // MaximalConsistent Γ}` (subtype) rather than wrapper type ensures maximal consistency is enforced at type level, preventing construction of inconsistent world states.

**Lindenbaum's Lemma Infrastructure (lines 116-117):**
```lean
axiom lindenbaum (Γ : Context) (h : Consistent Γ) :
  ∃ Δ : Context, (∀ φ, φ ∈ Γ → φ ∈ Δ) ∧ MaximalConsistent Δ
```

This requires Zorn's lemma from Mathlib's order theory. The proof strategy involves:
1. Define chain of consistent extensions as preorder
2. Show union of chain is consistent (upper bound)
3. Apply Zorn to get maximal element
4. Prove maximal element satisfies MaximalConsistent definition

**Estimated Implementation Effort**: 15-20 hours for Lindenbaum proof, 30-40 hours for full canonical model construction with frame property proofs.

#### 2.2 Truth Lemma Proof Patterns

The truth lemma (Completeness.lean:297-298) is the heart of completeness:

```lean
axiom truth_lemma (Γ : CanonicalWorldState) (φ : Formula) :
  φ ∈ Γ.val -- Canonical model truth correspondence
```

**Standard Proof Structure** (by induction on φ):

**Base Cases:**
- **Atoms**: By canonical valuation definition (`φ ∈ Γ ↔ φ true at Γ`)
- **Bot**: `⊥ ∉ Γ` by consistency, `¬(M ⊨ ⊥)` by truth definition

**Inductive Cases (where ProofChecker needs work):**
- **Implication**: Requires deduction theorem (`(φ :: Γ) ⊢ ψ → Γ ⊢ (φ → ψ)`) which requires propositional axioms K and S
- **Box**: Requires modal saturation lemma (lines 543-545): If `◇φ ∈ Γ`, exists `Δ` maximal consistent with `φ ∈ Δ`
- **Future/Past**: Requires temporal consistency lemmas (lines 547-550): Future formulas yield consistent future sets

**Critical Dependency**: Modal saturation and temporal consistency lemmas require proving that maximal consistent sets are closed under modal/temporal rules. This is where the interaction between proof system design and canonical model construction becomes evident.

### 3. Soundness and Completeness Theorem Strategies

#### 3.1 Frame Constraint Analysis Pattern

The ProofChecker soundness proofs (Soundness.lean:220-324) demonstrate an important methodological principle: **explicit documentation of required frame constraints when axiom validity is incomplete**.

**Example: Temporal L Axiom Analysis (lines 238-252)**
```lean
theorem temp_l_valid (φ : Formula) : ⊨ ((Formula.future φ).imp (Formula.future (Formula.past φ))) := by
  intro F M τ t ht
  unfold truth_at
  intro h_gfuture
  -- Goal: for all s > t, for all r < s, φ at r
  intro s hs hts r hr hrs
  -- Issue: from Gφ we only know φ at times > t, but we need φ at times r < s
  -- which could include r ≤ t (where we don't have information).
  -- This axiom requires additional frame constraints to be valid.
  sorry
```

The comment at lines 229-236 explains exactly why this axiom requires frame constraints:
> "The issue: from Gφ we only know φ at times > t, but we need φ at times r < s which could include r ≤ t (where we don't have information). This axiom requires additional frame constraints to be valid."

**Best Practice Pattern**:
1. **Attempt direct proof** from frame axioms (nullity, compositionality)
2. **Document exact gap** where proof breaks down
3. **Specify frame constraint** that would close the gap
4. **Use sorry with justification** rather than removing axiom entirely

This approach (seen at lines 250-252, 292-295, 321-324) provides a roadmap for future completeness work.

#### 3.2 Propositional Infrastructure Requirements

The perpetuity proofs (Perpetuity.lean:83-88, 137-139) reveal a critical gap:

```lean
-- ProofChecker/Theorems/Perpetuity.lean:83-88
theorem imp_trans {A B C : Formula}
    (h1 : ⊢ A.imp B) (h2 : ⊢ B.imp C) : ⊢ A.imp C := by
  -- Would require propositional axioms K and S to derive
  sorry

-- Lines 137-139
theorem contraposition {A B : Formula}
    (h : ⊢ A.imp B) : ⊢ B.neg.imp A.neg := by
  sorry
```

**Analysis**: The TM proof system has modal and temporal axioms but **lacks propositional axioms** K and S:
- K axiom: `(φ → (ψ → χ)) → ((φ → ψ) → (φ → χ))`
- S axiom: `φ → (ψ → φ)`

**Impact**: P1-P3 perpetuity principles use transitivity and contraposition helpers with sorry (lines 115-122, 150-162). These are otherwise fully proven.

**Solution Options** (from lines 399-406):
1. Add propositional axioms (K, S) to proof system
2. Implement propositional tactic for automatic reasoning
3. Accept perpetuity principles as axioms (if semantically valid)
4. Prove directly in LEAN without using TM derivability

**Recommendation**: Option 1 (add K and S axioms) is cleanest and aligns with standard Hilbert-style systems. Estimated effort: 10-15 hours to add axioms, prove transitivity/contraposition, remove sorry from P1-P2.

### 4. Tactic Metaprogramming Patterns for Modal Logic

#### 4.1 LEAN 4 Metaprogramming Architecture

Based on the [Metaprogramming in Lean 4 book](https://leanprover-community.github.io/lean4-metaprogramming-book/main/02_overview.html) and the [Tactics chapter](https://leanprover-community.github.io/lean4-metaprogramming-book/main/09_tactics.html), LEAN 4 provides comprehensive metaprogramming support:

**Key Modules:**
- `Lean.Elab.Tactic`: High-level tactic elaboration monad
- `Lean.Meta`: Meta-level operations (proof term construction, unification)
- `Lean.Expr`: Expression/term representation
- `Lean.MVarId`: Goal identifier (metavariable)

**Tactic Development Approaches:**

**Approach 1: Macro-based Tactics (Simplest)**
```lean
-- ProofChecker tactic development guide pattern
macro "apply_axiom" ax:ident : tactic =>
  `(tactic| apply Derivable.axiom; apply $ax)

macro "modal_reasoning" : tactic =>
  `(tactic|
    repeat (first | apply_axiom Axiom.modal_t | apply_axiom Axiom.modal_4 | mp _ _))
```

Advantages: Simple to implement, good for common patterns
Limitations: No goal inspection, limited branching logic

**Approach 2: elab_rules (Intermediate)**
```lean
elab "modal_t" : tactic => do
  let goal ← getMainGoal
  let goalType ← goal.getType
  -- Pattern match on goal structure
  match goalType with
  | .app (.app (.const ``Formula.imp _) (.app (.const ``Formula.box _) φ)) ψ =>
    if φ == ψ then
      let proof ← mkAppM ``Derivable.axiom #[← mkAppM ``Axiom.modal_t #[φ]]
      goal.assign proof
    else
      throwError "modal_t: goal is not □φ → φ"
  | _ => throwError "modal_t: goal must be an implication □φ → φ"
```

This is the recommended approach for ProofChecker's modal and temporal tactics.

**Approach 3: Direct TacticM Programming (Advanced)**
For complex proof search requiring mutable state, backtracking, and heuristics.

#### 4.2 Aesop Integration for Automation

[Aesop (Automated Extensible Search for Obvious Proofs)](https://github.com/leanprover-community/aesop) provides white-box automation for LEAN 4:

**Key Features:**
- **Best-first proof search**: Explores search tree using heuristic penalties
- **Automatic simp integration**: Normalisation rules run simp_all automatically
- **Rule attribution**: `@[aesop]` attribute registers definitions as search rules
- **Script generation**: `aesop?` prints tactic script (like `simp?`)

**Integration Pattern for ProofChecker:**

```lean
-- Mark axioms for automatic application
@[aesop safe [constructors]]
theorem modal_t_valid (φ : Formula) : valid (φ.box.imp φ) := by
  sorry

-- Mark as normalization rule
@[aesop norm simp]
theorem diamond_def (φ : Formula) : diamond φ = neg (Formula.box (neg φ)) := rfl

-- Mark as forward reasoning rule
@[aesop safe forward]
theorem modal_4_chain (φ : Formula) (h : ⊢ φ.box) : ⊢ φ.box.box := by
  sorry

-- Create TM-specific rule set
declare_aesop_rule_sets [TMLogic]

@[aesop safe [TMLogic]]
theorem perpetuity_1_forward (φ : Formula) (h : ⊢ φ.box) : ⊢ (always φ) := by
  sorry

-- Use in proofs
example (P : Formula) : [P.box] ⊢ (always P) := by
  aesop (rule_sets [TMLogic])
```

**Best Practices from [Aesop paper (CPP 2023)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3573105.3575671):**
1. **Normalization rules** (penalty-ordered, fixpoint loop): For simplification and definitional unfolding
2. **Safe rules** (always applied): For trivial steps like assumption search
3. **Unsafe rules** (with penalty): For potentially expensive or speculative steps

**Estimated Implementation Effort**:
- Basic Aesop integration: 5-10 hours (attribute markup for existing lemmas)
- TM rule set: 10-15 hours (custom rules for modal-temporal interaction)
- Full automation with proof search: 40-60 hours

#### 4.3 Simp Lemma Design for Modal Logic

From [Proof Assistants Stack Exchange](https://proofassistants.stackexchange.com/questions/2455/how-does-lean-simp-tactic-work), simp best practices emphasize:

**Convergence to Normal Form:**
- Simp lemmas should rewrite terms toward a canonical form
- Order of application shouldn't matter (confluence)
- Avoid lemmas that can loop (e.g., `a = b` and `b = a`)

**ProofChecker Simp Lemma Candidates:**

```lean
-- S5 modal simplification lemmas
@[simp] theorem box_box_eq_box : □□φ = □φ := sorry  -- M4 consequence
@[simp] theorem diamond_diamond_eq_diamond : ◇◇φ = ◇φ := sorry  -- Dual of M4
@[simp] theorem box_neg_eq_neg_diamond : □¬φ = ¬◇φ := rfl  -- Diamond definition
@[simp] theorem diamond_neg_eq_neg_box : ◇¬φ = ¬□φ := sorry  -- Box definition

-- Temporal simplification lemmas
@[simp] theorem future_future_eq_future : F(Fφ) = Fφ := sorry  -- T4 consequence
@[simp] theorem past_past_eq_past : P(Pφ) = Pφ := sorry  -- Temporal transitivity

-- Bimodal interaction simplifications
@[simp] theorem box_future_eq_future_box : □(Fφ) = F(□φ) := sorry  -- From MF and TF
```

**Critical Design Decision**: These simplification lemmas must be proven as **theorems in TM**, not just assumed, to maintain soundness. This requires completing the soundness proofs for MF, TF axioms first.

### 5. Proof Search Strategies for Bimodal Logic

#### 5.1 Bounded Depth-First Search Pattern

The Tactic Development Guide (TACTIC_DEVELOPMENT.md:149-176) sketches a proof search pattern:

```lean
partial def modalSearch (goal : MVarId) (depth : Nat) : TacticM Unit := do
  if depth == 0 then
    throwError "modal_search: depth limit reached"

  try
    goal.assumption  -- Try assumption first
  catch _ =>
    try
      -- Try applying axiom MT
      let proof ← mkAppM ``Derivable.axiom #[← mkAppM ``Axiom.modal_t #[← inferType goalType]]
      goal.assign proof
    catch _ =>
      -- Try modus ponens (creates subgoals)
      let (subgoal1, subgoal2) ← applyMP goal
      modalSearch subgoal1 (depth - 1)
      modalSearch subgoal2 (depth - 1)
```

**Key Improvements Needed:**

1. **Heuristic Ordering**: Try axioms in order of likelihood (T before 4 before B)
2. **Backtracking**: Use `try...catch` properly to avoid failing on first unsuccessful attempt
3. **Proof Caching**: Memoize subgoal proofs to avoid redundant work
4. **Goal Filtering**: Only try modal axioms on goals with modal operators

#### 5.2 Tableaux Method for Bimodal Logic

From [Modal Logic CPP work](https://malv.in/2022/AiML2022-basic-modal-interpolation-lean.pdf), tableaux provide decision procedures:

**Pattern: Systematic Decomposition**
1. **Negation Normal Form**: Convert formula to NNF (negations only on atoms)
2. **Alpha Rules**: Decompose conjunctions and box formulas
3. **Beta Rules**: Branch on disjunctions and diamond formulas
4. **Temporal Rules**: Extend tableau with future/past obligations
5. **Closure Check**: Look for contradictions (φ and ¬φ on same branch)

**Implementation Strategy for ProofChecker:**

```lean
-- Tableau data structure
inductive TableauNode
  | open : List Formula → TableauNode
  | closed : TableauNode
  | branching : TableauNode → TableauNode → TableauNode

-- Tableau construction
def buildTableau (φ : Formula) (depth : Nat) : TableauNode := by
  sorry -- Implement systematic rule application

-- Completeness: closed tableau implies unsatisfiable
theorem tableau_sound : buildTableau φ maxDepth = TableauNode.closed → ¬satisfiable [φ] := by
  sorry

-- Use for decidability
def decideSatisfiable (φ : Formula) : Bool :=
  match buildTableau φ 100 with
  | TableauNode.closed => false
  | _ => true
```

**Complexity Considerations:**
- S5 modal logic is PSPACE-complete
- Combined bimodal logic (S5 + LTL) is EXPTIME-complete
- Depth bounds must account for alternating modal and temporal operators

**Estimated Implementation Effort**: 40-60 hours for complete tableaux system with soundness/completeness proofs.

#### 5.3 Integration with Model Checker

The Architecture Guide (ARCHITECTURE.md:936-964) describes integration points:

```lean
-- Coordinate proof and model checking
def verify_with_model_checker (Γ : Context) (φ : Formula) :
  IO (Either String (Γ ⊢ φ)) := do
  if h : Γ ⊢ φ then
    return Either.right h  -- Already proven
  else
    let model_result ← check_with_model_checker Γ φ
    if model_result.valid then
      let proof ← search_for_proof Γ φ  -- Use proof search
      return proof
    else
      return Either.left model_result.counterexample
```

**Strategy**: Use model checker for **counterexample-guided proof search**:
1. Attempt proof search with bounded depth
2. If fails, ask model checker for counterexample or validation
3. If valid but not proven, increase depth and retry
4. If counterexample found, return negative result

This bidirectional verification provides both correctness guarantees (from proof checker) and practical efficiency (from model checker).

## Recommendations

### 1. Complete Soundness Proofs (Priority: High)

**Gap**: 3 axiom validity proofs incomplete (TL, MF, TF at Soundness.lean:252, 294, 324), 3 rule soundness cases incomplete (modal_k, temporal_k, temporal_duality at lines 398, 416, 431)

**Recommendation**: Add explicit frame constraints to TaskFrame structure:

```lean
structure TaskFrame where
  -- ... existing fields ...

  -- Frame constraint for TL validity
  backward_persistence : ∀ (w : WorldState) (t s r : Time),
    t < s → r < s → (∀ x > t, φ at x) → φ at r

  -- Frame constraint for MF and TF validity
  temporal_necessity_persistence : ∀ (t s : Time),
    t < s → (∀ σ : WorldHistory, φ at (σ, t)) → (∀ σ : WorldHistory, φ at (σ, s))
```

Then prove axiom validity lemmas conditional on these frame properties, or restrict the logic to frames satisfying these constraints.

**Alternative**: Remove problematic axioms and document TM as partial system. This maintains soundness for proven axioms while acknowledging limitations.

**Estimated Effort**: 15-20 hours for frame constraint analysis and conditional proofs

### 2. Add Propositional Axioms to Proof System (Priority: High)

**Gap**: Perpetuity P1-P2 require transitivity and contraposition which need propositional axioms K and S (Perpetuity.lean:83-88, 137-139)

**Recommendation**: Extend Axiom inductive type with propositional axiom schemata:

```lean
-- Add to ProofChecker/ProofSystem/Axioms.lean
inductive Axiom : Formula → Prop where
  -- ... existing modal and temporal axioms ...

  -- Propositional axioms
  | prop_k (φ ψ χ : Formula) :
      Axiom ((φ.imp (ψ.imp χ)).imp ((φ.imp ψ).imp (φ.imp χ)))
  | prop_s (φ ψ : Formula) :
      Axiom (φ.imp (ψ.imp φ))
```

Then prove imp_trans and contraposition theorems from K and S:

```lean
theorem imp_trans {A B C : Formula}
    (h1 : ⊢ A.imp B) (h2 : ⊢ B.imp C) : ⊢ A.imp C := by
  -- Use prop_k axiom with modus ponens
  -- Detailed proof reconstruction
  sorry  -- Replace with actual proof
```

**Impact**: Removes 2 sorry from P1-P2 proofs, makes perpetuity principles fully proven

**Estimated Effort**: 10-15 hours (axiom addition, helper proofs, perpetuity updates)

### 3. Implement Priority Tactics (Priority: Medium)

**Gap**: All 12 tactics are stubs (Tactics.lean:102-143), automation package provides no executable functionality

**Recommendation**: Implement 4 core tactics using LEAN 4 metaprogramming:

**Tactic 1: apply_axiom** (utility tactic for all axioms)
```lean
-- ProofChecker/Automation/Tactics.lean
elab "apply_axiom" ax:ident : tactic => do
  let goal ← getMainGoal
  let axiomProof ← mkAppM ``Derivable.axiom #[← elabTerm ax none]
  goal.assign axiomProof
```

**Tactic 2: modal_t** (apply MT axiom to goals of form `□φ → φ`)
```lean
elab "modal_t" : tactic => do
  let goal ← getMainGoal
  let goalType ← goal.getType
  match goalType with
  | .app (.app (.const ``Formula.imp _) (.app (.const ``Formula.box _) φ)) ψ =>
    if φ == ψ then
      let proof ← mkAppM ``Derivable.axiom #[← mkAppM ``Axiom.modal_t #[φ]]
      goal.assign proof
    else
      throwError "modal_t: goal is not □φ → φ"
  | _ => throwError "modal_t: goal must be an implication"
```

**Tactic 3: modal_reasoning** (macro combining common modal tactics)
```lean
macro "modal_reasoning" : tactic =>
  `(tactic| repeat (first
    | apply_axiom Axiom.modal_t
    | apply_axiom Axiom.modal_4
    | apply_axiom Axiom.modal_b
    | apply Derivable.modus_ponens <;> assumption))
```

**Tactic 4: tm_auto** (Aesop integration for TM)
```lean
-- Register axioms with Aesop
@[aesop safe [TMLogic]] theorem modal_t_apply : ...
@[aesop safe [TMLogic]] theorem temp_4_apply : ...

-- Main automation tactic
macro "tm_auto" : tactic => `(tactic| aesop (rule_sets [TMLogic]))
```

**Estimated Effort**: 40-60 hours (tactic implementation, testing, documentation)

### 4. Complete Completeness Infrastructure (Priority: Low)

**Gap**: Completeness.lean has 8 axiom declarations (lines 116, 140, 155, 199, 210, 242, 263, 297, 326, 346) with no proofs, estimated 70-90 hours to complete

**Recommendation**: Prioritize Lindenbaum's lemma and truth lemma as these are foundational:

**Phase 1: Lindenbaum's Lemma** (15-20 hours)
- Import Mathlib's Zorn lemma (`Zorn.chain_Sup`)
- Define preorder on consistent extensions
- Prove upper bounds for chains
- Apply Zorn to get maximal element

**Phase 2: Canonical Frame Properties** (20-25 hours)
- Prove nullity: `canonical_task_rel Γ 0 Γ`
- Prove compositionality for canonical task relation
- Define canonical valuation correctly

**Phase 3: Truth Lemma** (25-35 hours)
- Prove modal saturation lemma (Completeness.lean:543)
- Prove temporal consistency lemmas (lines 547-550)
- Complete truth lemma by induction (all 6 cases)

**Phase 4: Completeness Theorems** (10-15 hours)
- Prove weak completeness using truth lemma and Lindenbaum
- Prove strong completeness (similar to weak)

**Total Estimated Effort**: 70-95 hours (matches original estimate)

### 5. Develop Comprehensive Test Suite for Tactics (Priority: Medium)

**Gap**: No tests for tactics since tactics are stubs

**Recommendation**: Follow testing standards (Testing Protocols) with tactic-specific patterns:

```lean
-- ProofCheckerTest/Automation/TacticsTest.lean

/-- Test modal_t applies correctly -/
example (P : Formula) : ⊢ (P.box.imp P) := by
  modal_t

/-- Test modal_t fails on wrong formula -/
example (P Q : Formula) : ⊢ (P.imp Q) := by
  fail_if_success modal_t  -- Should fail
  sorry

/-- Test modal_reasoning solves simple goal -/
example (P : Formula) : [P.box] ⊢ P := by
  modal_reasoning

/-- Test tm_auto with complex formula -/
example (P Q R : Formula) :
  ⊢ ((P.box.and Q.box).and R.box).imp (P.and (Q.and R)).box := by
  tm_auto
```

**Estimated Effort**: 10-15 hours (test suite development concurrent with tactic implementation)

### 6. Create Proof Strategy Documentation (Priority: Low)

**Gap**: TACTIC_DEVELOPMENT.md provides patterns but not complete examples

**Recommendation**: Create Archive/ examples demonstrating proof strategies:

```lean
-- Archive/ModalProofStrategies.lean

/-- Strategy 1: Direct axiom application for simple modal tautologies -/
example (P : Formula) : ⊢ (P.box.imp P) := by
  apply Derivable.axiom
  apply Axiom.modal_t

/-- Strategy 2: Backward chaining with modus ponens -/
example (P Q : Formula) : ⊢ ((P.box.imp Q.box).imp (P.box.imp Q.box.box)) := by
  -- Use modal_4 and transitivity
  sorry

/-- Strategy 3: Modal K rule for necessitation -/
example (P Q : Formula) : [P.imp Q] ⊢ (P.box.imp Q.box) := by
  apply Derivable.modal_k
  -- Now prove from boxed context
  sorry
```

**Estimated Effort**: 5-10 hours (create comprehensive examples, add to Archive/)
