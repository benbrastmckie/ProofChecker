## Testing Strategy

### Testing Execution

**Phase-Specific Tests**: All phases included immediate validation:
- NOTE tag removal verification
- Content presence verification (grep patterns)
- Cross-reference validation
- Backtick formatting verification

**Final Integration Testing**:
- Zero remaining NOTE tags confirmed
- All formal symbols use backtick formatting
- All LEAN file references verified present
- All documentation cross-references verified correct
- Line length: 132 violations (pre-existing, not introduced by revisions)

### Test Files Created

**No test files created** - This was a documentation-only workflow. Validation performed
through bash scripts in plan test sections.

### Test Execution Requirements

Tests executed via inline bash commands during implementation:
```bash
# NOTE tag verification
grep -c "^<!-- NOTE:" Documentation/Research/CONCEPTUAL_ENGINEERING.md

# Content presence verification
grep -q "Semantic Level.*World-Histories" Documentation/Research/CONCEPTUAL_ENGINEERING.md
grep -q "Truth Conditions for Tense Operators" Documentation/Research/CONCEPTUAL_ENGINEERING.md

# Cross-reference verification
grep -q "WorldHistory.lean" Documentation/Research/CONCEPTUAL_ENGINEERING.md
grep -q "ARCHITECTURE.md" Documentation/Research/CONCEPTUAL_ENGINEERING.md

# Backtick formatting
grep -q "\`□\`" Documentation/Research/CONCEPTUAL_ENGINEERING.md
```

### Coverage Target

**Documentation Coverage**: 100% - All 4 NOTE tags resolved, all 16 research
recommendations implemented

## Documentation Standards Compliance

**Formal Symbol Backtick Standard**: ✓ Compliant
- All formal symbols use backticks: `□`, `◇`, `G`, `F`, `H`, `P`, `→`, `∀`, `∃`
- Code blocks properly formatted with triple backticks
- LEAN code snippets include syntax highlighting indicators

**Line Length Limit (100 chars)**: ⚠ Partial Compliance
- New text wrapped for 100-char compliance
- Document has 132 pre-existing line length violations
- Full compliance requires document-wide reformatting (future task)

**Flush-Left Formatting**: ✓ Compliant
- No unnecessary indentation in prose
- Code blocks and lists properly indented per Markdown standards

**Cross-Reference Standard**: ✓ Compliant
- All LEAN file references include line numbers or line ranges
- All documentation references include section names or page indicators

## Research Integration Status

**Report 001 (Descriptive-Normative Distinction)**: ✓ Fully Integrated
- 5 recommendations implemented in Phase 1
- Reframed terminology, expanded material conditional example

**Report 002 (AI Semantic Requirements)**: ✓ Fully Integrated
- 4 recommendations implemented in Phase 2
- Revised AI justification, added context parameters

**Report 003 (Modal Logic Historicity)**: ✓ Fully Integrated
- 3 recommendations implemented in Phase 2
- Corrected modality characterization, added historical modality explanation

**Report 004 (Planning World-History Semantics)**: ✓ Fully Integrated
- 4 recommendations implemented in Phases 3-4

  strategy

**Total Integration**: 16/16 recommendations (100%)

## Context Usage

**Iteration 1 Context Usage**: 45% (~90k/200k tokens)
**Iteration 2 Context Usage**: 36% (~72k/200k tokens)
**Combined Context Usage**: Healthy margin, no exhaustion risk

## Blockers and Resolutions

**No blockers encountered**. All phases completed successfully with:
- Clear research guidance from 4 detailed reports
- Well-defined plan with explicit success criteria
- Comprehensive testing protocols built into each phase

## Recommendations for Future Work

### Line Length Compliance
Document-wide reformatting recommended to eliminate 132 pre-existing line length
violations. This would require:
- Systematic review of all paragraphs
- Line wrapping at natural boundaries (after commas, before conjunctions)
- Preservation of formal notation readability

### Cross-Reference Updates
Consider adding:
- Line number verification automation (check that referenced LEAN file line numbers
  remain accurate after code changes)
- Bidirectional link validation (ensure Architecture Guide references back to
  CONCEPTUAL_ENGINEERING.md)

### Additional Documentation
Consider expanding:
- Historical modality section with more examples from planning domains
- Truth conditions section with counterexamples (when tense operators fail to capture
  planning intuitions)
- Layer 1 motivation with concrete counterfactual examples that break Core Layer
  approximation

## Conclusion

All 6 implementation phases completed successfully. The CONCEPTUAL_ENGINEERING.md
document now provides:
- Clear distinction between descriptive natural language semantics and normative formal
  logic
- Accurate characterization of AI systems' benefits from formal semantics (training data
  generation)
- Correct identification of TM logic's historical modality (not metaphysical modality)
- Comprehensive explanation of world-history semantics with planning interpretations
- Detailed truth conditions for tense operators in planning contexts
- Clear explanation of Core Layer approximation strategy and its limitations

All 4 research reports updated with Implementation Status sections confirming successful
integration. Documentation standards compliance achieved with exception of pre-existing
line length violations.

**Ready for review and potential git commit.**
