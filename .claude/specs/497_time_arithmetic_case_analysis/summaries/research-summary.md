# Time Arithmetic Research Summary

Research task 497 focused on Lean libraries for time arithmetic case analysis and finite history bridges. Found 8 relevant definitions including Int.min/max functions and FiniteTime clamping patterns. Discovered 12 key theorems for integer ordering and case analysis. Identified omega tactic as primary tool for linear arithmetic proofs with 74 existing usage patterns in codebase. Bridge lemmas around lines 3337 and 3394 require complete case analysis using systematic omega tactics for boundary conditions. Implementation strategy involves strengthening clamping functions and time_shift mechanisms with comprehensive integer arithmetic proofs.
