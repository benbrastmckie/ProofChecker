Complete Task 7 (Implement Core Automation) from TODO.md: Implement remaining 8 tactics (bounded_search, search_with_heuristics, search_with_cache, matches_axiom, find_implications_to, heuristic_score, box_context, future_context), fix Truth.lean for Batteries compatibility, complete Aesop integration, and expand test suite to 50+ tests. Focus on mathematically rigorous self-contained implementation without external dependencies where possible, prioritizing native Lean 4 metaprogramming over external libraries for maximum speed and reliability.
