Use the report /home/benjamin/Documents/Philosophy/Projects/ProofChecker/.claude/specs/021_lean4_bimodal_logic_best_practices/reports/001-lean-4-modal-logic-implementation-best.md in order to systematically improve the documentation in /home/benjamin/Documents/Philosophy/Projects/ProofChecker/Documentation/ along with references to this documentation in CLAUDE.md to help streamline LEAN 4 implementation. I also want to update /home/benjamin/Documents/Philosophy/Projects/ProofChecker/TODO.md with tasks that will improve the implementation going forward.
