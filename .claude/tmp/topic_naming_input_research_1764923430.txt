I want to learn more about including dependencies on Aesop, mathlib, batteries, and what the virtues/costs of attempting greater independence are for the purposes of the present project. Besides some basic algebra, order theory, topology, and lattice theory, I shouldn't need a lot of math, and so wonder what the prospects are for building up the bits I need as opposed to importing them. I want to do what makes the most sense and is considered standard practice, economizing my dependencies wherever possible even if it means more to implement. Nevertheless, I don't want to reinvent the wheel if there is good reason not to and it is standard practice to avoid doing so.
