review all the bad symbols in /home/benjamin/Documents/Philosophy/Projects/ProofChecker/README.md such as '�' and the bad characters in the file tree '## Project Structure' in order to create a plan to both fix all these characters using standardized unicode characters and to update the project standards to include a glossary for formal symbols to standardize usage which follows /home/benjamin/Documents/Philosophy/Projects/Logos/docs/glossary/logical-operators.md and to also indicate the patter for creating file trees in the documentation standards if this has not been done already.
