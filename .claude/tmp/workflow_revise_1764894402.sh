export USER_ARGS="Update the temporal operator naming convention to use all_past/some_past/all_future/some_future for function names (clearer semantic meaning), reserving H/G/P/F for DSL notation. This follows the existing pattern where 'box' is the function and the symbol is the DSL notation. The constructors should be renamed from past/future to all_past/all_future, and derived operators from sometime_past/sometime_future to some_past/some_future. Add a new phase or update Phase 2/3 to include DSL notation definitions. Update all search/replace patterns and documentation references accordingly."
