I am looking to make the following systematic changes to this repository: 1) I want to rename the project from ProofChecker to Logos; and 2) I want to organize the project into layers for the different extensions to the logos where what has been implemented so far belongs to the core layer. The various layer extensions such as the explanatory, epistemic, or normative layers mentioned in /home/benjamin/Documents/Philosophy/Projects/ProofChecker/README.md can be implemented later, but will import the core layer, extending it systematically. There may nevertheless be critical differences, for instance, instead of taking world states to be points as in the core layer, the explanatory layer will define world states to be maximal possible states, and so this will have corresponding changes on the definition of a world history. Research these reorganization changes systematically in order to create a detailed refactor plan that I can use to implement the refactor.
