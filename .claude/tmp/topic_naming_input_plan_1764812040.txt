I just added /home/benjamin/Documents/Philosophy/Projects/ProofChecker/Logos/ to the repo from another repo which described this project. Research these documents and the other documents in /home/benjamin/Documents/Philosophy/Projects/ProofChecker/Documentation/ in order to create a plan to carefully integrate these new Logos/ documents into the repository, making any necessary changes to content, adding cross links, improving the content to be more accurate based on what has been implemented, etc.
