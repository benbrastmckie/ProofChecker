export USER_ARGS="Research the NOTE tags in /home/benjamin/Documents/Philosophy/Projects/ProofChecker/README.md where in general I think the more verbose sections should be moved into other supporting documents in the Documentation/ directory if they exist already, or creating new documents for topics that have not already been addressed and don't fit in naturally with the topics and documentation files that have already been created. It is OK to link documentation for further details in /home/benjamin/Documents/Philosophy/Projects/ProofChecker/README.md where relevant, but I don't want too many links to avoid overwhelming the reader. Use these considerations to pair down /home/benjamin/Documents/Philosophy/Projects/ProofChecker/README.md to provide the most important narrative arc, moving all other topics that are more tangential to the main arc into documentation in Documentation/ (where the main arc should include what the logos is and how to use it and its parts to train AI systems to engage in verified reasoning in an interpreted language). Create a plan to make these systematic changes to /home/benjamin/Documents/Philosophy/Projects/ProofChecker/README.md providing a lucid and professional research tone that is accessible and clear without being verbose or patronizing."
