export WORKFLOW_DESCRIPTION="I am looking to build a proof-checker package that streamlines the implementation of different proof systems in LEAN 4 with pipes to and from the model-checker package. Whereas the model-checker uses python and Z3, I want to know if it makes sense to use another language alongside LEAN 4 for the proof-checker package. Conduct research online to see if it makes sense to develop this project in python, or another language, or if LEAN 4 by itself is sufficient and best used without other languages."
