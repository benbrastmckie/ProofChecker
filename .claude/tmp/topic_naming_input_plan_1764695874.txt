I am concerned that the project file structure needs improvement. for instance, there are various lean files in ProofChecker/ProofChecker/ and then subdirectories with the same names. The README.md shows these files should live in the subdirectories with the same names. Something similar occurs in the ProofCheckerTest/ directory. Also, I want to rename docs/ to Documentation/ to match the same styling as the other directory names, and similarly for the subdirectories it contains. I also want the files in Documentation/ to live in a subdirectory.
