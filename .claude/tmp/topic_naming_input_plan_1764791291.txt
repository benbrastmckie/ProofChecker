I am confused about 5b in /home/benjamin/Documents/Philosophy/Projects/ProofChecker/TODO.md since a temporal order is defined to be a totally ordered abelian group which is already symmetric about each time. That is, given any time x, there is an automorphism which maps x to itself, and maps x + z to x - z for all z. carefully consider what is needed to avoid positing a SymmetricFrame constraint, deriving whatever is needed instead in order to create a detailed lean plan to implement.
