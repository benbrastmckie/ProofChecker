# State Management Rules

## File Synchronization

TODO.md and state.json MUST stay synchronized. Any update to one requires updating the other.

### Canonical Sources
- **state.json**: Machine-readable source of truth
  - next_project_number
  - active_projects array with status, language, priority
  - Faster to query (12ms vs 100ms for TODO.md parsing)

- **TODO.md**: User-facing source of truth
  - Human-readable task list with descriptions
  - Status markers in brackets: [STATUS]
  - Grouped by priority (High/Medium/Low)

## Status Transitions

### Valid Transitions
```
[NOT STARTED] → [RESEARCHING] → [RESEARCHED]
[RESEARCHED] → [PLANNING] → [PLANNED]
[PLANNED] → [IMPLEMENTING] → [COMPLETED]

Any state → [BLOCKED] (with reason)
Any state → [ABANDONED] (moves to archive)
Any non-terminal → [EXPANDED] (when divided into subtasks)
[IMPLEMENTING] → [PARTIAL] (on timeout/error)
```

### Invalid Transitions
- Cannot skip phases (e.g., NOT STARTED → PLANNED)
- Cannot regress (e.g., PLANNED → RESEARCHED) except for revisions
- Cannot mark COMPLETED without all phases done

## Two-Phase Update Pattern

When updating task status:

### Phase 1: Prepare
```
1. Read current state.json
2. Read current TODO.md
3. Validate task exists in both
4. Prepare updated content in memory
5. Validate updates are consistent
```

### Phase 2: Commit
```
1. Write state.json (machine state first)
2. Write TODO.md (user-facing second)
3. Verify both writes succeeded
4. If either fails: log error, preserve original state
```

## Task Entry Format

### TODO.md Entry
```markdown
### {NUMBER}. {TITLE}
- **Effort**: {estimate}
- **Status**: [{STATUS}]
- **Priority**: {High|Medium|Low}
- **Language**: {lean|general|meta|markdown}
- **Started**: {ISO timestamp}
- **Completed**: {ISO timestamp}
- **Research**: [link to report]
- **Plan**: [link to plan]

**Description**: {full description}
```

### state.json Entry
```json
{
  "project_number": 334,
  "project_name": "task_slug_here",
  "status": "planned",
  "language": "lean",
  "priority": "high",
  "effort": "4 hours",
  "created": "2026-01-08T10:00:00Z",
  "last_updated": "2026-01-08T14:30:00Z",
  "artifacts": [
    {
      "type": "research",
      "path": "specs/334_task_slug_here/reports/research-001.md",
      "summary": "Brief 1-sentence description of artifact"
    }
  ],
  "completion_summary": "1-3 sentence description of what was accomplished (required when status='completed')",
  "roadmap_items": ["Optional explicit roadmap item text to match"]
}
```

### Completion Fields Schema

When a task transitions to `status: "completed"`, these fields are populated:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `completion_summary` | string | **Yes** (when completed) | 1-3 sentence description of what was accomplished |
| `roadmap_items` | array of strings | No | Explicit list of ROAD_MAP.md item texts this task addresses (non-meta tasks only) |
| `claudemd_suggestions` | object | No | Suggested CLAUDE.md modifications (meta tasks only) |

**Producer Responsibility**: The `/implement` command populates these fields in CHECKPOINT 2: GATE OUT when a task is successfully completed.

**Consumer Usage**: The `/todo` command extracts these fields via `jq` to:
- Match non-meta tasks against ROAD_MAP.md items for annotation (using `roadmap_items`)
- Display CLAUDE.md modification suggestions for user review (using `claudemd_suggestions` from meta tasks)

### claudemd_suggestions Schema (Meta Tasks Only)

When a meta task (language: "meta") is completed, it may include a `claudemd_suggestions` field to propose CLAUDE.md modifications:

```json
{
  "claudemd_suggestions": {
    "action": "add|update|remove|none",
    "section": "Section Name (e.g., 'Command Workflows', 'Skill Architecture')",
    "rationale": "Why this change is needed (or why no change is needed)",
    "content": "The text to add or the updated text (null for remove/none)",
    "removes": "Text pattern being removed/replaced (null for add/none)"
  }
}
```

**Action Types**:

| Action | When to Use | Required Fields |
|--------|------------|-----------------|
| `add` | New user-facing command, workflow, or pattern | `section`, `rationale`, `content` |
| `update` | Existing documentation is incorrect or incomplete | `section`, `rationale`, `content`, `removes` |
| `remove` | Feature deprecated or workflow replaced | `section`, `rationale`, `removes` |
| `none` | Internal change with no user-visible impact | `rationale` |

**Examples**:

Adding a new command:
```json
{
  "claudemd_suggestions": {
    "action": "add",
    "section": "Command Workflows",
    "rationale": "New /debug command needs user documentation",
    "content": "### /debug - MCP troubleshooting\nDiagnoses MCP server connectivity and tool availability."
  }
}
```

Updating existing documentation:
```json
{
  "claudemd_suggestions": {
    "action": "update",
    "section": "Session Maintenance > Quick Commands",
    "rationale": "Default threshold changed from 8 to 24 hours",
    "removes": "(8-hour default)",
    "content": "(24-hour default)"
  }
}
```

Removing deprecated content:
```json
{
  "claudemd_suggestions": {
    "action": "remove",
    "section": "Command Workflows",
    "rationale": "/sync command removed, documentation is now misleading",
    "removes": "### /sync - Legacy state synchronization"
  }
}
```

No change needed:
```json
{
  "claudemd_suggestions": {
    "action": "none",
    "rationale": "Internal refactor of skill routing; no user-visible changes"
  }
}
```

**Design Principle**: Meta tasks improve the development system itself. When completing a meta task, assess whether CLAUDE.md needs updates:
- **Add**: Only if introducing new user-facing behavior/workflow/pattern
- **Update**: If existing documentation is now incorrect or incomplete
- **Remove**: If the task deprecates or replaces existing functionality
- **None**: If the task is purely internal with no user-visible impact

### Artifact Object Schema

Each artifact in the `artifacts` array:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `type` | string | Yes | `research`, `plan`, `summary`, `implementation` |
| `path` | string | Yes | Relative path from project root |
| `summary` | string | Yes | Brief 1-sentence description of artifact contents |

**Note**: The `summary` field enables skills to link artifacts with meaningful descriptions in postflight operations, without re-reading artifact contents.

## Status Values Mapping

| TODO.md Marker | state.json status |
|----------------|-------------------|
| [NOT STARTED] | not_started |
| [RESEARCHING] | researching |
| [RESEARCHED] | researched |
| [PLANNING] | planning |
| [PLANNED] | planned |
| [IMPLEMENTING] | implementing |
| [COMPLETED] | completed |
| [BLOCKED] | blocked |
| [ABANDONED] | abandoned |
| [PARTIAL] | partial |
| [EXPANDED] | expanded |

## Artifact Linking

When creating artifacts, update TODO.md with links:

### Research Completion
```markdown
- **Status**: [RESEARCHED]
- **Research**: [specs/{N}_{SLUG}/reports/research-001.md]
```

### Plan Completion
```markdown
- **Status**: [PLANNED]
- **Plan**: [specs/{N}_{SLUG}/plans/implementation-001.md]
```

### Implementation Completion
```markdown
- **Status**: [COMPLETED]
- **Completed**: 2026-01-08
- **Summary**: [specs/{N}_{SLUG}/summaries/implementation-summary-20260108.md]
```

## Directory Creation

### Lazy Directory Creation Rule

Create task directories **lazily** - only when the first artifact is written:
```
specs/{NUMBER}_{SLUG}/
├── reports/      # Created when research agent writes first report
├── plans/        # Created when planner agent writes first plan
└── summaries/    # Created when implementation agent writes summary
```

**DO NOT** create directories at task creation time. The `/task` command only:
1. Updates `specs/state.json` (adds task to active_projects)
2. Updates `specs/TODO.md` (adds task entry)

**WHO creates directories**: Artifact-writing agents (researcher, planner, implementer) create directories with `mkdir -p` when writing their first artifact to a task.

**WHY**: Empty directories provide no value (git doesn't track them), clutter the filesystem, and make task creation unnecessarily complex.

### Correct Pattern
```bash
# When writing an artifact (e.g., research report)
mkdir -p "specs/${task_num}_${slug}/reports"
write "specs/${task_num}_${slug}/reports/research-001.md"
```

### Incorrect Pattern
```bash
# DO NOT do this at task creation time
mkdir -p "specs/${task_num}_${slug}"  # Wrong! Creates empty directory
```

## Error Handling

### On Write Failure
1. Do not update either file partially
2. Log error with context
3. Preserve original state
4. Return error to caller

### On Inconsistency Detection
1. Log the inconsistency
2. Use git blame to determine latest
3. Sync to latest version
4. Create backup of overwritten version
