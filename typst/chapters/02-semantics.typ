== Task Frames

Task frames are the fundamental semantic structures for *TM*.
They abstract from universal laws governing transitions between world states while still retaining the temporal duration for a transition to complete.

The following primitives are required to define a task frame:

#figure(
  table(
    columns: 3,
    stroke: none,
    table.hline(),
    table.header(
      [*Primitive*], [*Type*], [*Description*],
    ),
    table.hline(),
    [$W$], [Type], [World states (nonempty)],
    [$D$], [Temporal order], [Durations --- a nontrivial totally ordered abelian group],
    [$w #overset($arrow.r.double.long$, $x$) u$], [$W arrow.r D^+ arrow.r W arrow.r "Prop"$], [Task relation, primitive on the positive cone $D^+$ and extended below],

)

// CONFIRM(paper): def:temporal-order states this definition (source text pinned verbatim in
//   specs/paper-definitions-of-record.md)
#definition("Temporal Order")[
  A *temporal order* is a nontrivial totally ordered abelian group $D = (D, +, 0, lt.eq)$ with *positive cone* $D^+ := { x in D : x gt.eq 0 }$.
]

This algebraic choice is not incidental to the rest of the book: the discrete-or-dense dichotomy driving the completeness architecture of @sec:metalogic depends on $D$ being an ordered abelian group and *fails* for a bare linear order (translation invariance is what globalizes a local gap or density witness).
The Lean structure `TaskFrame` (`Semantics/TaskFrame.lean`) requires exactly this: `D` carries `AddCommGroup`, `LinearOrder`, `IsOrderedAddMonoid`, and `Nontrivial` instances, matching the definition field for field.

#definition("Task Relation")[
  A *task relation* on a nonempty set of world states $W$ over a temporal order $D$ is any parameterized relation $w arrow.r.double.long_x u$ for $w, u in W$ and $x in D^+$, extended to negative durations by the *converse convention*
  $ w arrow.r.double.long_(-x) u := u arrow.r.double.long_x w quad "for" x gt.eq 0, $
  determining, for any world states $w, v in W$ and durations $x, y in D$:
  - *Fiber*: $"Fib"(w, x) := { u in W : w arrow.r.double.long_x u }$.
  - *Cone*: $(w)_x := union.big_(|y| < x) "Fib"(w, y)$ where $x > 0$.
  - *Segment*: $[w, v]_x^y := "Fib"(w, x) inter "Fib"(v, -y)$ where $x, y gt.eq 0$.
]
// CONFIRM(paper): def:task-relation states this definition (source text pinned verbatim in
//   specs/paper-definitions-of-record.md)

There is therefore no separate *Reflection* axiom: the equivalence $w arrow.r.double.long_x u arrow.l.r.double u arrow.r.double.long_(-x) w$ is built into the task relation's definition by the converse convention above, not imposed as a further constraint on frames.
Any converse operation written explicitly in this book uses a superscript inverse ($arrow.r.double.long^(-1)$), never the relation-algebra breve or smile common in the arrow-logic literature; the convention itself carries no operator symbol, being written only as subscript negation.

  + *Compositionality*: $w arrow.r.double.long_(x+y) v$ if and only if $w arrow.r.double.long_x u$ and $u arrow.r.double.long_y v$ for some $u in W$.
  + *Seriality*: $w arrow.r.double.long_x u$ and $v arrow.r.double.long_x w$ for some $u, v in W$.
  + *Limit*: $inter.big_(x > 0) (w)_x = {w}$.
  + *Saturation*: $inter.big S eq.not emptyset$ for any $supset.eq$-directed family $S$ of nonempty fibers and segments.
]#footnote[Compositionality is a *biconditional*, load bearing in both directions.]#footnote[The basic cones $(w)_x$ for $w in W$ and $x > 0$ form the basis of a topology on the world states, and that topology is separated: it is *T1* (each singleton ${w}$ is closed) and hence *R0* (topological indistinguishability is symmetric). Separation is exactly what *Limit* delivers topologically --- no world state other than $w$ lies in every cone around $w$.]

*Compositionality* ensures that executing tasks sequentially yields results consistent with a single task of combined duration, in both directions.
*Seriality* ensures every world state has a successor and a predecessor at every nonnegative duration.
*Limit* ensures that shrinking the duration bound around $w$ pins down $w$ uniquely --- no other world state lies in every cone around it.
*Saturation* is what makes the extension machinery of @sec:convex-histories go through: it guarantees that a $supset.eq$-directed family of nonempty fibers and segments --- the constraints a new time imposes on a partial history, kept as two separate classes, never conflated --- has a common point.
Fibers and segments range over *two separate classes* in *Saturation*; the retired device by which fibers were folded into a one-sided case of segments is not current notation.

Nullity is conspicuously absent from this list because it is not an axiom:

#lemma("Nullity")[
  $w arrow.r.double.long_0 w$ for every world state $w in W$ in every frame $cal(F) = (W, D, arrow.r.double.long)$.
]
// CONFIRM(paper): lem:nullity states this lemma (source text pinned verbatim in
//   specs/paper-definitions-of-record.md)

The proof is choice-free and short: instantiate *Seriality* at $x = 0$ to get some $u in W$ with $w arrow.r.double.long_0 u$; *Limit* at $x arrow.r 0^+$ then forces $u = w$, since $w$ is the unique point in every cone around itself.

#remark("Why Nullity Is a Lemma, Not an Axiom")[
  A reader who has seen other presentations of similar systems might expect "zero duration is a no-op" to be postulated outright, as it was in an earlier draft of this book.
  Demoting it to a derived lemma is a genuine simplification, not mere reshuffling: *Seriality* and *Limit* alone already force it, so a frame satisfying the four frame axioms automatically satisfies Nullity, and nothing beyond those four axioms is needed to get it.
  Stating it as a fifth axiom would therefore not strengthen the theory, only lengthen the definition.
]

The Lean structure `TaskFrame` (`Semantics/TaskFrame.lean`) packages this presentation field-for-field, and the correspondence is one of *agreement*, not divergence: the primitive `TaskRel` relation carries #leanComp, the biconditional *Compositionality* in full (of which the composition, i.e. $arrow.l$, direction is projected out separately as #leanForwardComp, restricted to $x, y gt.eq 0$ exactly as the frame definition states it); #leanConverse packages the *converse convention* as structure data, since a two-sided Lean relation cannot carry the convention in its type, so the pair (two-sided `TaskRel`, #leanConverse) *is* the extended relation over a primitive relation on $D^+$, constraining rather than adding to it; #leanSerial is *Seriality* verbatim, stated by citation as `TaskFrame.Serial TaskRel`; #leanLimit is *Limit* verbatim, in the literal transcribed shape; and #leanSaturation is *Saturation* verbatim, stated by citation as `TaskFrame.Saturation TaskRel` so that fibers and segments remain two separate classes, exactly as the directed-family and frame definitions require --- this field is what the Step Lemma of @sec:convex-histories consumes.
#leanNullityDerived (`TaskRel w 0 w`) is *derived* from these fields via #leanNullityIdentity, matching Nullity's derived status above.

A design fact of the mechanization worth recording: #leanNullityIdentity is stated as an *iff* ($w arrow.r.double.long_0 u arrow.l.r.double w = u$), which is strictly stronger than Nullity's reflexivity-only conclusion --- it additionally asserts injectivity at zero duration.
// CONFIRM(lean): the intended strength of nullity_identity (iff vs reflexivity-only) is settled and documented in
//   Semantics/TaskFrame.lean, consistently with the Nullity lemma this chapter states.

== Convex Histories <sec:convex-histories>

Possible worlds are built up through three tiers, and the order matters: a *partial history* requires only a nonempty domain; a *convex history* additionally requires the domain to be *convex*; and a *possible world* is a convex history whose domain is all of $D$.
Only the total tier is what the semantics of @sec:truth quantifies over.

#definition("Partial History")[
  A *partial history* over a frame $cal(F) = (W, D, arrow.r.double.long)$ is a dependent function $tau : (x : D) arrow.r "dom"(x) arrow.r W$ where $"dom" : D arrow.r "Prop"$ is a *nonempty* subset of $D$ and $tau(x) arrow.r.double.long_(y-x) tau(y)$ for all times $x, y : D$ with $"dom"(x)$ and $"dom"(y)$.
]#footnote[Nonemptiness of the domain is required; convexity is *not*.]
// CONFIRM(paper): def:world-history states the partial-history/world-history/totality tiers this section
//   transcribes (source text pinned verbatim in specs/paper-definitions-of-record.md)

#definition("Convex Domain")[
  A domain $"dom" : D arrow.r "Prop"$ is *convex* if whenever $a, c in "dom"$ with $a lt.eq c$, every time $b$ with $a lt.eq b lt.eq c$ is also in $"dom"$.
  More precisely, for all $a, b, c : D$, if $"dom"(a)$ and $"dom"(c)$ and $a lt.eq b lt.eq c$, then $"dom"(b)$.
  Convexity ensures the domain has no temporal gaps.
]

#definition("Convex History")[
  A *convex history* is any partial history whose domain is convex.
  A *possible world* is any convex history whose domain is total, i.e. $"dom"$ holds of every time, so that $"dom" = D$.
  The set of all possible worlds over frame $cal(F)$ is denoted $H_(cal(F))$: a convex history with a proper convex domain is *not* a member of $H_(cal(F))$, only the possible worlds are.

Not every partial history is total, and it is not obvious that a frame has *any* possible worlds at all --- the existence of $H_(cal(F))$ needs an argument, and this is exactly where *Saturation* earns its place among the frame axioms.

#definition("Constraints on a New Time")[
  For a partial history $tau$ with domain $"dom"$ and a duration $z in.not "dom"$, the *constraints on* $z$ are the segments $[tau(t), tau(s)]_(z-t)^(s-z)$ for times $t, s : D$ with $"dom"(t)$, $"dom"(s)$, and $t < z < s$ when both hold, and the fibers $"Fib"(tau(t), z-t)$ for $t$ with $"dom"(t)$ otherwise.

#corollary("Occurrence")[

*Saturation* is genuinely needed for the Step Lemma in general, but it comes for free when the world-state carrier is finite:

#corollary("Saturation for Finite Carriers")[
  Every frame $cal(F) = (W, D, arrow.r.double.long)$ with finite $W$ satisfies *Saturation*, choice-free.
]
// CONFIRM(paper): cor:saturation-finite states this corollary

#remark("What the Finite-Carrier Discharge Does and Does Not Give")[
  *Saturation* earns its place among the frame axioms because, without it, nothing guarantees a $supset.eq$-directed family of nonempty fibers and segments has a common point --- and the Step Lemma needs exactly that common point to extend a partial history by one more duration.
  The finite-carrier corollary above discharges *Saturation* choice-free whenever $W$ is finite, which covers every worked example and every finite countermodel this book constructs.
  It does *not* discharge *Saturation* for infinite-$W$ frames: those still need the axiom in full.
]

The Lean formalization runs this exact chain. `PartialHistory` and `ConvexHistory` (`Semantics/PartialHistory.lean`, `Semantics/ConvexHistory.lean`) implement the first two tiers, with `ConvexHistory` extending `PartialHistory` by a single `convex` field, and `ConvexHistory.IsTotal` as the totality predicate identifying membership in $H_(cal(F))$ --- the third tier, the possible worlds, has no separate structure of its own and is exactly the subtype `TaskFrame.HF`.
`Semantics/Extension/Constraint.lean`, `Admissible.lean`, `Step.lean`, and `Extension.lean` carry the whole existence chain --- constraints, the Constraint Lemma, admissibility, the Step Lemma, the Extension Theorem, and Occurrence --- as a machine-checked sequence of lemmas rather than restating it inline.

== Task Models

A task model extends a task frame with an interpretation function that assigns truth values to sentence letters at world states.
*Propositions* are subsets of $W$ representing instantaneous ways for the system to be.
Sentence letters express propositions, which can be realized by zero or more world states.
World states themselves are specific configurations of the total system at an instant.

#definition("Task Model")[
  A *task model* defined over a frame $cal(F)$ is a pair $cal(M) = (cal(F), I)$ where the *interpretation function* $I : W arrow.r "Atom" arrow.r "Prop"$ assigns to each world state $w : W$ and sentence letter $p : "Atom"$ a truth value $I(w, p) : "Prop"$.
  We write $I(w, p)$ to indicate that sentence letter $p$ is true at $w$.
]

== Truth Conditions <sec:truth>

Truth is evaluated relative to a model $cal(M)$ providing the interpretation, a *possible world* $tau in H_(cal(F))$ --- a total convex history, per @sec:convex-histories --- and a time $x : D$.
Whereas the model fixes the interpretation of the language, the contextual parameters $tau$ and $x$ determine the truth value of every sentence of the language.

// CONFIRM(paper): def:BL-semantics's box clause ranges over all sigma in H_F with no admissible-history or
//   shift-closure parameter, and def:BL-semantics states the guard-first since/until clauses transcribed below.
#definition("Truth")[
  For model $cal(M)$, possible world $tau in H_(cal(F))$, and time $x : D$, truth is defined by recursion on the six primitive constructors:#footnote[`TruthAt` in `Semantics/Truth.lean`. The box clause quantifies over all possible worlds (`ConvexHistory.IsTotal`), with no admissible-history or shift-closure parameter.]

      &quad "and" cal(M), tau, z tack.r.double phi.alt "for all" z : D "where" x < z < y
  $
]

The atom clause carries a domain conjunct, $x in "dom"(tau)$. At a total evaluation point ($"dom" = D$) the conjunct is vacuously true, so it changes nothing about truth at possible worlds.
It is kept deliberately: `TruthAt` stays meaningful when applied to the *partial* histories the extension machinery of @sec:convex-histories traffics in internally, and the two readings provably agree once restricted to $H_(cal(F))$.

Since and Until use a *strict witness* with an *open guard*: the witness time $y$ is strictly past (respectively strictly future), and the guard $phi.alt$ is required only on the open interval strictly between $y$ and $x$.
The derived tense operators then receive their expected *strict* truth conditions as characterization theorems:#footnote[`future_iff`, `past_iff`, and companions in `Semantics/Truth.lean`; the semantics is irreflexive: G and H exclude the present moment, so the temporal T-axioms $G phi.alt arrow.r phi.alt$ and $H phi.alt arrow.r phi.alt$ are not valid.]

  $
]

The modal operator $square.stroked$ quantifies over all possible worlds $sigma : H_(cal(F))$ at the current time $x : D$.
The temporal operators quantify over all earlier and later times $y : D$ --- over the whole temporal order, not merely the history's domain, so atoms are false (rather than undefined) at times outside $"dom"(tau)$.

#remark("Strict Semantics Costs the T-Axioms")[
  $G$ and $H$ exclude the present moment: they are genuinely *strict*, not the reflexive $lt.eq$/$gt.eq$ convention familiar from some model-checking traditions.
  This has a real cost worth stating plainly, because it is easy to expect otherwise: the temporal T-axioms $G phi.alt arrow.r phi.alt$ and $H phi.alt arrow.r phi.alt$ are *not* valid under this semantics --- truth at every strictly later time says nothing about truth right now.
  What replaces them is *Seriality* (a frame axiom, per the Task Frames section above), supplied axiomatically by BX1/BX1$'$ ($top arrow.r F top$, $top arrow.r P top$) rather than following from the truth conditions themselves.
  The strict convention is not a free stylistic choice: @sec:notes's Design Choices section shows that the reflexive alternative collapses the frame classes this book spends two chapters distinguishing.
]

== Time-Shift

The time-shift operation is used to establish the *perpetuity principles*:
- P1: $square.stroked phi.alt arrow.r triangle.stroked.t phi.alt$ (what is necessary is always the case)
- P2: $triangle.stroked.b phi.alt arrow.r diamond.stroked phi.alt$ (what is sometimes the case is possible)

It is natural to assume that whatever is necessary is always the case, or equivalently, whatever is sometimes the case is possible.
Time-shift enables the validity proof of the bimodal interaction axiom MF ($square.stroked phi.alt arrow.r square.stroked G phi.alt$); together with the derived theorem TF ($square.stroked phi.alt arrow.r G square.stroked phi.alt$) it yields the perpetuity principles.

#definition("Time-Shift")[
  For $tau, sigma in H_(cal(F))$ and $x, y : D$, the possible worlds $tau$ and $sigma$ are *time-shifted from $x$ to $y$*, written $tau #timeshift($x$, $y$) sigma$, if and only if there exists a *translation* $overline(a) : D arrow.r D$, $overline(a)(z) = z + d$ for some $d in D$, where $y = overline(a)(x)$ and $tau(z) = sigma(overline(a)(z))$ for all $z in D$.#footnote[The Lean formalization (`timeShift` in `Semantics/ConvexHistory.lean`) is stated in a deliberately more general form as a design fact of the mechanization: the shift map is an arbitrary order automorphism $overline(a) : D arrow.r D$ rather than a translation, and the definition applies to *partial* histories via the domain clause $"dom"_sigma = overline(a)^(-1)("dom"_tau)$, with $sigma(z) = tau(overline(a)(z))$ on that domain. Restricted to total histories and translations, the two definitions coincide.]
]

Time-shifting preserves the essential structure of histories:

#theorem("Convexity Preservation")[
  If $tau$ has a convex domain and $tau #timeshift($y$, $x$) sigma$, then $sigma$ has a convex domain.

#theorem("Task Preservation")[
  If $tau$ respects the task relation and $tau #timeshift($y$, $x$) sigma$, then $sigma$ respects the task relation.

== Logical Consequence and Validity

Logical consequence and validity are defined uniformly across all temporal types, frames, models, histories, and times.

#definition("Logical Consequence")[
  A formula $phi.alt$ is a *logical consequence* of $Gamma$ (written $Gamma tack.r.double phi.alt$) just in case for every temporal type $D : "Type"$, frame $cal(F) : "TaskFrame"(D)$, model $cal(M) : "TaskModel"(cal(F))$, history $tau in H_(cal(F))$, and time $x : D$, if $cal(M), tau, x tack.r.double psi$ for all $psi in Gamma$, then $cal(M), tau, x tack.r.double phi.alt$.
]

#definition("Validity")[
  A formula $phi.alt$ is *valid* (written $tack.r.double phi.alt$) just in case $phi.alt$ is a logical consequence of the empty set: $emptyset tack.r.double phi.alt$.
  Equivalently, $phi.alt$ is true at every model-history-time triple.
]

#definition("Satisfiability")[
  A context $Gamma$ is *satisfiable* in temporal type $D : "Type"$ if there exist a frame $cal(F) : "TaskFrame"(D)$, model $cal(M) : "TaskModel"(cal(F))$, history $tau in H_(cal(F))$, and time $x : D$ such that $cal(M), tau, x tack.r.double psi$ for all $psi in Gamma$.
]

#theorem("Monotonicity")[
  If $Gamma subset.eq Delta$ and $Gamma tack.r.double phi.alt$, then $Delta tack.r.double phi.alt$.
]

#remark("Determined and Deterministic")[
  The task-frame setting supports a distinction between a history's future being *determined* (every history through the present world state agrees on it) and the frame being *deterministic* (the task relation is functional).
  Both notions, together with the actuality operators that make them expressible, lie outside the scope of the book's formal system by design.
