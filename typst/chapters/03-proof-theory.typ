= Proof Theory <sec:proof-theory>


The proof system for *TM* is the *Burgess-Xu (BX) axiom system*: a Hilbert-style calculus over the Since/Until language of @sec:formulas, with *#axiom-count axiom constructors* organized into nine layers and *#rule-count inference rules*.
Derivations are parameterized by a *frame class* (`Base`, `Dense`, `ZTime`, or `RTime`), which gates the frame-dependent axiom layers.
The system is deliberately fine-grained at the constructor level; @sec:paper-contrast records the deferred tense-primitive subsystem and the intended presentation choices of the axiomatization.

== The Burgess-Xu Axiom System

The #axiom-count axiom schemata are the constructors of the inductive family `Axiom` in `ProofSystem/Axioms.lean`.
Throughout, $phi.alt #snce psi$ and $phi.alt #untl psi$ are the guard-first infix primitives of @sec:formulas: the *guard* $phi.alt$ holds at all strictly intermediate times and the *event* $psi$ at the witness time.
Derived operators: $P phi.alt = top #snce phi.alt$, $F phi.alt = top #untl phi.alt$, $H phi.alt = not P not phi.alt$, $G phi.alt = not F not phi.alt$, and $top = bot arrow.r bot$.
Alongside its structural name (BX1, BX2G, ...), each temporal schema carries a *short name* (TB, UG, UC, TA, ...) shown in the tables below; the short names are the citation form used when an axiom is invoked individually, and the extended systems of the metalogic chapter are picked out by which short-named axioms they add.
Past mirrors (primed rows) are the temporal-duality images of their future counterparts and carry no separate short name.

=== Layer 1: Propositional (4)

    table.hline(),
  ),

Together with modus ponens, these four schemata axiomatize classical propositional logic (K and S give the implicational fragment; EFQ and Peirce restore classical negation over the primitive $bot$).

=== Layer 2: S5 Modal (5)

    table.hline(),
  ),
  caption: none,
)

The metaphysical necessity operator $square.stroked$ is S5: it quantifies over all admissible world histories at the current time.

=== Layer 3: BX Temporal (22)

The temporal core consists of eleven schemata in future/past mirror pairs, following Burgess @burgess1982axioms @burgess1984basic and Xu @xu1988until for Until/Since logic on linear orders.
The primed names denote past mirrors.

  caption: [BX temporal layer. Gaps in the structural numbering (BX2, BX8, BX9, BX14) mark schemata of Burgess @burgess1982axioms that were removed as unsound or unnecessary under the strict-witness/open-guard semantics; see the source comments in `ProofSystem/Axioms.lean`. TB is stated as $top arrow.r F top$, trivially interderivable with the bare $F top$ form of the seriality axiom.],
)

Highlights of the layer:
- *Seriality* (BX1/BX1$'$) replaces the temporal T-axioms, which are invalid under the strict semantics: every time has a strictly later and a strictly earlier time.
- *Monotonicity* (BX2G/BX2H, BX3/BX3$'$) lets Until and Since respect implications holding over the guard interval and at the event.
- *Connectedness* (BX4/BX4$'$) places the present in the past of every future time and in the future of every past time.
- *Self-accumulation and absorption* (BX5/BX6 and mirrors) resolve Until-eventualities axiomatically: an eventuality enriches its own guard, and deferred eventualities collapse.
- *Linearity* (BX7, BX11 and mirrors) orders witnesses linearly, as required on linear temporal orders.
- *Eventuality bridges* (BX10, BX12 and mirrors) connect Until/Since to the derived $F$/$P$ operators.
- *Enrichment* (BX13/BX13$'$, Burgess A3a/A3b @burgess1982axioms) carries information about the current point into the event of an Until/Since formula.

=== Layer 4: Modal-Temporal Interaction (1)

#figure(
  table(
    columns: 3,

    align: (left, left, left),
    table.hline(),

    [MF], [`Axiom.modal_future`], [$square.stroked phi.alt arrow.r square.stroked G phi.alt$],
    table.hline(),
  ),
  caption: none,
)

MF is the sole bimodal interaction axiom: necessary truths remain necessary in the future.
Its companion TF ($square.stroked phi.alt arrow.r G square.stroked phi.alt$) is *derived* (see @sec:derived-axioms).

=== Layer 5: Uniformity (5)

The uniformity axioms concern the discreteness witness $bot #untl top$ ("there is an immediate successor": the guard interval to the witness is empty).
They encode the *uniformity of discreteness* in ordered abelian groups --- by translation invariance, a gap at one point exists at every point and in every accessible world --- and are therefore valid on *all* frames (frame class `Base`).

#figure(
  table(
    columns: 3,

    table.hline(),
  ),
  caption: [`discrete_symm_bwd` is the converse of NP, obtainable via temporal duality, and carries no separate short name.],
)

=== Layers 6--7: Prior and Z1 (3, discrete-only)

Valid on discrete linear orders (frame class `ZTime`), these axioms encode well-ordering for definable sets.

#figure(
  table(
    columns: 4,
    stroke: none,
    align: (left, left, left, left),
    table.hline(),
    table.header([*Name*], [*Short*], [*Lean Constructor*], [*Schema*]),
    table.hline(),
    [Prior-UZ], [UZ], [`Axiom.prior_UZ`], [$F phi.alt arrow.r (not phi.alt #untl phi.alt)$],
    [Prior-SZ], [], [`Axiom.prior_SZ`], [$P phi.alt arrow.r (not phi.alt #snce phi.alt)$],
    [Z1], [Z1], [`Axiom.z1`], [$G(G phi.alt arrow.r phi.alt) arrow.r (F G phi.alt arrow.r G phi.alt)$],
    table.hline(),
  ),
  caption: none,
)

Prior-UZ says that if $phi.alt$ holds somewhere in the future, there is a *nearest* future $phi.alt$-point @reynolds1992 (Venema's axiom (W)); Z1 is the characteristic backward-induction axiom of successor-Archimedean orders such as $ZZ$ @doets1987.

=== Layer 8: Density (2, dense-only)

Valid on densely ordered frames (frame class `Dense`).

#figure(
  table(
    columns: 4,
    stroke: none,
    align: (left, left, left, left),
    table.hline(),
    table.header([*Name*], [*Short*], [*Lean Constructor*], [*Schema*]),
    table.hline(),
    [DN], [DN], [`Axiom.density`], [$G G phi.alt arrow.r G phi.alt$],
    [DI], [NN], [`Axiom.dense_indicator`], [$not (bot #untl top)$],
    table.hline(),
  ),
  caption: none,
)

On a dense order no point has an immediate successor, so the discreteness witness $bot #untl top$ is false everywhere (DI, the Burgess density axiom for Until/Since @burgess1982axioms).
DI is included alongside DN because the density schema alone provably fails to derive it.

=== Layer 9: Reynolds Dedekind (3, Dedekind-only)

Valid on the RTime frame class (dense-and-complete, real-flow orders), these axioms are Reynolds' definable-gap-freeness triple for Until/Since over the reals @reynolds1992.
They are stated with the recurrence abbreviations
$ K^+ phi.alt := not (not phi.alt #untl top), quad quad K^- phi.alt := not (not phi.alt #snce top), $
where $K^+ phi.alt$ says that $phi.alt$ recurs arbitrarily soon in the future and $K^- phi.alt$ that it recurred arbitrarily recently in the past.

#figure(
  table(
    columns: 3,
    stroke: none,
    align: (left, left, left),
    table.hline(),
    table.header([*Short*], [*Lean Constructor*], [*Schema*]),
    table.hline(),
    [Prior-U], [`Axiom.prior_U_gap`], [$(phi.alt #untl top) and F not phi.alt arrow.r (phi.alt #untl (not phi.alt or K^+ not phi.alt))$],
    [], [`Axiom.prior_S_gap`], [$(phi.alt #snce top) and P not phi.alt arrow.r (phi.alt #snce (not phi.alt or K^- not phi.alt))$],
    [Sep], [`Axiom.sep`], [$K^+ phi.alt and not K^+ (phi.alt and (not phi.alt #untl phi.alt)) arrow.r K^+ (K^+ phi.alt and K^- phi.alt)$],
    table.hline(),
  ),
  caption: [Only the future/until direction of Prior-U is axiomatic; its past mirror `prior_S_gap` is the temporal-duality image. These axioms enforce *definable* Dedekind completeness --- no temporal formula characterizes completeness outright.],
)

Prior-U says a bounded region where $phi.alt$ has held throughout acquires a definable upper endpoint; Sep is Reynolds' separation axiom, semantically backed by the separability of the reals.
The axiom CO ($triangle.stroked.t (H phi.alt arrow.r F H phi.alt) arrow.r (H phi.alt arrow.r G phi.alt)$) is *derivable* over this layer rather than axiomatic: it follows from Prior-U together with the base axioms alone (`Theorems/DedekindDerived.lean` `coDerived`).

== Frame Classes <sec:frame-classes>

Derivations are parameterized by a frame class, making frame-dependent reasoning a structural invariant rather than a side condition.

#definition("Frame Class")[
  The type `FrameClass` has four values: `Base`, `Dense`, `ZTime`, and `RTime`, partially ordered with `Base` below every other class, `RTime` above `Dense`, and `ZTime` incomparable with both `Dense` and `RTime`:
  $ "Base" lt.eq "Dense" lt.eq "RTime", quad quad "Base" lt.eq "ZTime". $
  Each axiom constructor is assigned a minimum frame class by `Axiom.minFrameClass`: the #base-count axioms of layers 1--5 are `Base`; Prior-UZ, Prior-SZ, and Z1 (#ztime-only-count axioms) are `ZTime`; DN and DI (#dense-only-count axioms) are `Dense`; Prior-U, its past mirror, and Sep (#rtime-only-count axioms) are `RTime`.
]

The axiom rule of the proof system admits an axiom into a derivation at frame class `fc` only when its minimum frame class is at most `fc`.
Derivations are monotone along the order: `DerivationTree.lift` coerces a derivation at a lower frame class into one at any higher class.

The four classes carry the book's hierarchy of proof systems: `Base` is the base system *TM* itself; `Dense` is the dense extension *TM*#sub[d] (adding DN and DI); `ZTime` is the discrete extension *TM*#sub[f] (adding UZ, its mirror, and Z1); and `RTime` is the complete extension *TM*#sub[c] (adding the Reynolds triple of Layer 9, for the dense-and-complete, real-flow orders).
The frame-classes chapter of Part II develops the semantic side of this correspondence in detail.

== Derived Axioms <sec:derived-axioms>

Several schemata that are primitive axioms of the tense-primitive subsystem's twelve-schema presentation (@sec:paper-contrast) are *derived theorems* of BX:

#figure(
  table(
    columns: 3,
    stroke: none,
    align: (left, left, left),
    table.hline(),
    table.header([*Name*], [*Schema*], [*Derived As*]),
    table.hline(),
    [TK], [$G(phi.alt arrow.r psi) arrow.r (G phi.alt arrow.r G psi)$], [`temporalKDistDerived` (`Theorems/TemporalDerived.lean`)],
    [T4], [$G phi.alt arrow.r G G phi.alt$], [`temporal4Derived` (`Theorems/TemporalDerived.lean`)],
    [TF], [$square.stroked phi.alt arrow.r G square.stroked phi.alt$], [`temporalFutureDerived` (`Theorems/Combinators.lean`)],
    table.hline(),
  ),
  caption: none,
)

TK and T4 follow from the BX Until/Since axioms; TF follows from MF together with MT and M4.
The short names of the layer tables above locate the remaining schemata of that presentation among the BX axioms directly: TB (seriality) is BX1 `serial_future`, TA is BX4 `connect_future`, and TL (future linearity) is BX11 `temp_linearity`.

== Inference Rules

The proof system has #rule-count inference rules, given as the constructors of `DerivationTree`.
Here $Gamma tack.r_(f c) phi.alt$ abbreviates `DerivationTree fc Γ φ`; the plain turnstile $Gamma tack.r phi.alt$ fixes the frame class to `Base`.

#definition("Axiom Rule")[
  If $phi.alt$ matches an axiom schema whose minimum frame class is at most $f c$, then $Gamma tack.r_(f c) phi.alt$.
]

#definition("Assumption Rule")[

  $
]

== Derivation Trees

Derivations are represented as inductive trees.

#definition("Derivation Tree")[
  `DerivationTree fc Γ φ` (written $Gamma tack.r_(f c) phi.alt$) is an inductive type representing a derivation of $phi.alt$ from context $Gamma$ at frame class $f c$, using only axioms whose minimum frame class is at most $f c$.
]

#definition("Height")[
  The height of a derivation tree:
  - Base cases (axiom, assumption): height 0
  - Unary rules: height of subderivation + 1
  - Modus ponens: max of both subderivations + 1
]

`DerivationTree` is a `Type` (not a `Prop`), so derivations can be pattern-matched and measured; the height function enables well-founded recursion in metalogical proofs (notably the deduction theorem).

// CONFIRM(paper): def:S5 + def:BX + def:TMplus jointly state the system this chapter axiomatizes.
//   The three anchor ids are unchanged, but their texts moved in the paper's 2026-09 wave: all
//   three now cite the Logic/Extensions sections for their axioms instead of displaying them, and
//   def:TMplus names the system TM (no + superscript) for the language BL (no + superscript),
//   with extensions TM_z / TM_d / TM_r over BX_z / BX_d / BX_r.
== The Tense-Primitive Subsystem <sec:paper-contrast>

The system of this chapter takes Since and Until as its temporal primitives.
There is also a *tense-primitive subsystem*: the logic of the one-place $H$/$G$ sublanguage (@sec:formulas), presentable economically as the smallest extension of classical propositional logic closed under twelve schemata --- the rules MP, MN, and TD, and the axioms MK, MT, M5, MF, TK, T4, TB, TA, and TL.
That subsystem is *deferred* in this book: its axiom map is recorded in the back matter's design-notes chapter, and the Frame Classes chapter's conservativity note states what its intended future development delivers.
The full system presented here is the book's object of study throughout.

Several presentation choices of the axiomatization are *design facts*, intended rather than incidental:

- *CPL is spelled out*: classical propositional logic is often subsumed in a single phrase; this axiomatization lists its four Hilbert schemata (Layer 1) explicitly, so that derivations are fully constructor-level.
- *S5 is closed under theorems*: M4 and MB appear alongside MT, M5, MK --- derivable in S5 but convenient as primitives.
- *Since/Until is the temporal engine*: with the two-place primitives, TK and T4 become derived theorems, and TB, TA, TL live inside the BX layer (@sec:derived-axioms).
- *Past mirrors are primed constructors*: past duals are generable by the TD rule alone, but the primed mirror constructors (BX1$'$--BX13$'$) are included as primitives, which makes derivations at non-empty contexts more direct.
- *Frame-class axioms are gated structurally*: the extensions *TM*#sub[f], *TM*#sub[d], and *TM*#sub[c] are the `ZTime`, `Dense`, and `RTime` frame classes of @sec:frame-classes rather than separately axiomatized systems.
