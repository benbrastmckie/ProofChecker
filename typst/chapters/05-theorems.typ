== Perpetuity Principles <sec:perpetuity>

The perpetuity principles establish deep connections between modal necessity ($square.stroked$) and temporal operators ($triangle.stroked.t$, $triangle.stroked.b$); they are the touchstone principles P1--P6 of @brastmckie2026possibleworlds, proven here in Lean (`Theorems/Perpetuity/`).
P1 in particular is the formal counterpart of a thesis defended independently in the philosophical literature: every necessarily true proposition is always true @dorr2020diamonds.

  $tack.r square.stroked phi.alt arrow.r triangle.stroked.t phi.alt$

#theorem("P2: Sometimes Implies Possible")[

#theorem("P4: Possibility of Occurrence")[

#theorem("P5: Persistent Possibility")[

]

#theorem("P6: Occurrent Necessity is Perpetual")[
  $tack.r triangle.stroked.b square.stroked phi.alt arrow.r square.stroked triangle.stroked.t phi.alt$
]

#remark("Why the Perpetuity Principles Follow from MF and MT Alone")[
  None of P1--P6 needs a bespoke semantic argument: every one is a theorem of classical propositional and modal reasoning once two ingredients are in hand.
  MT ($square.stroked phi.alt arrow.r phi.alt$, the S5 reflexivity axiom) supplies "necessary implies actual"; MF ($square.stroked phi.alt arrow.r square.stroked G phi.alt$, the bimodal interaction axiom) supplies "necessary implies necessarily always future".
  Composing MF with MT (instantiating MT at $G phi.alt$) already derives TF ($square.stroked phi.alt arrow.r G square.stroked phi.alt$: necessity is preserved into the future's necessity) by nothing more than propositional substitution and modus ponens --- no fresh semantic insight, just classical bookkeeping on axioms already in hand.
  P1--P6 then follow from TF (and its past mirror, via temporal duality) together with classical propositional reasoning and the standard modal/tense duals ($diamond.stroked := not square.stroked not$, $triangle.stroked.b := not triangle.stroked.t not$): the *substance* of the perpetuity principles lives entirely in MF, and everything past that point is bookkeeping the Lean kernel checks mechanically rather than a further creative step.

All six perpetuity principles are fully proven (sorry-free) in the Lean implementation, in `Theorems/Perpetuity/` (`Principles.lean`, with P6 infrastructure in `MonotonicityDuality.lean`'s "Bridge Lemmas for P6 Derivation" section).
