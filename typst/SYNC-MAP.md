# SYNC-MAP: BimodalReference.typ ↔ Lean Source Claim Verification

> **Status (2026-07-15)**: a later revision cut Parts III (Counterfactual Logic) and IV
> (Constitutive Logic) from the book entirely, leaving a two-part reference (Part I: The
> Bimodal System; Part II: Applications). The per-chapter tables below (from the two revision rounds
> vintage) describe the book's now-superseded four/five-part structure at the time each
> claim was verified; they are a historical record and are retained as-is, not rewritten.

> **Status**: this file is a repo-side *development document* recording the
> claim-verification history of the BimodalReference book. It no longer governs the
> compiled PDF: the sync-class banner system (banners, legend, inline ✓/⧖/○/◇ markers)
> was later removed from the book, and the compiled book carries no sync-class
> markings. `scripts/typst-sync-check.sh` now runs two checks only — backtick name
> resolution and count freshness. The legend, enforcement rules, and per-chapter
> assignments below are retained as historical record of how each claim was verified.

Generated during the BimodalReference typst revision.
Lean source ground truth: `FormalSystem/` (excluding `Boneyard/`).

> **Archive consolidation note.** This document is a dated audit record and its historical
> stamps are preserved as written. At the time several of them were taken, archived code lived in
> **two** places: `FormalSystem/Boneyard/` and a second archive nested at
> `FormalSystem/Metalogic/WeakCanonical/Kamp/Boneyard/`. Those are now one tree; the nested
> archive is `FormalSystem/Boneyard/Kamp/KampWeakCanonical/`. Where a stamp below splits a count
> "around the nested archive", the split is what was true then and the path has been annotated,
> not rewritten -- rewriting a dated measurement would falsify the record.

## Sync-Class Legend — HISTORICAL

Every chapter file included by `BimodalReference.typ` formerly carried a
`#sync-banner(class, ...)` call declaring which of four classes governed its claims
(since removed from the book; retained here as the key to the verification tables below):

| Symbol | Class | Meaning |
|--------|-------|---------|
| ✓ | `"check"` (lean-verified) | Every formal claim in the chapter carries a resolving Lean anchor; either sorry-free or its sorry-status is stated plainly (a ✓ chapter may still *report on* an ⧖ result — e.g. "Completeness is stated ✓, proof has open sorries ⧖" — as long as the sorry-status is not hidden). |
| ⧖ | `"sorries"` (with-sorries) | Lean-anchored, but the chapter's headline claims have open proof obligations (sorries) that are enumerated, not glossed over. |
| ○ | `"paper"` (paper-sourced) | Proved in a cited paper (possible_worlds.tex, counterfactual_worlds.tex, or third-party literature); not formalized in this repository. |
| ◇ | `"outlook"` (outlook-planned) | Design/roadmap content; no proof anywhere yet (Lean or paper). |

**Enforcement rules** (checked mechanically by `scripts/typst-sync-check.sh`, Phase 4):

1. No chapter banner-classed ○ or ◇ may contain an inline "lean-verified"/✓ claim about its
   own headline content (a ○/◇ chapter may still *cite* a ✓ result from another chapter).
2. No backticked Lean identifier or path may appear anywhere in `typst/**/*.typ` that fails
   to resolve under `FormalSystem/` (excluding `Boneyard/`), per the Phase 6 extraction
   method below — external-repo (Logos) names are cited as external and commit-pinned, never
   as if they were local Lean names.
3. Per-claim overrides are allowed *inside* a chapter via inline sync-class markers (e.g. a
   ✓ chapter may inline-mark one paragraph ○ where it is quoting the paper) — the chapter
   banner states the *dominant* class; inline markers state exceptions.
4. Every chapter file included by the main file must carry exactly one `#sync-banner(` call
   near its top-level heading.

**Per-chapter assignment** (stub chapters received their sync-class in a later phase):

| Chapter | Class | Rationale |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| `00-introduction.typ` | ✓/◇ mixed | Project-structure claims ✓; book-map/roadmap paragraphs ◇ |
| `01-syntax.typ` | ✓ | Formula type, primitives, derived operators all Lean-anchored, sorry-free |
| `02-semantics.typ` | ✓ | Task frames, truth conditions Lean-anchored, sorry-free |
| `03-proof-theory.typ` | ✓ | 42-constructor axiom system, 7 rules, Lean-anchored, sorry-free |
| `04-metalogic.typ` | ⧖ | Soundness/deduction/Lindenbaum ✓, but completeness carries the 43-sorry chain |
| `05-theorems.typ` | ✓ | Perpetuity P1-P6 and theorem libraries, sorry-free |
| `06-notes.typ` | ⧖ | Reports the same completeness/decidability sorry-status as 04; discrepancy notes are ✓ (Lean-vs-paper facts) |

**Landed**: all seven chapters above carry a `#sync-banner(...)` call
immediately after their level-1 heading; `04-metalogic.typ` and `06-notes.typ` import their
sorry/axiom/rule counts from `typst/generated/status.typ` rather than hand-copying digits
(as do `00-introduction.typ` and `03-proof-theory.typ`, extended opportunistically in the
same pass). This makes both banner-presence and count-freshness mechanically checkable —
input to Phase 4's `scripts/typst-sync-check.sh` (Checks 2 and 4).

## Scope Decisions (Phase 0)

### D1. Primary completeness wiring (verified from live source)

**Primary completeness theorem**: `FormalSystem.Metalogic.BXCanonical.completeness`
(`FormalSystem/Metalogic/BXCanonical/Completeness.lean:135`):

```
theorem completeness (φ : Formula) :
    valid φ → Nonempty (DerivationTree FrameClass.Base [] φ)
```

with frame-class variants `completeness_dense` (`:234`) and `completeness_ztime` (`:276`),
and alternate form `completeness'` (`:177`).

**Live-source evidence** (imports and theorem locations, not README/ROADMAP sentences):
- `Metalogic.lean` imports `FormalSystem.Metalogic.Soundness`,
  `FormalSystem.Metalogic.Decidability`, `FormalSystem.Metalogic.BXCanonical`,
  `FormalSystem.Metalogic.WeakCanonical` — BXCanonical is the wired entry point.
- `BXCanonical/Completeness.lean:4-8` imports `Chronicle.ChronicleToCountermodel`,
  `Chronicle.MCSMixedCase`, and `WeakCanonical` — the proof is wired through
  `countermodel_dense` (`Chronicle/ChronicleToCountermodelBasic.lean:792`, Burgess 1982
  chronicle construction over ℚ, dense case) and the WeakCanonical Reynolds/Doets
  pipeline (`WeakCanonical/Transfer.lean`, discrete case over ℤ), with the mixed case
  eliminated by `mcs_mixed_case_absurd`.

**Status**: Completeness is NOT sorry-free (leaf sorries in Chronicle/WeakCanonical
modules; see counts below). Soundness (`soundness`, `soundness_dense`,
`soundness_ztime`) IS sorry-free.

**Active-secondary approaches** (none silently dropped): `Bundle/` (BFMCS
infrastructure shared by all paths), `Algebraic/` (D-parametric truth lemma /
`ParametricCompleteness`), `WeakCanonical/` (discrete path, also hosts in-progress
Kamp work), `ConservativeExtension/`, `Relational/`.

**Resolution of the three-way doc disagreement**: `Metalogic/README.md` (Bundle/BFMCS
primary) is self-warned stale; `specs/ROADMAP.md` (Chronicle path) is directionally
right — the Chronicle path is the dense-case engine — but the wired top-level theorem
is `BXCanonical.completeness`; the old typst doc (`semantic_weak_completeness`, `FMP/`,
`Representation/`) describes a deleted architecture that survives only in `Boneyard/`.

### D2. Frame-class parametrization scope

IN scope for `03-proof-theory.typ`: the `FrameClass` parameter on `DerivationTree`
(`ProofSystem/Derivation.lean:85+`, constraint `h.minFrameClass ≤ fc`) and the
Base/Dense/ZTime axiom layers are presented in full — they are inseparable from an
accurate 42-constructor presentation. Summary-level in `04-metalogic.typ`: per-frame-class
soundness/completeness variants are named, not proof-sketched. No dedicated frame-class
chapter (deferred).

### D3. latex/ mirror: declared divergence

`latex/BimodalReference.tex` is NOT synced this pass. `typst/README.md` carries an
explicit "latex mirror is stale as of 2026-07-06; typst is authoritative" note.
Full latex sync is a suggested follow-up task.

### D4. Other scope calls

- Kamp separation material appears only as short "work in progress, not
  citable" notes.
- Paper's Objective Modality and 2D Semantics: out of scope (not formalized).
- `docs/reference/*.md` staleness: flagged in the implementation summary, not edited.
- Paper §3.3 Extensions: documented only where Lean-formalized (frame classes);
  otherwise a one-line "not yet formalized" note.
- `Automation/` and `Examples/` directories: not documented.

## Ground-Truth Counts (Phase 1)

Regenerated from source at 2026-07-06, commit `a883361bf` (do not copy forward).

### Axiom constructors

Command: constructor listing of `inductive Axiom` in `ProofSystem/Axioms.lean:76-400`.

**42 constructors in 8 layers** (source's own layer comments):

| Layer | Count | Constructors |
|-------|-------|--------------|
| 1. Propositional | 4 | prop_k, prop_s, ex_falso, peirce |
| 2. S5 Modal | 5 | modal_t, modal_4, modal_b, modal_5_collapse, modal_k_dist |
| 3. BX Temporal | 22 | serial_future/past (BX1/BX1'), left_mono_until_G / left_mono_since_H (BX2G/BX2H), right_mono_until/since (BX3/BX3'), connect_future/past (BX4/BX4'), enrichment_until/since (BX13/BX13'), self_accum_until/since (BX5/BX5'), absorb_until/since (BX6/BX6'), linear_until/since (BX7/BX7'), until_F / since_P (BX10/BX10'), temp_linearity(_past) (BX11/BX11'), F_until_equiv / P_since_equiv (BX12/BX12') |
| 4. Modal-Temporal Interaction | 1 | modal_future (MF) |
| 5. Uniformity | 5 | discrete_symm_fwd/bwd, discrete_propagate_fwd/bwd, discrete_box_necessity |
| 6. Prior | 2 | prior_UZ, prior_SZ |
| 7. Z1 | 1 | z1 |
| 8. Density | 2 | density, dense_indicator |

Frame-class assignment (`Axiom.minFrameClass`, `Axioms.lean:456-462`): Base = 37
(layers 1-5), ZTime-only = 3 (prior_UZ, prior_SZ, z1), Dense-only = 2 (density,
dense_indicator).

### Inference rules

7 rules, unchanged (`ProofSystem/Derivation.lean`, `inductive DerivationTree`):
axiom, assumption, modus_ponens, necessitation, temporal_necessitation,
temporal_duality, weakening.

### Sorry counts (genuine `sorry` terms, comments stripped)

Command: Python comment-stripping scan over `FormalSystem/Metalogic/**/*.lean`
(block `/- -/` and line `--` comments removed before counting `\bsorry\b`).

| Metalogic/ subtree | Sorries |
|--------------------|---------|
| Algebraic/ | 3 |
| BXCanonical/ | 4 (Chronicle/ChronicleToCountermodel.lean 3, Frame.lean 1) |
| Bundle/ | 12 (SuccRelation 7, SuccExistence 3, UntilSinceCoherence 2) |
| WeakCanonical/ | 24 (incl. 2 then in the nested `Kamp/Boneyard/` archive, since consolidated to `FormalSystem/Boneyard/Kamp/KampWeakCanonical/`; 22 excluding it) |
| Core/, ConservativeExtension/, Decidability/, Relational/, SoundnessLemmas/ | 0 |
| Top-level .lean (Completeness, Soundness, Decidability; former DenseSoundness/DiscreteSoundness wrappers archived to Boneyard/SoundnessVariants/) | 0 |
| **Total** | **43** (41 excluding the then-nested `WeakCanonical/Kamp/Boneyard/` archive, now `FormalSystem/Boneyard/Kamp/KampWeakCanonical/`) |

Sorry-free confirmations (0 genuine sorries): `Metalogic/Soundness.lean`,
the archived `Boneyard/SoundnessVariants/` wrappers, entire `Theorems/` tree (including
`Perpetuity/` P1-P6), `Syntax/`, `Semantics/`, `ProofSystem/`.

### Frame classes

`FrameClass` inductive (`ProofSystem/Axioms.lean:422-426`): `Base`, `Dense`,
`ZTime`, `RTime`, partially ordered with Base ≤ Dense, Base ≤ ZTime (Dense, ZTime
incomparable). What each tag denotes semantically is `FrameClass.Sat`
(`Semantics/FrameClassValidity.lean`); the frame properties it maps onto are
`TaskFrame.IsDense`, `TaskFrame.IsZTime` and `TaskFrame.IsRTime`
(`Semantics/FrameProperty.lean`), and class-relative validity is `ValidIn`
(`Semantics/Validity.lean`).

## Claim Verification Table (Phase 1)

Verdicts: `verified` (resolves in live source, meaning matches), `stale` (resolves
only in Boneyard or meaning changed), `not-found`, `fixed` (replaced during the revision).
Locations abbreviated: PS = ProofSystem, SEM = Semantics, ML = Metalogic, TH = Theorems.

## Post-Rewrite Verification (Phase 6)

Re-run stamp: 2026-07-06, commit `a883361bf` (chapters revised in working tree).
Extraction re-run over the seven revised chapters + main file: *271 unique backticked
names*, every one resolving under `FormalSystem/` excluding `Boneyard/` (checked
via `grep -rn --include='*.lean' -F <name> FormalSystem --exclude-dir=Boneyard`;
file and directory paths checked against the filesystem; the deliberate historical
references to `Boneyard/` and to the then-nested `WeakCanonical/Kamp/Boneyard/` archive
resolved as existing paths at the time of this stamp -- that archive has since been
consolidated into `FormalSystem/Boneyard/Kamp/KampWeakCanonical/`). Zero `stale` / `not-found` names remain in the revised text.

Count re-derivation at gate time: `inductive Axiom` constructor count = 42
(`awk '/^inductive Axiom/,/deriving Repr/' ProofSystem/Axioms.lean | grep -c '^  | '`);
`DerivationTree` rule constructors = 7 (Derivation.lean:92-164); sorry counts as
tabulated above. Chapter text matches. `typst compile BimodalReference.typ
build/BimodalReference.pdf` exits 0 (font-substitution warnings only).

## Expanded Chapters: Verification and Re-Stamp

Re-run stamp: 2026-07-07, commit `c44216042` (chapters revised in working tree; the
expansion phases landed sequentially as separate commits on top of the first-revision baseline
`a883361bf`).

The book grew from the seven first-revision chapters to a five-part, nineteen-chapter-or-stub
living monograph: a template/bibliography port (Phase 1), the
generated status-counts script (Phase 2), per-chapter sync-class banners (Phase 3), the
`scripts/typst-sync-check.sh` drift detector (Phase 4), the five-part restructure with 12
new chapter/stub files (Phase 5), a rewritten AI-practitioner introduction (Phase 6), and
five new content chapters: Frame Classes and Extensions, Decidability in Practice, Proof
Automation, The BMLogic Dataset Pipeline, and Dual Verification and Worked Examples
(Phases 7-11).

`scripts/typst-sync-check.sh` (which supersedes and automates the Phase-6 manual
extraction method above) was run against the final Phase-11 tree: **485 unique backticked
candidates** across all fifteen real chapters plus the twelve part-5/stub files, **zero
violations** -- every non-whitelisted candidate resolves under `FormalSystem/`
(excluding `Boneyard/` unless the candidate itself names a historical `Boneyard/` path),
every included chapter carries a `#sync-banner(` call, no paper/outlook chapter carries a
conflicting lean-verified banner, and `typst/generated/status.typ` matches a live
regeneration exactly (42 axiom constructors / 7 rules / 43 sorries -- zero drift from the
first-revision baseline despite five intervening phases and concurrent unrelated Lean work
elsewhere in the repository during Phase 5, see the Phase-5 handoff's transient-drift note).

**Three discrepancies were found and corrected during Phase 7-11 verification** (not
present at the first-revision baseline; introduced by over-attribution in that revision's own
drafting, caught by per-result re-verification against live source rather than assumed):

1. The `FrameClass` inductive and its partial order live in `ProofSystem/Axioms.lean:422-442`.
   The now-deleted top-level frame-condition directory held a *separate* marker-typeclass
   hierarchy that was frequently mistaken for them; that layer has since been removed and
   `chapters/p2-frame-classes.typ` now describes the live interpretation
   (`FrameClass.Sat`, `ValidIn`, `TaskFrame.Is*`) instead.
2. `Metalogic/ConservativeExtension/`'s only theorem, `lift_derivation_qfree`, is a
   fresh-atom naming lemma supporting the irreflexivity argument, not a formalization of
   the paper's base-language-vs-Until/Since-extended-language conservativity as an earlier
   revision of `06-notes.typ` implied. Corrected in both `chapters/p2-frame-classes.typ`
   and `06-notes.typ`'s discrepancy register.
3. `Examples/README.md` claims "dense and discrete" concrete temporal-structure instances;
   `Examples/TemporalStructures.lean` only concretely instantiates the discrete (`Int`)
   case plus a fully generic version. Noted in `chapters/p4-dual-verification.typ`.

Whitelist (`sync-check-whitelist.txt`) additions during the expansion: type-signature/turnstile
illustrations, typst/template API names, planned-but-not-yet-created files (follow-up
tasks), external paper filenames/appendix/theorem labels (`possible_worlds.tex`,
`counterfactual_worlds.tex`), external-repo (Logos) chapter citations, external URLs, and
`lake exe` target names not resolvable as Bimodal Lean identifiers.

## 2026-08-13 Verdict — Book-Paper-Lean Revision (Sync-Check to Zero + Content Corrections)

Ground truth re-verified live at this revision: `check-paper-definitions.sh` exits case (b)
("possible_worlds.tex changed but all 26 recorded definitions are unchanged -- pass"). Lean
source ground truth remains `FormalSystem/` excluding `Boneyard/`.

**`scripts/typst-sync-check.sh` result: PASS on all three checks.** Check 1 (backtick name
resolution) started this revision at **25 violations** (matching the prior audit exactly) and
is now **0**, against **582 candidates**. Check 2 (count freshness) is 0-mismatch after
`typst-status-counts.sh` regenerated `generated/status.typ` (axiom_count 45, sorry_total 5,
sorry_total_excl_boneyard 1). Check 3 (machine-appendix freshness) is clean throughout.

**What closed Check 1, by disposition** (see the task's `reports/01_book-paper-lean-sync-audit.md`
for the full pre-revision classification and this file's own commit history for the per-phase
breakdown):
- *Repointed to a live replacement* (2): `FMP.assignmentSpace_card` / `FMP.filtered_world_bound`
  → `assignmentSpace_card` / `filtered_world_bound` (the Lean source never spells the `FMP.`
  prefix literally); `Bridge.lean` → `MonotonicityDuality.lean` (Perpetuity P6 infrastructure).
- *Claim deleted, not repointed* (the `ConservativeExtension/` cluster, ~9 distinct violations):
  `Metalogic/ConservativeExtension/` exists only under `Boneyard/`; every citation of it, its
  `Lifting.lean`, `lift_derivation_qfree`, `exists_fresh_atom`, `liftDerivationWith`, and
  `ExtFormula.lean` was deleted along with the established-result framing they supported, per
  the task's binding delete-don't-repoint rule.
- *Claim corrected to match the live tree* (2): `FMP/DenseFMP.lean` / `FMP/DiscreteFMP.lean` do
  not exist — `RefinedFilteredTaskFrame` is discrete-only (`[SuccOrder D] [NoMaxOrder D]`),
  forced by the paper's *Limit* axiom collapsing outright over a dense duration type, so there
  never was a per-class split to cite; `rabinovich_translate` lives only in the archive (at the
  time of this stamp `WeakCanonical/Kamp/Boneyard/`, since consolidated to
  `FormalSystem/Boneyard/Kamp/KampWeakCanonical/TranslationEra/`), contradicting the chapter's own correct "a machine-checked
  Kamp theorem is an open problem" sentence a few lines above — rewritten to state the
  Rabinovich-style translation as an archived, paper-side proof strategy.
- *Whitelisted as expository or negative-resolution citations, never a dead Lean path* (8, each
  with a one-line reason in `sync-check-whitelist.txt`): the two `Nat.card(...)` Typst-math
  renderings of `assignmentSpace_card`/`filtered_world_bound`; `allClosed arrow.r "valid"`
  (Typst math for the open `valid_iff_allClosed` bridge); `⊥ U φ` (a rejected-construction
  illustration, not a citation); `thm:ConservativeExtension` and `cor:tm-decidability`
  (deliberate negative-resolution / untracked-anchor citations, same category as the
  already-whitelisted `thm:BLplus-NextPrevious`); `cor:saturation-finite` and
  `def:BLplus-language` (external paper labels with no Lean counterpart to grep).
- *Reformatted instead of whitelisted* (1, per the task's stated preference): `and True` in
  `p2-decidability-practice.typ` — dropped the backticks entirely rather than whitelisting a
  historical, now-fixed vacuous-conjunct pattern.

**Content corrections beyond the mechanical gate** (the headline work; full detail in the
task's own findings note, `specs/442_.../reports/02_revision-findings.md`): the completeness
story was reversed, not merely stale — *TM* is sound but *provably* incomplete over its own
frame classes (the (DD) split-validity witness, following from the discrete-or-dense dichotomy
for ordered abelian groups), with completeness carried instead by machine-checked `BL^+`
systems; the conservative-extension theorem is deleted from the paper and every established-
result framing was rewritten to the four-part backward-unconditional / forward-fails-for-base-
and-discrete / forward-open-for-dense-and-complete status; decidability of *TM* and its
extensions is open, not FMP-established; there are four frame classes (Base, Dense, ZTime,
RTime), not three, with `RTime` sitting strictly above `Dense`; and `02-semantics.typ`'s
task-frame axiomatization was brought up to the paper's current four-axiom `def:frame`
(Compositionality, Seriality, Limit, Saturation) with Nullity restated as a derived lemma. The
expository mandate added a motivated introduction, six reader-stumble remarks, and five cetz
diagrams (the two-fibre `Z`/`R` countermodel witnessing (DD) foremost among them).

No dead `.lean` path was whitelisted at any point in this revision (whitelist diff reviewed
end-to-end against the pre-revision baseline commit `3c949d103`). This section is a dated
addition; the historical tables above it are unmodified, per this file's own header.

## 2026-08-17 Verdict — Target-State Revision (Directive: State the End State, CONFIRM the Gaps)

This revision re-aimed the whole book from a progress report to a statement of the system's
*target end state*, under the governing directive that the manual describes what the finished
Lean repository and the finished source paper both deliver, with every not-yet-established
claim guarded by a maintainer-only `CONFIRM` comment rather than status prose. Changes:

- **CONFIRM convention introduced** (`typst/README.md`, new section beside the Marker
  Convention): `// CONFIRM(lean): ...` / `// CONFIRM(paper): ...` line comments, placed
  immediately above the claim they guard, each stating a checkable proposition. Extraction:
  `grep -rn --include='*.typ' 'CONFIRM(' typst/`.
- **Notation switch, book-wide**: the two temporal primitives are now written infix and
  guard-first (`snce`/`untl` macros in `notation/bimodal-notation.typ`, glyphs `⊲`/`⊳`),
  with since/past ordered before until/future in every table and definition list. The prefix
  event-first Burgess form survives only as a literature-convention footnote in the syntax
  chapter.
- **Completeness restatement** (`04-metalogic.typ`): the old incompleteness exposition
  ((DD) split validity, two-fibre countermodel, Halldén discussion, status table) was cut
  entirely; the chapter now states four target completeness theorems (strong over Base and
  Dense, weak over Z-time and the dense-and-complete class) with the genuine negative
  results (strong completeness provably fails over Z and R by non-compactness) in the body.
  The discrete-or-dense dichotomy survives as a standalone labeled theorem (`@sec:dichotomy`).
- **Paper citations removed from rendered content** (Decision E2): the manual's single
  acknowledgment of the paper is the front-matter Sources block; LaTeX anchors survive only
  inside non-rendered CONFIRM comments (un-backticked) and in
  `specs/paper-definitions-of-record.md`. Whitelist entries orphaned by the citation removal
  and the incompleteness cut were removed after per-entry citation greps (entries still cited
  by `FormalFoundations.typ`, a standalone report outside this revision's scope, were kept).
- **Frame-class/naming alignment**: nine axiom layers (Layer 9 = Reynolds Dedekind triple),
  four-value `FrameClass` with `RTime` hosting the complete extension TM_c
  (dense-and-complete, real flow); short axiom names (TB, UG, UC, TA, ...) added as a
  cross-index column; the tense-primitive fragment is presented throughout as a deferred
  subsystem, with the conservativity theorem box replaced by a deferred-subsystem note.
- The historical tables and prior verdict sections above are unmodified, per this file's own
  header rule.
