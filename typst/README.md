# Bimodal Reference Manual (Typst)

This directory contains the Typst source of the Bimodal TM Logic Reference Manual: a
two-part reference covering the formal *TM* logic, its Lean formalization, and its
automated-reasoning and training-data tooling.

## Building

### Development (with live preview)

```bash
cd typst
typst watch BimodalReference.typ build/BimodalReference.pdf
```

### Production build

```bash
cd typst
typst compile BimodalReference.typ build/BimodalReference.pdf
```

## Book Structure

The book is organized into two parts, preceded by the introduction (see
`BimodalReference.typ`'s `#part-divider(...)` calls, which are the authoritative source
of book order):

| Part | Title | Contents |
|------|-------|----------|
| I | The Bimodal System | Syntax, task-frame semantics, the Burgess-Xu proof system, frame classes, metalogic, decidability in practice, theorems, plus LTL-to-TM positioning, the Vlach/BL* tower, and the decidability frontier |
| II | Applications | Proof automation, the training-data pipeline, dual verification and worked examples |

Back matter: `06-notes.typ` (implementation status and discrepancy notes) and the
References section (rendered from `bibliography.bib`; only cited entries appear).

## Scripts

Two scripts, run from the repository root, keep the book synchronized with Lean source:

```bash
# Regenerate volatile counts (axiom constructors, rules, sorry inventory)
bash scripts/typst-status-counts.sh            # writes typst/generated/status.typ
bash scripts/typst-status-counts.sh --json     # JSON to stdout only

# Mechanical drift detector (2 checks: backtick name resolution, count freshness)
bash scripts/typst-sync-check.sh
```

`typst-sync-check.sh` exits non-zero with a per-violation report if any check fails; see
its header comment for the check definitions and `sync-check-whitelist.txt` for
deliberate exceptions (external-repo citations, type-signature illustrations).

## Package Dependencies

- `@preview/thmbox:0.3.0` - Theorem environments (imported via `template.typ`)
- `@preview/cetz:0.3.4` - Diagrams (light cone, in the introduction)
- `@preview/fletcher:0.5.8` - Diagrams (unification-grid frontispiece, `extension-node`/`part-divider` helpers)

Packages are downloaded automatically on first compile.

## Source Synchronization

The chapters are synchronized against the live Lean source in `FormalSystem/`
(excluding `Boneyard/`). `SYNC-MAP.md` in this directory is a repo-side development
document recording the claim-verification history; it does not govern the compiled PDF.
When the Lean source moves, regenerate via the scripts above rather than editing counts
by hand.

## Follow-Up Work

The remaining in-progress chapters are completed by follow-up work, tracked internally in this
repository's task-management system (not cited here by number -- see the repository rule against
task-number references in deliverables):

| Chapter(s) / Artifact | Scope |
|------------------------|-------|
| `p3-ltl-to-tm.typ`, `p3-vlach-blstar.typ`, `p3-decidability-frontier.typ` | Part I positioning chapters (Lk-abstracted; see EMBARGO note in `p3-decidability-frontier.typ`) |
| `generated/machine-appendix.*` (pointer in `p4-dataset-pipeline.typ`) | Machine-readable JSONL appendix, exported from Lean |
| Part III/IV chapters (tensed counterfactual logic, then constitutive structure) | Superseded -- Parts III/IV were cut entirely, so this scope no longer applies |
| Decidability Frontier `// SLOT-IN:` anchors (`ladder-table`, `complexity-map`, `case-study`) | Lk slot-in for the Decidability Frontier chapter, post-TACAS-acceptance only |

## Marker Convention

Some claims cite a Lean anchor that sits in territory an in-flight Lean formalization task is
expected to move (canonical-frame/completeness proofs, the semantic FMP, and the CO/Reynolds-triple
independence result). Rather than hedge the reader-facing prose, the anchor itself is flagged with
a maintainer-only marker so a later re-sync sweep is a `grep`, not a re-audit:

```
// LEAN-ANCHOR-MAY-MOVE: <scope> -- see typst/README.md
```

placed as a plain Typst line comment immediately above the citing line (invisible in the compiled
PDF). The `<scope>` suffix names what will move the anchor, not a task number:

- `canonical-completeness` -- canonical-frame and completeness anchors under `Metalogic/BXCanonical/`
- `semantic-fmp` -- FMP anchors under `Metalogic/Decidability/FMP/`
- `co-reynolds-independence` -- `ProofSystem/Axioms.lean` Layer 9, immediately above the
  `Axiom.prior_U_gap` constructor

Sweep with `grep -rn "LEAN-ANCHOR-MAY-MOVE" typst/chapters/`. Occurrence list (7 markers,
matching the live grep output as of this revision):

| Scope | File | Line | What it guards |
|-------|------|------|----------------|
| `canonical-completeness` | `chapters/04-metalogic.typ` | 172 | `Weak Completeness (ZTime)`/`(RTime)` theorem boxes (`soundness_dense`/`soundness_ztime`/`soundness_rtime`) |
| `canonical-completeness` | `chapters/04-metalogic.typ` | 178 | `Completeness (Base)` theorem box and its `sorryAx` status note |
| `canonical-completeness` | `chapters/04-metalogic.typ` | 235 | Base-frame completeness open-step paragraph (`WeakCanonical.countermodel_discrete` dependency) |
| `canonical-completeness` | `chapters/06-notes.typ` | 75 | Completeness Status subsection's `Metalogic/BXCanonical/Completeness.lean` citation |
| `semantic-fmp` | `chapters/p2-decidability-practice.typ` | 34 | `FMP-Based Completeness` theorem box (`fmp_completeness`) |
| `semantic-fmp` | `chapters/p2-decidability-practice.typ` | 61 | `filtered_world_bound`/`assignmentSpace_card` sentence |
| `co-reynolds-independence` | `chapters/p2-frame-classes.typ` | 84 | `RTime` row of the axiom-assignment table (`prior_U_gap`/`prior_S_gap`/`sep`) |

This list is not claimed exhaustive of every citation that could plausibly move -- it covers the
headline theorem boxes and summary claims for each scope, which is where a re-sync sweep should
start; a full re-audit after 415/417/419 land may still surface secondary prose mentions the
grep-based sweep above did not individually mark.

## CONFIRM Tag Convention

The manual states the *target end state* of the system — what the finished Lean repository and
the finished source paper both deliver — rather than a progress report. Wherever the body asserts
a result that one of those two artifacts has not yet established, the obligation is carried by a
`CONFIRM` comment, invisible in the compiled PDF:

```
// CONFIRM(lean): <assertion>
// CONFIRM(paper): <assertion>
```

- **Syntax**: exactly this shape — two slashes, one space, `CONFIRM`, parenthesized lowercase
  target qualifier, colon, space, assertion on one line (continuation lines start `//   `).
- **Target qualifiers**: `lean` = the finished Lean repo must satisfy the assertion; `paper` =
  the finished paper must state/restore the assertion.
- **Placement**: immediately above the claim it guards (adjacent line, same indentation), the
  same placement rule as `LEAN-ANCHOR-MAY-MOVE`.
- **Checkability**: every CONFIRM states a checkable proposition — a fully qualified Lean
  theorem name that must exist and be axiom-free (verifiable via `lean_verify` or
  `#print axioms`), a script output condition (e.g. `scripts/typst-status-counts.sh --json`
  reports `sorry_total_excl_boneyard = 0`), or a named paper anchor that must state a given
  proposition. Never "verify this section". CONFIRM comments are the ONLY place in `typst/`
  where paper anchors may appear, and anchors there are written WITHOUT backticks so they never
  become sync-check Check-1 candidates.
- **Extraction commands** (scoped to `.typ` sources so this README's own examples never match):
  `grep -rn --include='*.typ' 'CONFIRM(' typst/` — filter with
  `grep -rn --include='*.typ' 'CONFIRM(lean)' typst/` or
  `grep -rn --include='*.typ' 'CONFIRM(paper)' typst/`.
- **Well-formedness check**:
  `grep -rn --include='*.typ' 'CONFIRM(' typst/ | grep -vE '// *CONFIRM\((lean|paper)\): ' | grep -vE '//   '`
  must output nothing.

## Relationship to LaTeX Version

This directory began as a parallel port of `latex/`.
**As of 2026-07-06 the LaTeX mirror is stale and the Typst version is
authoritative**: the typst chapters were re-synchronized against the live Lean
source, while `latex/BimodalReference.tex` still describes an older
architecture. A full latex re-sync is a suggested follow-up task.

## Font Requirements

The document uses "New Computer Modern" font. If not available, Typst will fall
back to similar fonts.

## Standalone Reports

This directory also hosts standalone research reports that are **not** chapters of
`BimodalReference.typ` and are not `#include`d by it -- they import the book's
`template.typ` and `notation/bimodal-notation.typ` so notation cannot drift, and cite
the shared `bibliography.bib`, but compile to their own, separate PDF.

### `FormalFoundations.typ`

Formal foundations of bimodal *TM* logic: completeness and representation. A
research-facing report on what is proved, what is not, and what a general
representation theorem would require.

```bash
cd typst
typst compile FormalFoundations.typ build/FormalFoundations.pdf
```
