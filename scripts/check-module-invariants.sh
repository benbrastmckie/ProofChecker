# Phase-gate harness for the Lean source tree. Turns "the reorganization did not

#
# Checks:
#   B0  Boneyard exclusion self-test (the single archive must be found and excluded)
#   C1  `lake build` exits 0
#   C2  `#print axioms` for the four flagship theorems matches the recorded baseline
#   C3  ZERO structural `sorry`, asserted BY CONTENT (never by line number)
#   C4  Every `import FormalSystem.*` / `import BimodalTest.*` resolves to a real file
#   C5  Every module-shaped `FormalSystem.*` path in non-specs markdown resolves
#   C6  Known-unreachable live modules still compile (rot guard)
#   C7  Live inventory (informational, never asserted)
#   C8  Aggregator convention: sibling `X.lean` beside `X/`, no `X/X.lean`
#   C9  Zero task-number citations under FormalSystem/, lakefile.lean, README.md,
#       and scripts/
#   C10 Zero references to the pre-relocation docs/latex/typst paths
#   C11 Every import inside FormalSystem/Boneyard/ resolves, or is waived
#   C12 Every slash-shaped source path in docs/ + README.md resolves
#   C13 Every relative markdown link in docs/ + README.md resolves
#   C14 Documented axiom/sorry counts match the tree -- in docs/, README.md AND
#       FormalSystem/**/*.lean docstrings; and the axiom set of every declaration
#       C2 does not cover matches its baseline, including every subject of a
#       SORRY-FREE claim in FormalSystem/Metalogic.lean
#   C15 Every paper-anchor citation in live scope resolves against the pinned
#       record (manifest row, or an explicit KNOWN-ANCHORS row); and, as a second
#       independent assertion, every docs/theorem-index.md row carries its anchor
#       (or the literal `Paper: —` plus a reason) at the declaration itself
#   C16 Batteries env_linter batch (simpNF, docBlame, unusedArguments, ...) has no
#       finding beyond scripts/nolints.json's grandfathered baseline; dupNamespace
#       reported via a live textual (namespace-nesting) approximation, never gated
#   C17 Dead-declaration scan: base identifiers with zero occurrences outside their
#       own declaring line, across FormalSystem/ + Tests/ + repo-wide markdown
#       (REPORTED, not gated)
#   C18 Duplicated prose across README.md, FormalSystem/README.md,
#       FormalSystem/Metalogic/README.md and FormalSystem/Metalogic.lean, at two
#       granularities: whole paragraphs, and sentences of 15+ words
#       (REPORTED, not gated)
#   C19 Docstring-coverage floor (90%), G-12 heuristic refined with a /-!
#       section-comment credit (REPORTED, not gated; 90% floor, never fails)
#   C20 file.lean:NNN citations: tier 1 gates any that is out of range or lands
#       on a blank line (repo-wide); tier 2 reports any at all in
#       publication-facing scope, gated by ENFORCE_C20=1
#   C21 Every declaration named in FormalSystem/MainResults.lean is axiom-pinned by
#       C2 or C14 -- a subset assertion over the two existing baselines, NOT a third
#       baseline
#   C22 The two deliberately-duplicated `allAxiomNames` lists agree
#   C23 Naming regressions: zero live `lemma`, no Uppercase_x name outside the two
#       recorded classes, no new outer-shadows-inner bare-declaration pair. Computed
#       by EXTENDING C16's namespace walker, not by a fourth scanner
#   C24 Every module in the FormalSystem root closure transitively imports
#       FormalSystem.Init, via `lake exe checkInitImports` -- the root file is the
#       single place repository-wide linter options and tactic imports are
#       inherited from, so a module with no path to it silently opts out
#   C25 Every `lean_exe` root declared in lakefile.lean compiles -- the root list
#       is scraped at run time, so a newly declared executable is covered the day
#       it is added and there is no list to forget
#   C9D Task-number citations under docs/ (computed always, soft by default)
#   INV Every `<!-- BEGIN GENERATED: inventory -->` block in the tree is current
#
# Every filesystem traversal excludes the archive via `-not -path '*/Boneyard/*'`.
# The archive was consolidated into a single tree at `FormalSystem/Boneyard/`; the
# former second archive at `Metalogic/WeakCanonical/Kamp/Boneyard/` (63 files /
# 29,256 lines) now lives at `Boneyard/Kamp/KampWeakCanonical/`. B0 asserts the
# directory count is exactly 1, so a second archive reappearing anywhere under
# `FormalSystem/` fails the gate instead of silently splitting the counts again --
# which is what happened before, and is why the name glob (not a path prefix) is
# what the traversals filter on.
#

# --emit-inventory: the generated-count owner
#
# Hand-maintained module inventory tables drift the moment a file is added,
# split or renamed, and nothing in the tree noticed: 40 of 72 per-file line
# counts were wrong when this mode was written, and one README listed five files
# that had moved to another directory. Counts are therefore machine-owned. A
# markdown file opts in by wrapping its table in
#
#     <!-- BEGIN GENERATED: inventory dir=FormalSystem/Automation -->
#     ... table ...
#     <!-- END GENERATED -->
#
# and this mode rewrites every column except the hand-written trailing one.
#
# Marker options (all optional except dir=):
#   dir=<path>              directory the inventory covers, repo-relative
#   rows=loose|subdirs|both|totals
#                           which rows to emit (default both); `totals` emits the
#                           live/archived file and line rollup for dir= instead
#                           of a per-file listing. When dir= is the archive itself
#                           -- any path with a `Boneyard` component -- `totals`
#                           emits ARCHIVE-shaped rows instead of live-shaped ones:
#                           archived file count, archived line count, top-level
#                           subdirectory count, and the repository's
#                           archive-directory count (the same figure B0 asserts).
#                           Live-shaped rows would be a category error there: with
#                           dir=FormalSystem/Boneyard the "live" and "archived"
#                           sets are the same files, so the block would label
#                           archived code as live.
#   empty=skip|include      whether a subdirectory with no `.lean` members gets a
#                           subdirs row (default skip). The archive's README-only
#                           tombstone subtrees are real inventory entries -- the
#                           code was deleted and the README retained as the
#                           historical record -- so the archive's table sets
#                           `empty=include` and they are listed with a zero count
#                           rather than silently dropped.
#   filter=all|aggregators|non-aggregators
#                           restrict the loose rows; an aggregator is a loose
#                           `X.lean` with a sibling directory `X/` (default all)
#   cols=lines|files-lines  one numeric column (lines) or two (file count then
#                           line count, for directory-shaped tables)
#   desc=yes|no             emit the trailing hand-written column (default yes)
#   link=yes|no             render a subdirectory row as a link to its README
#                           when one exists (default no)
#   sort=name|lines-desc    row order (default name)
#
# The trailing column is HAND-WRITTEN and survives regeneration: rows are keyed
# on the file or directory name, so an existing description is carried across
# verbatim. A newly-appeared file gets `<!-- TODO: add description -->`; a row
# whose file no longer exists is dropped. A row naming a file outside the
# scanned directory (`../FormalSystem.lean`) is kept as a pinned row with its
# numbers refreshed, as long as the path still resolves.
#
# A table that is deliberately NOT generated -- one ordered by the layering rather
# than alphabetically, or carrying no counts at all -- registers itself instead with
#
#     <!-- INVENTORY: hand-maintained (dir=FormalSystem/Semantics) -->
#
# placed immediately above it. Registration buys exemption from generation, never
# from being checked: this mode still asserts that such a table has a row for every
# live file and subdirectory and no row for anything else.
#
# Two modes:
#   --emit-inventory           rewrite every registered block in place
#   --emit-inventory --check   exit non-zero if a rewrite would change a byte
#
# Only --check belongs in CI. The writer is a developer command.

# C25 compile-checks every `lean_exe` root declared in lakefile.lean. Those roots sit outside

# observe it. The repair landed in the same change that added this check, so all thirteen roots
# are green from its first run and it ships enforced with no soft period. Never flip it to 0 to

ENFORCE_C25=${ENFORCE_C25:-1} # every lean_exe root module compiles (enforced)
# C26 asserts, by reading the SOURCE TEXT rather than an imported environment, that no live
# `def` or `abbrev` carries an underscore inside its own name component, and that every in-source
# `nolint` attribute is on scripts/nolint-attribute-allowlist.txt. Both halves exist because
# `defsWithUnderscore` -- the env_linter C16 runs -- has four structural blind spots, each of
# which let the category reopen with every standing gate green. They are recorded in
# docs/development/NAMING_CONVENTION_DEVIATION.md and each is closed by a specific property of
# this check:
#   (1) OUT-OF-CLOSURE MODULES. `runLinter FormalSystem` observes only the FormalSystem library
#       closure. A module reachable only from a `lean_exe` root is never elaborated by it. C26
#       walks the TREE and consults no import closure at all, so such a module is as visible to
#       it as any other file.
#   (2) IN-SOURCE `nolint` ATTRIBUTES. An `attribute [nolint X] foo` produces no finding, so
#       there is nothing for runLinter, CI, a scripts/nolints.json baseline diff or C16 to count
#       -- unlike a JSON entry, which is at least a reviewable line. The second half below turns
#       every such attribute back into a line in a reviewable file.
#   (3) THE UPSTREAM `_1`/`_2`/`_mathlib` HEURISTIC. Mathlib's `isBadNameWithUnderscore` skips
#       any name whose last component ends in `_1`, `_2` or `_mathlib`, on the assumption that
#       such a name is an autogenerated instance. The exemption is invisible at the declaration
#       site. C26 deliberately does NOT inherit that heuristic.
#   (4) `private` DECLARATIONS. An env_linter reads a package by IMPORTING it, and a non-public
#       declaration is not exported to an importing module -- probed directly, the environment of
#       `import FormalSystem` holds zero non-auto private declarations from FormalSystem modules.
#       This is an upstream property of the observation mechanism, which Mathlib shares; it
#       cannot be fixed by configuring runLinter differently. A textual scan has no such blind
#       spot, so `private` declarations are in scope here.
# Ships ENFORCED with no soft window, on the C24/C25 precedent: both halves are green on the tree
# the day the check lands (zero flagged names, zero unlisted attributes), so a soft period would
# only be a window in which the invariant could regress unnoticed. Never flip it to 0 to quiet a
# failure: rename the declaration, or -- for an attribute -- add a reasoned entry to
# scripts/nolint-attribute-allowlist.txt, where the reason is read alongside the name it exempts.
ENFORCE_C26=${ENFORCE_C26:-1} # no snake_case def/abbrev, no unlisted nolint attribute (enforced)
# C16's second half widens the env_linter batch beyond the single `FormalSystem` library root to
# every root declared in lakefile.lean -- the other library root and all thirteen `lean_exe`
# roots -- because `runLinter FormalSystem` observes only the FormalSystem closure and a module
# reachable only from an exe root is invisible to it. That is the same blind spot C26's textual
# scan closes for declared names; this half is what closes it for shapes only ELABORATION can
# judge, above all auto-generated structure-field projections, where whether an underscored name
# is a violation depends on whether the field's type is a Prop.
# NOT YET ENFORCED, on a measurement rather than a preference: the widened target carries 179
# pre-existing findings today (see the C16 header for the per-root numbers), so enforcing it now
# would turn the gate red on work this check's own change does not own. It is computed and
# printed at every gate instead, on the ENFORCE_C9_DOCS model, so the debt is visible rather
# than either force-passed or blocking. Flip to 1 once the count reaches zero.

# C14: status-claim tripwires
#
# This is the check that closes the loop the rest of this script leaves open.
# C2 and C3 assert facts about the TREE; nothing asserted that `docs/` agrees
# with them. It has two halves:
#
#   (i)  a content scan for STALE literals -- an axiom count that is not 45, or a
#        table row documenting a non-zero sorry count. This half is cheap and
#        always runs. Its scope is docs/ + README.md + FormalSystem/**/*.lean:
#        the .lean half was added because C14's markdown-only scope is exactly
#        why SIX "42 axiom constructors" claims survived a 42 -> 45 change
#        untouched -- every one of them lived in a Lean docstring, where C14
#        could not see it. Lean doc comments are documentation and are in scope.
#   (ii) `#print axioms` for the two headline theorems that C2's four do not
#        cover, so that the decidability soundness bridge and RTime
#        completeness are pinned by the BUILD rather than by prose. This half
#        reuses C2's scratch-file + `lake env lean` machinery, including the
#        continuation-line rejoin, and skips under --no-build exactly as C2 does.
#
# The stale-literal patterns are deliberately narrow. A broad `[1-9]` scan over
# any line containing "sorry" produces false positives on prose that says the
# count is zero; the table-row shape is what actually carries a documented count.

# Scope note: `FormalSystem` is scanned for `*.lean` only, and Boneyard/ is excluded --
# archived modules are not documentation and are allowed to carry historical figures.
#
# WIDENING (both branches, kept identical so they cannot drift apart): the terminal
# word set gains `schema` (matches `schemata` too, since the pattern has no trailing

# "21 TM axiom schemas") is now tolerated between the count and the terminal word.

# somewhere on the line keeps the tripwire aimed at axiom-count claims. The markdown
# half above is deliberately left exactly as it was -- this is a widening of C14's
# scope, not a rewrite of its existing behavior.
#
# A second PRECISION guard (`grep -v -i covers`) was added alongside the first when

# C15: paper-anchor integrity
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS: 30 dangling paper-anchor citations accumulated in this tree
# across six paper editing waves, and not one of them was caught at write time.
# `lem:fibers` alone was cited 17 times after the paper deleted its `\label`.
# Nothing in this script asserted that a `def:`/`thm:`/`lem:`/`cor:`/`app:`/`rmk:`
# citation names an anchor that actually exists.
#
# RESOLUTION SOURCE IS THE RECORD, NOT THE PAPER. specs/paper-definitions-of-record.md
# is this repository's citation source of record (that is the record's own charter),
# and the paper lives in a different repository this one cannot see from CI. Resolving
# against the live .tex would make this check go red whenever the author edits the
# paper -- an event this repository does not control and cannot fix by editing itself.
# So a citation resolves if EITHER:
#
#   (a) it has a row in the record's machine-readable MANIFEST (a pinned anchor), or
#   (b) it has a row in the record's KNOWN-ANCHORS block, whose status is either
#       LIVE-UNPINNED (live in the paper, deliberately not pinned) or DANGLING
#       (retired, commented out, or never existed).
#
# Every anchor is therefore a RECORDED DECISION. An anchor with no row is either a
# typo or an undocumented citation, and both are defects.
#
# SCOPE is deliberate: specs/** is excluded (task artifacts routinely quote anchors
# that were live when they were written, and rewriting history is not the goal), and
# FormalSystem/Boneyard/ is excluded (archived modules are frozen). What remains is
# live, load-bearing scope: FormalSystem/ (non-Boneyard), Tests/, typst/, docs/,
# and README.md.

# C15, second assertion: every theorem-index row is anchored at its declaration
#
# `docs/theorem-index.md` is the repository's single per-theorem ledger, and its
# Paper-label column is only as good as the declaration sites it claims to describe.
# This asserts the round trip: for every row, the named declaration's own `/--` doc
# comment carries a `Paper:` line whose value is either the row's anchor or the
# literal `—` followed by a one-clause reason. `—` is a satisfied cell, not a gap:
# compactness, non-compactness, consequence completeness, the conservativity bridge
# and the expressiveness results are the formalization's own and have no paper
# counterpart to cite.
#
# Structurally INDEPENDENT of the anchor-resolution loop above, and reported
# separately, so that a failure here is never confused with an unresolved anchor and
# neither half can make the other unrunnable.

# C20: file.lean:NNN citations -- two tiers
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS: a `Foo.lean:123` citation is a pointer that rots the moment
# anything above line 123 is edited, and nothing noticed. Measured when this check
# was written: 1,354 such citations in live scope, of which 118 point at a line that
# does not exist or at a blank line. The standing convention is to cite the
# DECLARATION NAME, never file:line -- a name survives every edit that a line number
# does not.
#
# Two tiers, because the two halves have very different costs:
#
#   Tier 1 (GATED, repo-wide live scope). A citation whose target line is out of
#   range, or lands on a blank line, is provably wrong. Machine-detectable, so
#   machine-fixable, so gated everywhere.
#
#   Tier 2 (reported; gated only under ENFORCE_C20=1). ANY file:line citation in
#   publication-facing scope -- README.md, docs/, typst/, every README.md under
#   FormalSystem/, and the aggregators and top-level modules of FormalSystem/,
#   Metalogic/ and Semantics/. These are the surfaces a paper reader and doc-gen4
#   actually land on. `FormalSystem/Metalogic/WeakCanonical/**` is deliberately
#   EXCLUDED from tier 2: its ~1,080 citations are internal proof-engineering
#   navigation notes between files a referee never opens, and gating them would turn
#   a documentation nicety into a thousand-site refactor with real regression risk.
#   They are still covered by tier 1.
#
# A citation whose filename resolves to several live files, or to none (an archived
# path, say), is reported as unverifiable rather than failed: the check will not
# guess which file was meant.

# C16: environment linters (defsWithUnderscore, docBlame, simpNF, structureInType,
# tacticDocs, unusedArguments, ...) via the configured lintDriver
#
# `lake exe runLinter FormalSystem` runs Batteries' full env_linter suite -- the same
# one `lintDriver := "batteries/runLinter"` wires into `lake lint`/CI -- and reads
# scripts/nolints.json unconditionally, filtering out every declaration recorded
# there before deciding pass/fail. nolints.json grandfathers 217 findings, all of them
# `unusedArguments` -- the sole permanently-grandfathered category, on the measured
# evidence recorded in docs/development/NAMING_CONVENTION_DEVIATION.md. A clean run
# here therefore means "no NEW finding since the grandfather baseline", mirroring CI's
# own `lake lint` gate exactly -- this is the local equivalent of that check. Never
# regenerate nolints.json to make a genuine regression disappear: `--update` rewrites
# the file wholesale from current findings and would grandfather the regression along
# with everything else. To retire a category, fix it and remove its rows with a `jq`
# filter, then prove the removal with a green `lake exe runLinter FormalSystem`.
#
# `dupNamespace` is deliberately NOT part of this batch (it is a separate Lean-core
# text linter, not a Batteries @[env_linter], and never appears in runLinter's
# output regardless of its true count). Isolating it via the REAL linter requires
# `lake lint --builtin-only --lint-only .dupNamespace`, which forces Lake to
# rebuild the ENTIRE default target under different linter options on every
# single invocation (confirmed during this check's own development: roughly ten
# minutes, and OOM-killed once) -- unsustainable for a routinely-run script.
#
# Instead, dupNamespace's condition is checked TEXTUALLY below, reporting-only:
# it fires when a declaration's own name repeats a component of its enclosing
# `namespace`, so a plain scan tracking `namespace`/`section`/`end` nesting and
# flagging any `structure`/`inductive`/`def`/`abbrev`/`theorem`/`instance`/`class`
# whose name (plus, for a `structure`/`class`, its auto-generated field
# projections and `.mk` constructor) repeats an open segment reproduces the real
# linter's verdict closely, in milliseconds, with no build. This is intentionally
# an approximation (it will miss `to_additive`-style generated names, and
# multi-line/attribute-heavy declarations are best-effort) -- acceptable because
# this half is reporting-only. For a cheap cross-check against the REAL linter,
# `lake env lean <file>` re-elaborates a single file against the existing oleans in
# roughly two seconds, runs `dupNamespace` for real, and writes no oleans -- a
# different route entirely from the ~10-minute full-rebuild
# `lake lint --builtin-only --lint-only .dupNamespace` path described above, and the
# one to reach for when this scanner's verdict on a file needs confirming. A
# HARDCODED count was deliberately
# rejected here: this script exists in part to catch hand-typed numbers drifting
# from the tree (see C14), so freezing dupNamespace's count would be the same
# defect class in miniature.
#
# THE LINTER TARGET, AND WHY IT IS NO LONGER JUST `FormalSystem`.
#
# `runLinter <Module>` observes a package by IMPORTING it, so `runLinter FormalSystem` sees
# exactly the FormalSystem library closure and nothing else. Every `lean_exe` root sits outside
# that closure, and so does the `BimodalTest` library root -- the same structural gap C25 exists
# to close for compilation, unclosed for linting. It is not hypothetical: 20 live
# `defsWithUnderscore` findings sit in an out-of-closure module today (auto-generated
# projections of one `structure` whose fields are snake_case and data-valued), and
# `runLinter FormalSystem` reports 0 in the same breath.
#
# MEASURED BEFORE DECIDING. `lake exe runLinter <Module>` accepts any module name, library root
# or exe root alike. Sweeping all fifteen roots with the tree already built by C1 -- which is
# the position this check runs in -- costs 44s wall clock and reports:
#
#     FormalSystem 0   ProofStepExport 0   BenchmarkAnchors 0   TableauProofStepPipeline 0
#     ProofFirstExporter 0   DatasetValidator 1   CheckInitImports 1   EnumBenchmark 4
#     TraceExporter 5   BenchmarkOracle 9   TableauBridge 12   MachineAppendixExport 16
#     DatasetExport 32   BimodalTest 85
#
# -- 179 findings outside the `FormalSystem` root, of which 56 are `defsWithUnderscore`
# (DatasetExport 20, BimodalTest 36) and the rest are docBlame/unusedArguments-class.
#
# THE DECISION: widen, but REPORTING-ONLY, behind ENFORCE_C16_ROOTS, which defaults to 0. The
# scope is not clean, so enforcing it would hold the gate hostage to a burndown this change does
# not own; abandoning the widening would leave the elaboration-only shapes with no instrument at
# all. Reporting it prints the debt at every gate, which is the ENFORCE_C9_DOCS pattern and the
# reason that pattern exists. The first half above -- `runLinter FormalSystem` against
# scripts/nolints.json -- stays ENFORCED and unchanged; this half neither relaxes it nor
# depends on it, and no existing ENFORCE_ flag was flipped to accommodate the widening.

# C17: dead-declaration scan (reporting-only)
#
# Numbering note: the review's own text calls this check "C16", which collides
# with this file's C16 (the environment-linter batch above). The delegation's
# mapping supersedes the review's label: C17 = D-16 (this check), C18 = E-13
# (paragraph duplication, below).
#
# For each declaration in non-Boneyard FormalSystem/**/*.lean, the BASE
# identifier (the last dot-segment of its name -- e.g. `c0` for `Chronicle.c0`,
# matching how dot notation and an `open` namespace actually reference it) is
# tokenised and counted across every `.lean` file in FormalSystem/ and Tests/
# plus every `.md` file in the repo (excluding .git/.lake/specs/Boneyard/
# build/__pycache__, the same scope C5 already uses for markdown). A
# declaration whose base identifier occurs nowhere else -- not even on another
# line of its own file -- is reported as a candidate dead declaration.
#
# This is reporting-only and deliberately approximate, same spirit as C16's
# dupNamespace check: it is blind to attribute/simp-set-driven indirect usage
# (a theorem tagged `@[formula_unfold]` and consumed only via `simp only
# [formula_unfold]` elsewhere is textually "dead" by this scan but is not
# actually unused), to `to_additive`-generated names, and to same-named
# declarations in different namespaces (a shared base name like `mk` or
# `toString` will never register as dead, which is the safe direction of
# error for a census that must never gate). No ENFORCE_C17 flag -- reporting-
# only per the delegation, and an unused enforcement flag invites a later
# unreviewed flip.

# instance) in non-Boneyard FormalSystem/**/*.lean. `lemma` is G-12's one
# deliberate addition to the review's own keyword list. The baseline is G-12's
# heuristic, not D-15's 91.8% "core scope" figure -- G-12's is the only one with
# a named, re-runnable method (see this task's plan Overview for the full
# rationale); D-15's baseline is explicitly NOT used here.
#
# TWO figures are computed and both are reported, so a future reader can see
# that the number moved because the definition of "documented" was widened, not
# because coverage itself changed:
#
#   (i)  UNREFINED (G-12 exactly as specified): a declaration counts as
#        documented iff a `/-- ... -/` doc comment ends within the three lines
#        immediately above it. Measured 89.37% (10427 total, 1108 undocumented)
#        -- under the 90% floor.
#   (ii) REFINED (this check's reported figure): (i), OR the declaration falls
#        within the scope of the nearest preceding `/-! ... -/` section
#        comment. That scope begins immediately after the section comment's
#        own closing `-/` and ends at the EARLIEST of: another `/-!` comment
#        opening, a `namespace`/`section`/`end` command, a declaration that is
#        itself (i)-documented (the author explicitly labelled a new unit, so
#        the ambient section's credit ends there), or end of file. Measured
#        92.32% (9626 documented) -- clears the floor.
#
# The refinement was authorized (not assumed) after the unrefined figure was
# found under 90%: this blind spot was already documented as a KNOWN, ANTICIPATED
# limitation of G-12's heuristic ("under-reports coverage for declarations
# documented by an enclosing /-! -/ section comment") before this check existed,
# not a new discovery invented to clear the floor. It was applied ONCE as a
# single, precisely-specified rule and measured once -- not iterated toward a
# target. Verified in both directions before adoption: (a) manually inspecting 8
# of the ORIGINAL undocumented hits confirmed they were genuinely covered by an
# enclosing section, not actually undocumented; (b) manually inspecting several
# NEWLY-credited hits after a first draft of the rule found real over-crediting
# (a section header 664 lines away crediting an unrelated theorem deep in an
# 11000-line file with no intervening boundary) -- the "ends at the next
# (i)-documented declaration too" clause was added specifically to close that
# gap, and the largest remaining credited gap (241 lines, in
# WeakCanonical/GroupModel/MonoDiscrete.lean) was re-checked and found genuine:
# the section header explicitly names every theorem in the batch it covers.
#
# Per-keyword rates worth carrying into a documentation follow-up task
# regardless of the aggregate clearing the floor: class 16.3%, instance 57.6%,
# lemma 55.6% (all measured against the unrefined figures; these three
# categories are real, small-sample documentation gaps, not artifacts of either
# heuristic).
#
# Reporting-only: never increments FAILURES, no ENFORCE_C19 flag. No build
# invocation; runs under --no-build like C17/C18.

# linter options, `set_option` defaults and common tactic imports are meant to be
# inherited. That guarantee is worth exactly as much as its weakest module -- a
# file with no path to `Init` silently opts out of every option the root sets, and
# nothing about a green build reveals it. This check is what makes the root's
# promise an invariant rather than a convention.
#
# `lake exe checkInitImports` reads the real import graph out of the compiled
# environment (`CoreM.withImportModules #[`FormalSystem]` plus ImportGraph's
# transitive closure), not out of the text of the `import` lines, so it sees
# inheritance through intermediate modules exactly as Lean does. The property is
# carried by the eleven minimal elements of the internal DAG -- the modules with no
# `FormalSystem.*` import of their own -- so the tree satisfies this with eleven
# import lines, not one per module.
#
# Ships ENFORCED, with no soft period, and this is deliberate: unlike C8/C9/C10,
# whose debt was still outstanding the day they were written, the adoption work
# landed in the same change as this block, so the check is green from its first
# run. A soft period here would only create a window in which the invariant could
# regress unnoticed. Never flip ENFORCE_C24 to 0 to quiet a failure -- add the
# missing import at the offending module's own minimal element instead, or, if the
# module genuinely cannot depend on `FormalSystem.*` (the `ForMathlib` upstreaming
# rule is the one live instance), record it in `exceptions` in
# scripts/CheckInitImports.lean with its reason written beside it.

# closure walk never reaches it either. C6's rot guard does not cover them either --
# C6 seeds its reachability walk from every `root :=` in this same lakefile, so an
# exe root is *reachable* by C6's definition and listing one in
# scripts/module-invariants-manifest.txt trips C6's stale-manifest branch instead of
# covering it. That is the wrong mechanism; this check is the right one, and the
# manifest must not gain an exe-root line.
#
# The gap was not hypothetical. FormalSystem/Automation/ProofStepExport.lean -- the
# `proof_extractor` root -- failed to elaborate for an extended period with three
# `Application type mismatch` errors masking a further 873, and no gate anywhere in
# the repository was able to observe it. `lake exe proof_extractor` was simply
# broken, and the tree was green.

# reachability block uses, so a newly declared `lean_exe` is covered the day it is
# added and there is no second list to forget to update. An empty scrape is a
# failure, not a silent pass: it means the regex or the lakefile's shape changed.
#
# Module targets, never exe targets. `lake build <root>` elaborates and emits C
# without linking; `lake exe <name>` would link a 240-310 MB binary per root, and

# C26: snake_case `def`/`abbrev` names, and in-source `nolint` attributes
#
# The four blind spots this closes are enumerated at ENFORCE_C26 above. What follows is
# how the scan itself is built, and every exemption in it with its reason.
#
# SCOPE: every live `*.lean` file under FormalSystem/, via the same `Boneyard`-pruning walk
# C16's textual half uses. No import closure is consulted anywhere in this block -- that is
# precisely what makes an out-of-closure module and a `private` declaration visible.
#
# DECLARATION KINDS: `def` and `abbrev` only.
#   -- `theorem` is excluded because snake_case is the CORRECT Mathlib convention for a
#      proposition, and the upstream linter's own `isDefinition` guard excludes it too.
#   -- `instance` is excluded on measured evidence, not on taste. All 23 live snake_case
#      `instance` declarations were probed by elaboration against the built oleans, and every
#      one of them is recorded by Lean as a `thmInfo`, not a `defnInfo` -- they are Prop-valued
#      instances, for which snake_case is again the correct convention, and which is exactly why
#      `defsWithUnderscore` never fires on them. A scan that did not exempt `instance` would
#      start life red on 23 conformant names. RESIDUAL, stated rather than hidden: a
#      data-valued (`Type`-valued) `instance` with an underscored name would be a genuine
#      violation and this exemption would miss it. There are none today; the reporting-only
#      env_linter sweep over every lakefile root (C16, second half) is what would see one,
#      because that half elaborates and can tell a `defnInfo` from a `thmInfo`.
#   -- STRUCTURE FIELDS are likewise out of scope for this textual half, and this is the same
#      distinction again. Lean turns each field into a projection `def`, so a data-valued field
#      with an underscored name IS a `defsWithUnderscore` violation -- 20 live ones exist, all
#      auto-generated projections of one `structure` in an out-of-closure module. But 188
#      structure fields tree-wide are textually snake_case and the overwhelming majority are
#      Prop-valued, hence theorems, hence correctly named: `runLinter FormalSystem` reports zero
#      on all of them. Prop-ness is not decidable from the source text, so flagging fields here
#      would be 188 findings to catch 20. Field-shaped violations are assigned to the
#      elaboration-based sweep instead, where the distinction is free.
#
# VISIBILITY: `private` declarations are IN scope. This is blind spot (4), and it is the one
# thing no env_linter can ever do.
#
# NAMING RULE, deliberately not `isBadNameWithUnderscore`: strip a leading `_root_.`, take the
# last dot-component, and flag it when it contains an underscore that is not in TRAILING
# position. Flagging a name whose last component ends `_1`/`_2`/`_mathlib` is blind spot (3).
# Not flagging a purely TRAILING underscore is a required carve-out, not a softening: `true` and
# `false` are keywords, so `MonadicFormula.true_` and `MonadicFormula.false_`
# (Metalogic/WeakCanonical/MonadicFO.lean) disambiguate by suffix and are correct as written.
# Those two names are the measured reason the rule reads "not trailing" rather than "no
# underscore at all".
#
# Runs regardless of --no-build: it reads source text and needs no oleans, exactly as C16's
# textual half and C23 do.
