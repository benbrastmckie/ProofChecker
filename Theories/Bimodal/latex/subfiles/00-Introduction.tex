\section{Introduction}

\textbf{TM} is a bimodal logic combining S5 a historical necessity operator ($\nec$) with linear temporal operators for past ($\allpast$) and future ($\allfuture$).
The logic provides a framework for reasoning about necessary truths across time to train AI systems to reason about past and future contingency.

The semantics is based on \emph{task frames}, which extend Kripke frames with temporal structure.
A task frame consists of world states connected by a \emph{task relation} indexed by temporal durations.
World histories are temporal slices through a task frame, representing the unfolding of a world over time.

  % Draw the marked point P on top
  \node[point] at (P) {};
  \node[below right, font=\small] at (P) {$w$};

  % Labels for the cones

\noindent
The diagram above illustrates the conceptual structure underlying TM logic.
The solid curve represents a single world history---a temporal sequence of states.
From any point $w$ along a history, the past and future light cones contain all states that are modally accessible.
The necessity operator $\nec$ quantifies over all histories passing through $w$, while the temporal operators $\allpast$ and $\allfuture$ quantify along the single actual history.
The dotted lines represent counterfactual paths: alternative pasts that could have led to $w$, and alternative futures that could unfold from $w$.

\subsection*{Project Structure}

The Lean 4 implementation is in the \texttt{Bimodal/} directory:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{Syntax/} -- Defines the formula language with 6 primitive constructors and derived operators.
  \textbf{Complete.}
  \item \texttt{ProofSystem/} -- Axioms (14 schemata) and inference rules (7 rules) forming a Hilbert-style proof system.
  \textbf{Complete.}
  \item \texttt{Semantics/} -- Task frames model possible worlds; world histories model time; truth conditions define meaning.
  \textbf{Complete.}
  \item \texttt{Metalogic/} -- Soundness theorem (proven: all axioms valid, rules preserve validity), deduction theorem (proven: enables assumption introduction), and completeness infrastructure (Lindenbaum lemma, canonical model axiomatized).
  \textbf{Soundness and deduction complete; completeness pending.}
  \item \texttt{Theorems/} -- Perpetuity principles and modal theorems derived from the axiom system.
  \textbf{Partial.}
\end{itemize}
