\section{Introduction}

The bimodal logic \textbf{TM} combines an S5 historical modal operators ($\nec$) with linear temporal operators for past ($\allpast$) and future ($\allfuture$).
The logic provides a framework for modal and temporal reasoning, providing a positive RL signal to train AI systems in verified reason about past and future contingency.

The semantics is based on \emph{task frames}, which extend Kripke frames with a non-deterministic transition relation parameterized by durations.
A task frame consists of world states connected by a \emph{task relation} indexed by temporal durations.
World histories are temporal slices through a task frame, representing the unfolding of a world over time.

\noindent
The diagram above illustrates the conceptual structure underlying TM logic.
The solid curve $\tau$ represents a single world history---a temporal sequence of states.
From any point $x$ along a history, the past and future light cones contain all states that are modally accessible.
The necessity operator $\nec$ quantifies over all histories passing through $x$, while the temporal operators $\allpast$ and $\allfuture$ quantify along the single actual history.
The dotted lines represent counterfactual paths: alternative pasts that could have led to $x$, and alternative futures that could unfold from $x$.

\subsection*{Project Structure}

The Lean 4 implementation is in the \texttt{Bimodal/} directory:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{Syntax/} -- Defines the formula language with 6 primitive constructors and derived operators.
  \textbf{Complete.}
  \item \texttt{ProofSystem/} -- Axioms (14 schemata) and inference rules (7 rules) forming a Hilbert-style proof system.
  \textbf{Complete.}
  \item \texttt{Semantics/} -- Task frames model possible worlds; world histories model time; truth conditions define meaning.
  \textbf{Complete.}
  \item \texttt{Metalogic/} -- Soundness theorem (proven: all axioms valid, rules preserve validity), deduction theorem (proven: enables assumption introduction), and completeness via the semantic canonical model (Lindenbaum lemma proven, truth lemma proven, weak completeness proven).
  \textbf{Soundness, deduction, and semantic completeness established.}
  \item \texttt{Theorems/} -- Perpetuity principles and modal theorems derived from the axiom system.
  \textbf{Partial.}
\end{itemize}
