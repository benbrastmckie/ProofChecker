# Cantor Isomorphism Application

This module applies Cantor's theorem (`Order.iso_of_countable_dense`) to the
dense staged timeline to establish an order isomorphism with the rationals Q.

## Overview

The dense timeline (from DenseTimeline.lean) is a countable, dense, linearly
preordered set without endpoints. The Antisymmetrization (quotient by mutual
CanonicalR) gives a proper LinearOrder. Cantor's uniqueness theorem then
provides an order isomorphism T ≃o Q.

## Key Types and Theorems

- `DenseTimelineElem`: subtype of StagedPoints in the dense timeline union
- `TimelineQuot`: antisymmetrization of the timeline (has LinearOrder)
- `cantor_iso`: Nonempty (TimelineQuot ≃o ℚ)

## Dense Timeline Element Type

The elements of the dense timeline, as a subtype of StagedPoint.
-/

/-- A point in the dense timeline union. -/
def DenseTimelineElem : Type :=
  { p : StagedPoint // p ∈ denseTimelineUnion root_mcs root_mcs_proof }

## Preorder on Dense Timeline Elements

The preorder uses StagedPoint.le: a ≤ b iff a.mcs = b.mcs ∨ CanonicalR a.mcs b.mcs.
-/

/-- Preorder instance for dense timeline elements. -/
noncomputable instance : Preorder (DenseTimelineElem root_mcs root_mcs_proof) where
  le a b := StagedPoint.le a.1 b.1
  le_refl a := StagedPoint.le_refl a.1
  le_trans a b c hab hbc := StagedPoint.le_trans a.1 b.1 c.1 hab hbc

/-- The preorder on dense timeline elements is total. -/
instance : IsTotal (DenseTimelineElem root_mcs root_mcs_proof) (· ≤ ·) where
  total a b := denseTimeline_linearly_ordered root_mcs root_mcs_proof a.1 b.1 a.2 b.2

## Timeline Quotient (Antisymmetrization)

The antisymmetrization quotients by the equivalence a ~ b iff a ≤ b ∧ b ≤ a.
This gives a partial order. Combined with totality, it gives a linear order.

## Cantor Prerequisites for TimelineQuot

We need: Countable, DenselyOrdered, NoMinOrder, NoMaxOrder, Nonempty.

/-- The timeline quotient is countable. -/
instance : Countable (TimelineQuot root_mcs root_mcs_proof) := by
  -- TimelineQuot is a quotient of DenseTimelineElem
  -- DenseTimelineElem is a subtype of StagedPoint
  -- StagedPoint has at most countably many values (each is an MCS + stage)
  -- The dense timeline union is countable
  have h_countable := dense_timeline_countable root_mcs root_mcs_proof
  -- DenseTimelineElem is countable (subtype of a countable set)

      -- In LinearOrder from Antisymmetrization, a < b means a ≤ b ∧ ¬(b ≤ a)
      -- at the quotient level.
      -- We know CanonicalR(p.mcs, q.mcs), so p ≤ q'. But we also need ¬(q' ≤ p).
      -- q' ≤ p means q.mcs = p.mcs ∨ CanonicalR(q.mcs, p.mcs).
      -- These might hold (mutual CanonicalR). In that case, p and q' are in the
      -- same equivalence class, and their quotients are equal, not p < q'.
      --
      -- The issue: staged_timeline_has_future gives q with CanonicalR(p, q),
      -- but possibly also CanonicalR(q, p). In that case, [p] = [q'] in the quotient.
      --
      -- We need a STRICT future: CanonicalR(p, q) and NOT CanonicalR(q, p).
      -- The current dense_timeline_has_future doesn't guarantee strictness.
      --
      -- Fix: we need to find q with StagedPoint.lt p q (strict).
