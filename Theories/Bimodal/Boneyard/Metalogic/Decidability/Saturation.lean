# Tableau Saturation and Expansion

This module implements the saturation process for tableau branches and
the main tableau expansion algorithm with termination guarantees.

## Main Definitions

- `ExpandedTableau`: Result type for fully expanded tableaux
- `expandToCompletion`: Expand a branch until closed or saturated
- `buildTableau`: Build complete tableau for a formula

## Termination

Termination is guaranteed by the subformula property: tableau expansion
only produces formulas from the subformula closure of the initial branch.
The total complexity decreases with each expansion step.

## Expanded Tableau Type
-/

/--
A fully expanded tableau has all branches either closed or saturated.

- `allClosed`: All branches closed → formula is valid
- `hasOpen`: At least one saturated open branch → formula is invalid
-/
inductive ExpandedTableau : Type where
  /-- All branches are closed (formula is valid). -/
  | allClosed (closedBranches : List ClosedBranch)
  /-- At least one branch is open/saturated (formula is invalid). -/
  | hasOpen (openBranch : Branch) (saturated : findUnexpanded openBranch = none)
  deriving Repr

namespace ExpandedTableau

/-- Check if the tableau shows the formula is valid. -/
def isValid : ExpandedTableau → Bool
  | allClosed _ => true
  | hasOpen _ _ => false

/-- Check if the tableau shows the formula is invalid. -/
def isInvalid : ExpandedTableau → Bool
  | allClosed _ => false
  | hasOpen _ _ => true

end ExpandedTableau

## Branch List Operations
-/

/--
Result of expanding a list of branches.
-/
inductive BranchListResult : Type where
  /-- All branches closed. -/
  | allClosed (closedBranches : List ClosedBranch)
  /-- Found an open saturated branch. -/
  | foundOpen (openBranch : Branch) (saturated : findUnexpanded openBranch = none)
  /-- Still have branches to process. -/

## Fuel-Based Expansion
-/

/--
Expand a single branch until closed or saturated.
Uses fuel to ensure termination (refinement of well-founded approach).

Returns:
- `some (inl closedBranch)`: Branch closed
- `some (inr openBranch)`: Branch saturated (open)
- `none`: Ran out of fuel
-/
def expandBranchWithFuel (b : Branch) (fuel : Nat) : Option (ClosedBranch ⊕ Branch) :=
  match fuel with
  | 0 => none  -- Out of fuel
  | fuel + 1 =>
      -- First check if already closed
      match findClosure b with
      | some reason => some (.inl ⟨b, reason⟩)
      | none =>
          -- Try to expand
          match expandOnce b with
          | .saturated => some (.inr b)  -- Open saturated branch
          | .extended newBranch => expandBranchWithFuel newBranch fuel
          | .split branches =>
              -- For a split, we check if ALL branches close
              -- If any branch stays open, we return that open branch
              -- This is a simplification - full implementation would track all branches
              let tryBranch := fun acc newBranch =>
                match acc with
                | some (.inr openBr) => some (.inr openBr)  -- Already found open
                | _ =>
                    match expandBranchWithFuel newBranch fuel with
                    | none => none  -- Out of fuel
                    | some (.inl _) => acc  -- This branch closed, continue
                    | some (.inr openBr) => some (.inr openBr)  -- Found open
              branches.foldl tryBranch (some (.inl ⟨b, .botPos⟩))  -- Dummy initial closed
termination_by fuel

/--
Expand multiple branches until all closed or one is found open.
Uses fuel to ensure termination.

Returns:
- `allClosed`: All branches closed (formula valid)
- `foundOpen`: Found saturated open branch (formula invalid)
- `pending`: Ran out of fuel with branches remaining
-/
def expandBranchesWithFuel (branches : List Branch) (fuel : Nat)
    (closed : List ClosedBranch := []) : BranchListResult :=
  match branches with
  | [] => .allClosed closed
  | b :: rest =>
      match expandBranchWithFuel b fuel with
      | none => .pending (b :: rest)  -- Out of fuel
      | some (.inl closedBr) => expandBranchesWithFuel rest fuel (closedBr :: closed)
      | some (.inr openBr) =>
          -- Check if open branch is saturated
          match h : findUnexpanded openBr with
          | none => .foundOpen openBr h

## Main Expansion Function
-/

/--
Build a complete tableau for proving ¬φ is unsatisfiable (i.e., φ is valid).

Starts with F(φ) (asserting φ is false) and expands until:
- All branches close → φ is valid
- Some branch saturates open → φ is invalid

Uses fuel parameter for termination. The fuel should be set based on
the formula's complexity.
-/
def buildTableau (φ : Formula) (fuel : Nat := 1000) : Option ExpandedTableau :=
  let initialBranch : Branch := [SignedFormula.neg φ]
  match expandBranchWithFuel initialBranch fuel with
  | none => none  -- Out of fuel
  | some (.inl closedBr) => some (.allClosed [closedBr])
  | some (.inr openBr) =>
      match h : findUnexpanded openBr with
      | none => some (.hasOpen openBr h)
      | some _ => none  -- Should be saturated but isn't

/--
Recommended fuel based on formula complexity.
Uses 10 * complexity as a heuristic upper bound.
-/
def recommendedFuel (φ : Formula) : Nat :=
  10 * φ.complexity + 100

/--
Build tableau with automatic fuel calculation.
-/
def buildTableauAuto (φ : Formula) : Option ExpandedTableau :=
  buildTableau φ (recommendedFuel φ)

/-!
## Saturation Properties
-/

/--
Check if a branch is fully saturated (all formulas expanded).
-/
def isSaturated (b : Branch) : Bool :=
  (findUnexpanded b).isNone

/--
A saturated branch contains only atomic signed formulas
(atoms, bot, or modal/temporal operators that can't be further expanded).
-/
def isAtomicBranch (b : Branch) : Bool :=
  b.all fun sf =>
    match sf.formula with
    | .atom _ => true
    | .bot => true
    | _ => isExpanded sf

/-!
## Termination Measure
-/

/--
Termination measure for branch expansion.
Sum of unexpanded complexities decreases with each rule application.
-/
def expansionMeasure (b : Branch) : Nat :=
  b.foldl (fun acc sf =>
    if isExpanded sf then acc
    else acc + sf.formula.complexity) 0

/--
Expansion decreases the measure (for non-saturated branches).
This is the key lemma for termination of the tableau procedure.
-/
theorem expansion_decreases_measure (b : Branch) (h : ¬isSaturated b) :
    ∀ b', (expandOnce b = .extended b' ∨
           ∃ bs, expandOnce b = .split bs ∧ b' ∈ bs) →
    expansionMeasure b' < expansionMeasure b := by
  sorry  -- Technical proof: rule application decomposes formulas

## Tableau Statistics
-/

/--
Statistics about a tableau expansion.

  /-- Number of branches created. -/
