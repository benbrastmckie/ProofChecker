## Documents

### Proof Search Automation

#### MODAL_TEMPORAL_PROOF_SEARCH.md

Unified proof search architecture for modal and temporal logics. Covers tableau methods, sequent
calculi, and specialized strategies for box/diamond and past/future operators.

**Status**: Research complete

#### PROOF_SEARCH_AUTOMATION.md

General proof search automation strategies including best-first search, priority queues, proof
caching, and memoization techniques for modal and temporal proof systems.

**Status**: Research complete

#### temporal-logic-automation-research.md

Research on temporal logic proof automation techniques, including LTL proof methods, tableau-based
decision procedures, and adaptation strategies for bimodal temporal logic.

**Status**: Research complete

### LeanSearch Integration

#### LEANSEARCH_API_SPECIFICATION.md

API specification for LeanSearch integration, documenting REST API endpoints, query parameters,
response formats, and integration strategies for proof search automation.

**Status**: Research complete

#### leansearch-best-first-search.md

Best-first search algorithm design for LeanSearch-based proof automation, including heuristic
evaluation, search space management, and termination criteria.

**Status**: Research complete

#### leansearch-priority-queue.md

Priority queue implementation strategies for proof search, covering heap-based queues, priority
scoring, and integration with proof search automation.

**Status**: Research complete

#### leansearch-proof-caching-memoization.md

Proof caching and memoization design for avoiding redundant proof searches, including cache
invalidation strategies and memory management.

**Status**: Research complete
