# Core Formula Syntax

This module defines the formula syntax for the Explanatory Extension layer.
These formulas are evaluated relative to world-histories and times.

## Paper Specification Reference

**Explanatory Extension Syntax (recursive-semantics.md)**:
The Explanatory Extension interprets these additional syntactic primitives:
- Modal operators: □ (necessity), ◇ (possibility)
- Temporal operators: H (always past), G (always future), P (some past), F (some future)
- Extended temporal operators: ◁ (since), ▷ (until)
- Counterfactual conditional: □→ (would-counterfactual)
- Causal operator: ○→ (causation)
- Store/recall operators: ↑ⁱ (store), ↓ⁱ (recall)
- Universal quantification: ∀x.A

## Main Definitions

- `Formula`: Full formula type with all Explanatory Extension operators
- Derived operators: ◇, P, F, ◇→, ○→, always (△), sometimes (▽)

## Implementation Notes

Formulas embed ConstitutiveFormula from the Foundation layer and add
the modal, temporal, counterfactual, and indexed reference operators.
