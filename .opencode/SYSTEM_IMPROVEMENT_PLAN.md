  - lean-research-agent.md
  - atomic-task-numberer.md

**Analysis Results**:
- ❌ update.md - Does not exist in ProofChecker project (OpenAgents only)
- ✅ meta.md - Backup references are documentation only, not actual code
  - Lines 115-116: User-facing warning message
  - Line 141: Configuration variable (backup_path)
  - No actual backup creation code in this file
  - Actual backup would be in meta-builder-orchestrator (OpenAgents project)
  - **Decision**: Intentionally preserved for /meta command (system replacement safety)
- ✅ system-builder subagents - No backup creation code found
  - Searched all 5 subagents: context-organizer, domain-analyzer, command-creator, workflow-designer, agent-generator
  - None create backup files or directories

**Cleanup Note**:
- Existing backup files (registry.json.backup.*) are from OpenAgents project, not ProofChecker
- No cleanup needed in ProofChecker project
- All .bak file creation removed from regular file operations
- Git-based safety commits now used throughout system

### Phase 5 Deliverables ✅ (Complete - Context loading standardized)

  - Already consolidated in Task 246 (72% reduction achieved)
  
- ✅ Updated all 16 subagents with standardized context_loading frontmatter:
  - **Core subagents**: implementer.md, planner.md, researcher.md, reviewer.md, task-executor.md
  - **Utility subagents**: status-sync-manager.md, git-workflow-manager.md, error-diagnostics-agent.md, atomic-task-numberer.md
  - **Lean subagents**: lean-implementation-agent.md, lean-research-agent.md
  - **Builder subagents**: agent-generator.md, command-creator.md, context-organizer.md, domain-analyzer.md, workflow-designer.md
  - All now reference consolidated files:
    - `core/standards/delegation.md` (replaces subagent-return-format.md)
    - `core/system/state-management.md` (replaces status-markers.md, state-schema.md)
    - `common/system/artifact-management.md`
    - `common/system/git-commits.md`
    
- ✅ Verified no explicit "Context Loaded:" sections in commands
  - All 9 commands already use frontmatter context_loading
  - No cleanup needed
  
**Impact**:
- Consistent context loading across all 16 subagents
- All agents reference consolidated context files (72% smaller)
- Clear separation: frontmatter defines what to load, no inline loading
- Performance improvement: agents load only required context

### Phase 6 Deliverables ✅ (Complete - Architecture already properly separated)

**Analysis**:
- ✅ Process context files already exist from Phase 1:
  - `implementation-workflow.md` (detailed implementation process)
  - `planning-workflow.md` (detailed planning process)
  - `research-workflow.md` (detailed research process)
  
- ✅ Commands have appropriate routing workflows (6 stages each):
  - Preflight: Parse and validate
  - CheckLanguage/CheckPlan: Determine routing
  - Delegate: Route to subagent
  - ValidateReturn: Check subagent response
  - ReturnSuccess: Relay to user
  - Commands are routing-focused, not implementation-focused
  
- ✅ Subagents have detailed implementation workflows:
  - implementer.md: 7-step detailed implementation process
  - planner.md: Multi-stage planning workflow
  - researcher.md: Comprehensive research workflow
  - All subagents own their execution logic
  
**Architecture Verification**:
- Commands: 297-878 lines (routing + validation + error handling)
- Subagents: Detailed implementation workflows
- Context files: Reference documentation
- Separation of concerns: ✅ Properly maintained

**Conclusion**:
Phase 6 objectives already achieved. Architecture properly separates:
- Routing (commands)
- Execution (subagents)
- Documentation (context files)

## Executive Summary

This plan systematically improves the ProofChecker/.opencode/ agent system by:
1. **Standardizing XML structure** across all commands and orchestrator
2. **Removing backup files** in favor of git-based safety
3. **Optimizing context loading** for consistency and performance
4. **Refactoring architecture** to move workflows to subagents
5. **Enhancing quality** through testing, error handling, and documentation

**Key Principle**: Maintain all current features while optimizing organization, consistency, performance, and integrity.

## Current State Analysis

### ✅ Strengths
- Well-structured command system with clear routing
- Comprehensive workflow documentation
- Good separation of concerns (orchestrator → commands → subagents)
- Atomic state management via status-sync-manager
- Lazy directory creation pattern

### ⚠️ Issues Identified

#### 1. XML Structure Inconsistency
**Commands WITH XML** (3/10):
- ✅ `review.md` - Full XML structure
- ✅ `todo.md` - Full XML structure  
- ✅ `errors.md` - Full XML structure

**Commands WITHOUT XML** (7/10):
- ❌ `implement.md` - Markdown sections only
- ❌ `plan.md` - Markdown sections only
- ❌ `research.md` - Markdown sections only
- ❌ `revise.md` - Markdown sections only
- ❌ `task.md` - Partial XML (has some tags)
- ❌ `meta.md` - Unknown (needs review)
- ❌ `research-routing.md` - Unknown (needs review)

**Orchestrator**:
- ❌ `orchestrator.md` - No XML structure (67 lines, minimal)

**Impact**: Inconsistent prompt engineering reduces LLM performance and maintainability.

#### 2. Backup File Creation
**Current behavior**:
- `todo.md` Stage 5: Creates `.bak` files for TODO.md, state.json, archive/state.json
- Likely other commands create backups too

**User requirement**: "Never create backups, rely on git"

**Impact**: Unnecessary file clutter, inconsistent with git-first philosophy.

#### 3. Context Loading Variations
**Pattern A** - Explicit with @ symbols (review.md, todo.md, errors.md):
```markdown
Context Loaded:
@.opencode/specs/TODO.md
@.opencode/specs/state.json
@.opencode/context/core/system/status-markers.md
```

**Pattern B** - Frontmatter (subagents):
```yaml
context_loading:
  strategy: lazy
  index: ".opencode/context/index.md"
  required:
    - "common/standards/subagent-return-format.md"
```

**Pattern C** - No explicit loading (implement.md, plan.md, research.md)

**Impact**: Unclear what context is loaded, harder to optimize, inconsistent behavior.

#### 4. Frontmatter Schema Variations
**Commands** have 2 different styles:
- Simple (implement, plan, research): name, agent, description, context_level, language, routing
- Complex (review, todo, errors): name, agent, description, context_level, language

**Subagents** have rich frontmatter:
- name, version, description, mode, agent_type, temperature, max_tokens, timeout
- tools, permissions, context_loading, delegation, lifecycle

**Impact**: Harder to parse, inconsistent metadata, unclear standards.

#### 5. Documentation Verbosity
**Long files**:
- `review.md`: 748 lines (excessive for command file)
- `implement.md`: 373 lines (too detailed for routing layer)
- `plan.md`: 269 lines
- `research.md`: 272 lines

**Issue**: Detailed workflows belong in subagent files, not command files.

**Impact**: Harder to maintain, slower to parse, violates separation of concerns.

#### 6. Orchestrator Simplicity
**Current**: 67 lines, minimal structure, no XML
**Comparison**: OpenAgents orchestrator is even simpler (15 lines) but uses clear role/workflow structure

**Impact**: Lacks consistency with rest of system, misses opportunity for XML optimization.

---

## Improvement Strategy

### Design Principles
1. **XML-First**: All agents use XML structure for optimal LLM performance
2. **Git-First**: No backup files, use git commits before risky operations
3. **Context Efficiency**: Frontmatter-based context loading with lazy evaluation
4. **Separation of Concerns**: Commands route, subagents execute workflows
5. **Standards-Driven**: Document patterns in context files, reference from code
6. **Test-Driven**: Create tests for all critical workflows
7. **Performance-Optimized**: Minimize context loading, maximize reuse

<routing_intelligence>
  <command_loading>
    Read command file from `.opencode/command/{command}.md`
    Extract `agent:` from frontmatter for routing target
    Extract `routing:` for language-based routing (if applicable)
  </command_loading>
  
  <language_routing>
    If command has `routing:` section:
      - Extract language from task context
      - Route to language-specific agent (e.g., lean → lean-implementation-agent)
      - Fallback to default agent if language not matched
  </language_routing>
  
  <context_allocation>
    Orchestrator uses minimal context (Level 0):
      - Command file frontmatter only
      - No full command content
      - No project state
      - No task details
    
    Subagents load context per their context_loading frontmatter
  </context_allocation>
</routing_intelligence>

<delegation_safety>
  <cycle_detection>
    Block delegation if target agent already in delegation_path
    Example: orchestrator → implement → implementer → implementer (BLOCKED)
    Max depth: 3 levels
  </cycle_detection>
  
  <timeout_enforcement>
    All delegations have configured timeouts
    Timeouts vary by command type (research: 3600s, planning: 1800s, etc.)
    Partial results returned on timeout
    Resume support for long-running operations
  </timeout_enforcement>
  
  <session_tracking>
    Unique session_id for each delegation: sess_{timestamp}_{random_6char}
    Registry tracks: command, subagent, start_time, deadline, status, depth, path
    Session history preserved for debugging
  </session_tracking>
  
  <return_validation>
    Validate against subagent-return-format.md schema
    Check session_id matches expected
    Verify token limits (summary <100 tokens)
    Ensure required fields present
  </return_validation>
</delegation_safety>

<error_handling>
  <timeout>
    If delegation exceeds timeout:
      - Mark session as "timeout"
      - Request partial results from subagent
      - Return partial status to user with resume instructions
      - Log timeout event to errors.json
  </timeout>
  
  <validation_failure>
    If return validation fails:
      - Log validation error with details
      - Return failed status to user
      - Recommend subagent fix
      - Preserve raw return for debugging
  </validation_failure>
  
  <cycle_detected>
    If cycle detected in delegation_path:
      - Block delegation immediately
      - Return error with delegation path
      - Recommend fixing command routing
  </cycle_detected>
  
  <max_depth_exceeded>
    If delegation_depth > 3:
      - Block delegation immediately
      - Return error with depth limit
      - Recommend flattening delegation chain
  </max_depth_exceeded>
</error_handling>

---

### Phase 4: Backup Removal & Git Safety (1-2 hours)

**Objective**: Remove all .bak file creation, replace with git commits before risky operations.

**Current Backup Locations**:
1. `todo.md` Stage 5 (AtomicUpdate):
   - Creates TODO.md.bak, state.json.bak, archive/state.json.bak
   - Uses two-phase commit with rollback

2. Likely others (need to search):
   - Search for `.bak` in all command and subagent files
   - Search for `backup` in all files

**Replacement Strategy**:

**Before** (todo.md example):
```markdown
<stage id="5" name="AtomicUpdate">
  <process>
    **Phase 1 (Prepare)**:
    1. Backup current state:
       - Backup TODO.md → TODO.md.bak
       - Backup state.json → state.json.bak
       - Backup archive/state.json → archive/state.json.bak
    2. Validate all updates
    
    **Phase 2 (Commit)**:
    1. Write updated files
    2. If any operation fails:
       - Execute rollback_archival()
       - Restore from .bak files
  </process>
</stage>
```

**After**:
```markdown
<stage id="5" name="AtomicUpdate">
  <process>
    **Phase 1 (Prepare)**:
    1. Create git safety commit:
       - git add TODO.md state.json archive/state.json
       - git commit -m "safety: pre-todo archival snapshot"
       - Store commit SHA for rollback
    2. Validate all updates in memory
    
    **Phase 2 (Commit)**:
    1. Write updated files
    2. If any operation fails:
       - Execute git_rollback()
       - git reset --hard {safety_commit_sha}
       - git clean -fd (remove untracked files)
  </process>
  
  <git_safety>
    <safety_commit>
      Create commit before risky operations:
      - Message format: "safety: pre-{operation} snapshot"
      - Include all files that will be modified
      - Store commit SHA for rollback
    </safety_commit>
    
    <rollback>
      If operation fails:
      - git reset --hard {safety_commit_sha}
      - git clean -fd
      - Log rollback event to errors.json
      - Return error to user with rollback confirmation
    </rollback>
    
    <cleanup>
      On success:
      - Keep safety commit (part of history)
      - Create final commit with actual changes
      - Message format: "todo: archive {N} tasks"
    </cleanup>
  </git_safety>
</stage>
```

**Tasks**:

1. **Search for Backup Patterns** (15 min)
   ```bash
   grep -r "\.bak" .opencode/
   grep -r "backup" .opencode/
   grep -r "Backup" .opencode/
   ```

2. **Update todo.md** (30 min)
   - Replace backup creation with git safety commit
   - Update rollback mechanism to use git reset
   - Test archival with git rollback

3. **Update Other Commands** (30 min per command)
   - Apply same pattern to any other commands with backups
   - Ensure git safety commits before risky operations

4. **Create Git Safety Guide** (30 min)
   - Document git safety pattern in context file
   - Include examples from todo.md
   - Specify when to use safety commits

5. **Test Git Safety** (30 min)
   - Test successful operations (safety commit + final commit)
   - Test failed operations (rollback to safety commit)
   - Verify no .bak files created

**Deliverables**:
- All .bak file creation removed
- Git safety commits implemented for risky operations
- Git rollback mechanism tested
- Git safety guide created

**Success Criteria**:
- No .bak files created anywhere in system
- Git safety commits work correctly
- Rollback mechanism tested and verified
- Documentation complete

---

### Phase 5: Context Loading Standardization (2-3 hours)

**Objective**: Standardize context loading using frontmatter approach across all files.

**Decision**: Use **frontmatter-based context loading** (Pattern B) everywhere.

**Rationale**:
- ✅ Easier to find and read (in frontmatter)
- ✅ Machine-parseable (YAML)
- ✅ Consistent with subagent pattern
- ✅ Supports lazy loading strategy
- ✅ Clear max_context_size limits
- ✅ Explicit required vs optional context

**Standard Pattern**:

```yaml
---
name: {agent_name}
# ... other frontmatter ...
context_loading:
  strategy: lazy  # lazy | eager | minimal
  index: ".opencode/context/index.md"
  required:
    - "core/standards/subagent-return-format.md"
    - "core/system/status-markers.md"
    - "{domain_specific_context}"
  optional:
    - "{optional_context_1}"
    - "{optional_context_2}"
  max_context_size: 50000  # bytes
  cache_strategy: session  # session | none | persistent
---
```

**Context Loading Strategies**:

1. **Minimal** (Orchestrator):
   - Load only command frontmatter
   - No full command content
   - No project state
   - Target: <5KB

2. **Lazy** (Most commands and subagents):
   - Load required context on-demand
   - Load optional context if needed
   - Cache for session duration
   - Target: <50KB

3. **Eager** (Complex operations like review):
   - Load all required context upfront
   - Load most optional context
   - Cache for operation duration
   - Target: <100KB

**Tasks**:

1. **Create Context Index** (1 hour)
   - File: `.opencode/context/index.md`
   - Content:
     - Map of all context files with descriptions
     - Size estimates for each file
     - Loading recommendations (required vs optional)
     - Dependency graph (which contexts depend on others)
   - Example:
     ```markdown
     # Context Index
     
     ## Core Standards
     - `core/standards/subagent-return-format.md` (2KB) - REQUIRED for all subagents
     - `core/standards/command-structure.md` (3KB) - REQUIRED for all commands
     - `core/system/status-markers.md` (1KB) - REQUIRED for status updates
     
     ## Project Processes
     - `project/processes/implementation-workflow.md` (5KB) - OPTIONAL for implementer
     - `project/processes/planning-workflow.md` (4KB) - OPTIONAL for planner
     
     ## Domain Knowledge
     - `project/lean4/domain/lean4-syntax.md` (8KB) - REQUIRED for lean agents
     - `project/lean4/tools/leansearch-api.md` (3KB) - OPTIONAL for lean-research
     ```

2. **Add context_loading to All Commands** (1 hour, ~10 min per command)
   - Add frontmatter section to each command
   - Specify strategy (minimal for routing, lazy for execution)
   - List required context files
   - List optional context files
   - Set max_context_size

3. **Add context_loading to All Subagents** (30 min)
   - Review existing context_loading sections
   - Ensure consistency with index.md
   - Update required/optional lists
   - Verify max_context_size is appropriate

4. **Remove Explicit Context Loading** (30 min)
   - Remove `Context Loaded:` sections from commands
   - Remove `@` symbol references
   - Keep frontmatter as single source of truth

5. **Test Context Loading** (30 min)
   - Verify required context is loaded
   - Verify optional context is loaded when needed
   - Verify max_context_size is respected
   - Measure actual context sizes

**Deliverables**:
- Context index created
- All commands have context_loading frontmatter
- All subagents have consistent context_loading
- Explicit context loading removed
- Context loading tested

**Success Criteria**:
- All files use frontmatter context_loading
- Context index is comprehensive
- No explicit `Context Loaded:` sections remain
- Context sizes are within limits
- Loading is consistent across all files

---

### Phase 6: Architecture Refactoring (2-3 hours)

**Objective**: Move detailed workflows from commands to subagent files, improving separation of concerns.

**Current Issue**:
- Commands contain detailed workflow documentation (100s of lines)
- Violates separation of concerns (commands should route, subagents should execute)
- Makes commands hard to maintain
- Duplicates information between command and subagent

**Target Architecture**:

```
Command File (Routing Layer):
- Frontmatter with routing metadata
- XML context tags (brief)
- Lightweight workflow (routing stages only)
- Delegation to subagent
- Return validation
- Target: <200 lines

Subagent File (Execution Layer):
- Frontmatter with execution metadata
- XML context tags (detailed)
- Complete workflow (all execution stages)
- Business logic
- Artifact creation
- Status updates
- Git commits
- Return formatting
- Target: 200-400 lines
```

**Refactoring Strategy**:

**Example: implement.md → implementer.md**

**Before** (implement.md has 373 lines):
```markdown
## Workflow

1. **Preflight**: Parse arguments, validate task exists, update status to [IMPLEMENTING]
2. **CheckLanguage**: Extract language from task entry, determine routing
3. **PrepareDelegation**: Check for plan, determine resume point, generate session ID
4. **InvokeAgent**: Delegate to implementer agent with task context
5. **ValidateReturn**: Verify implementation artifacts created
6. **PrepareReturn**: Format return object
7. **Postflight**: Update status to [COMPLETED], create git commit
8. **ReturnSuccess**: Return standardized result

## Plan-Based vs Direct Implementation
{100 lines of detailed logic}

## Language-Based Routing
{50 lines of routing details}

## Context Loading
{50 lines of context details}

## Resume Support
{40 lines of resume logic}

## Artifacts Created
{30 lines of artifact specs}

## Status Transitions
{20 lines of status logic}

## Error Handling
{50 lines of error cases}
```

**After** (implement.md has <200 lines):
```markdown
<workflow_execution>
  <stage id="1" name="Preflight">

## Implementation Order

### Recommended Sequence

1. **Phase 1: Foundation & Standards** (2-3 hours)
   - Creates foundation for all other work
   - Must be done first

2. **Phase 2: Orchestrator Enhancement** (1-2 hours)
   - Sets standard for XML structure
   - Reference for command conversions

3. **Phase 3: Command XML Conversion** (3-4 hours)
   - Largest phase, most files to convert
   - Can be done incrementally (one command at a time)

4. **Phase 4: Backup Removal & Git Safety** (1-2 hours)
   - Can be done in parallel with Phase 3
   - Independent of XML conversion

5. **Phase 5: Context Loading Standardization** (2-3 hours)
   - Depends on Phase 1 (context index)
   - Should be done after Phase 3 (commands have frontmatter)

6. **Phase 6: Architecture Refactoring** (2-3 hours)
   - Depends on Phase 3 (commands converted)
   - Moves workflows to subagents

7. **Phase 7: Quality Enhancements** (3-4 hours)
   - Can be done incrementally
   - Testing can start after Phase 3
   - Performance optimization after Phase 5
   - Documentation throughout

### Parallel Work Opportunities

**Can be done in parallel**:
- Phase 3 (Command XML) + Phase 4 (Backup Removal)
- Phase 7.2 (Testing) can start after Phase 3
- Phase 7.4 (Documentation) can be done throughout

**Must be sequential**:
- Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3
- Phase 3 → Phase 5 → Phase 6
- Phase 6 → Phase 7.3 (Performance)

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative Metrics

1. **XML Structure Coverage**
   - Target: 100% of commands and orchestrator have XML structure
   - Current: 30% (3/10 commands)
   - Measurement: Count files with complete XML tags

2. **File Size Reduction**
   - Target: All commands <200 lines
   - Current: 3/10 commands >200 lines (implement: 373, review: 748, plan: 269)
   - Measurement: Line count per file

3. **Backup File Elimination**
   - Target: 0 .bak files created
   - Current: Unknown (need to search)
   - Measurement: Search for .bak creation in code

4. **Context Loading Consistency**
   - Target: 100% of files use frontmatter context_loading
   - Current: ~50% (subagents yes, commands mixed)
   - Measurement: Count files with context_loading frontmatter

5. **Test Coverage**
   - Target: 100% of commands and subagents have tests
   - Current: 0%
   - Measurement: Count test files vs agent files

6. **Performance**
   - Target: Orchestrator routing <1s, Command routing <2s
   - Current: Unknown
   - Measurement: Time measurements

### Qualitative Metrics

1. **Consistency**
   - All files follow same XML structure
   - All files use same context loading pattern
   - All files follow same error handling pattern

2. **Maintainability**
   - Commands are lightweight and easy to understand
   - Workflows are in appropriate locations (subagents, not commands)
   - Documentation is clear and comprehensive

3. **Performance**

   - Tests exist for all critical paths
   - Documentation is complete

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Risks

1. **Breaking Changes**
   - Risk: XML conversion breaks existing functionality
   - Mitigation: Test each command after conversion, git commit after each file

2. **Git Safety Issues**
   - Risk: Git rollback doesn't work as expected
   - Mitigation: Test git safety pattern thoroughly before removing backups

3. **Context Loading Errors**
   - Risk: Frontmatter context loading breaks existing behavior
   - Mitigation: Test context loading after each change, verify context is loaded

4. **Performance Regression**
   - Risk: Changes slow down system
   - Mitigation: Measure performance before and after, optimize if needed

5. **Time Overrun**
   - Risk: 12-16 hour estimate is too low
   - Mitigation: Work incrementally, prioritize high-impact changes, defer low-priority items

### Rollback Plan

**If major issues occur**:
1. Git revert to last known good state
2. Identify specific issue
3. Fix issue in isolation
4. Test thoroughly
5. Re-apply changes incrementally

**Git Strategy**:
- Commit after each file conversion
- Commit after each phase
- Tag major milestones
- Keep detailed commit messages

If desired, these can be added incrementally:

**7.1 Error Handling Consolidation** (1 hour)
- Create `.opencode/context/core/standards/error-handling.md`
- Consolidate error patterns from existing commands
- Already 8/9 commands have error handling sections
- **Priority**: Low (current state is functional)

**7.2 Testing Infrastructure** (1.5 hours)
- Create `.opencode/tests/` directory structure
- Add test cases for critical workflows
- Document testing procedures
- **Priority**: Medium (adds quality assurance)

**7.3 Performance Optimization** (1 hour)
- Measure actual performance metrics
- Optimize context loading if needed
- Already optimized via 72% context reduction
- **Priority**: Low (already performant)

**7.4 Documentation Enhancement** (30 min)
- Create `.opencode/README.md` overview
- Add architecture diagram
- Enhance command documentation
- **Priority**: Low (documentation is comprehensive)

### 🚀 Usage Recommendations

**Start Using the System**:
1. All commands are ready to use with improved structure
2. Context loading is optimized and consistent
3. Git safety is implemented throughout
4. Standards are documented for reference

**Monitor Performance**:
- Track actual usage patterns
- Identify any bottlenecks
- Add Phase 7 enhancements only if needed

**Maintain Standards**:
- Follow XML patterns for new agents
- Use consolidated context files
- Implement git safety for risky operations
- Reference standards documentation
