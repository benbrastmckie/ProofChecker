**Completed**: 2026-01-13
**Duration**: ~45 minutes (faster than estimated 3.5 hours)

## Changes Made

Created a 1,321-word public-facing essay titled "Teaching Machines to Prove They're Right" for the Cosmos Institute Substack. The essay synthesizes the three main grant contributions into an accessible narrative following the philosopher-builder theme.

## Files Created

- `docs/essays/cosmos-institute-essay.md` - The essay (1,321 words)

## Essay Structure

| Section | Words (approx) | Purpose |
|---------|----------------|---------|
| Title + Hook | 60 | Provocative opening question about AI verification |
| The Problem | 200 | AI reasoning without guarantees; imitation vs understanding |
| Philosophy as Engineering | 250 | Conceptual engineering thesis; materials science metaphor |
| The Innovation | 400 | Three contributions: proofs, language, training data |
| Why It Matters | 250 | Scalable oversight; proof receipts; applications |
| The Invitation | 200 | Philosopher-builder connection; infrastructure for trust |
| Conclusion | 110 | Forward-looking; path from pattern matching |

## Style Alignment

The essay follows Cosmos Institute Substack style:
- Provocative thesis opening ("Can it prove its reasoning is correct?")
- Philosophical-technical blend throughout
- Materials science metaphor for conceptual engineering
- Concrete applications (medical, legal, multi-agent)
- Invitation to engagement closing
- Paragraph variation for rhythmic pacing

## Key Messages

1. **The Problem**: Current AI imitates reasoning; cannot verify correctness
2. **The Solution**: Conceptual engineering - building precise logical operators
3. **The Contributions**:
   - Machine-verified proofs in Lean 4
   - A language for planning under uncertainty
   - Unlimited verified training data via dual verification
4. **The Stakes**: Scalable oversight through proof receipts and explicit semantics
5. **The Invitation**: Infrastructure for trustworthy AI; open for collaboration

## Verification

- Word count: 1,321 (within 1000-2000 target)
- All three contributions clearly presented
- Cosmos Institute style characteristics present
- Opening is engaging and provocative
- Conclusion invites engagement
- Technical content accessible without jargon

## Notes

- Essay includes closing attribution to Cosmos Institute grant
- Ready for author review and potential submission
- May benefit from author personal anecdotes if desired (following CI style)
