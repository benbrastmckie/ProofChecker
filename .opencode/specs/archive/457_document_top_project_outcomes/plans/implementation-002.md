# Implementation Plan: Task #457

**Task**: Document top 2-3 project outcomes for grant reporting
**Version**: 002
**Created**: 2026-01-13
**Revised From**: 001
**Language**: general

## Revision Notes

Refocused outcomes per user direction:
1. **Proofs established**: soundness, deduction theorem, decidability
2. **Methodology**: axiomatic proof system + recursive semantics + metalogic for Logos (unified formal language for multi-agent planning under uncertainty)
3. **Foundation for AI training**: clean, unbounded positive RL signal for verified reasoning in an interpreted language of thought

## Phases

### Phase 1: Prepare Grant Report Text

**Estimated effort**: 30 minutes
**Status**: [NOT STARTED]

**Deliverable**: Grant report text with 3 outcome bullet points

---

## Recommended Output (Revised)

**Grant Report - Top 3 Outcomes:**

1) Established the first Lean 4 formalization of a bimodal logic for reasoning about future contingency, including machine-verified proofs of core metalogical properties including soundness, the deduction theorem, and decidability.
2) Developed a formal methodology combining an axiomatic proof system, recursive semantics, and metalogic for the Logos, a unified formal language for planning and evaluating complex actions in multi-agent systems under conditions of uncertainty.
3) Provided a foundation for generating clean, unbounded positive reinforcement learning signals for training AI systems in verified reasoning in an interpreted formal language of thought.
