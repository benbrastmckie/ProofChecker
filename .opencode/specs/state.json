  "description": "Refactor the /task command to directly create task entries in TODO.md and state.json without delegating to description-clarifier and task-creator subagents. The command should reformulate the user's rough description into a clear 2-3 sentence description inline, look up next_project_number from state.json, create the task entry in both files atomically, and increment next_project_number. This simplifies the architecture by removing unnecessary delegation layers while maintaining the same functionality. The command should support the optional flag --divide which creates divides the task into an appropriate number of tasks (between 1-5 tasks). No other flags are needed.",

  "research_summary": "Main branch /task command (380 lines, 5 stages, NO delegation, <5s) is exactly what we want. Current branch overcomplicated it with description-clarifier + task-creator (454 lines, 420s timeout). Recommendation: Revert to main branch approach with ONE improvement - atomic updates via status-sync-manager. Remove unnecessary subagents. Preserve simplicity: 'Direct file operations only. No subagent delegation.'",
