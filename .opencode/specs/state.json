  "description": "Refactor the /task command to directly create task entries in TODO.md and state.json without delegating to description-clarifier and task-creator subagents. The command should reformulate the user's rough description into a clear 2-3 sentence description inline, look up next_project_number from state.json, create the task entry in both files atomically, and increment next_project_number. This simplifies the architecture by removing unnecessary delegation layers while maintaining the same functionality. The command should still support optional flags (--priority, --effort, --language) and perform basic language detection from keywords in the description.",
