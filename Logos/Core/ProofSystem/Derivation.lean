# Derivation - Proof System for TM Logic

This module defines derivation trees for bimodal logic TM,
representing syntactic provability from a context of assumptions.

## Main Definitions

- `DerivationTree`: Inductive type `Γ ⊢ φ` representing a derivation tree for φ from context Γ
- `DerivationTree.height`: Computable height function for derivation trees
- Notation `⊢ φ` for derivability from empty context (theorem)
- Notation `Γ ⊢ φ` for derivability from context Γ

## Inference Rules

The derivation tree includes 7 inference rules:

1. **axiom**: Any axiom schema instance is derivable
2. **assumption**: Formulas in context are derivable
3. **modus_ponens**: If `Γ ⊢ φ → ψ` and `Γ ⊢ φ` then `Γ ⊢ ψ`
4. **necessitation**: If `⊢ φ` then `⊢ □φ` (standard modal necessitation)
5. **temporal_necessitation**: If `⊢ φ` then `⊢ Fφ` (standard temporal necessitation)
6. **temporal_duality**: If `⊢ φ` then `⊢ swap_past_future φ`
7. **weakening**: If `Γ ⊢ φ` and `Γ ⊆ Δ` then `Δ ⊢ φ`

## Implementation Notes

- `DerivationTree` is a `Type` (not a `Prop`), enabling pattern matching and computable functions
- Height function is computable via pattern matching (not axiomatized)
- Height properties are proven as theorems (not axioms)
- Necessitation rules only apply to theorems (empty context)
- Temporal duality only applies to theorems (empty context)
- Weakening allows adding unused assumptions
- K distribution is handled by axioms (`modal_k_dist`, `temp_k_dist`)

Derivation tree for bimodal logic TM.

`DerivationTree Γ φ` (written `Γ ⊢ φ`) represents a derivation tree showing
that formula `φ` is derivable from the context of assumptions `Γ` using the TM proof system.

The derivation tree is defined inductively with 7 inference rules covering:
- Axiom usage and assumptions
- Modus ponens (implication elimination)
- Modal and temporal necessitation (from theorems to necessary theorems)
- Temporal duality (swapping past/future)
- Weakening (adding unused assumptions)

## Implementation Notes

Since `DerivationTree` is a `Type` (not a `Prop`), we can pattern match on it
to produce data. This enables computable functions like `height` and supports
well-founded recursion in metalogical proofs.

  Necessitation rule: From theorems, derive necessary theorems.

  If `⊢ φ` (derivable from empty context), then `⊢ □φ`.

  This is the standard necessitation rule of modal logic. It only applies
  to theorems (proofs from no assumptions), not to derivations from contexts.

  This rule expresses: if φ is a theorem (provable without assumptions),
  then it is necessarily true (□φ is also a theorem).

  **Note**: The generalized rule `Γ ⊢ φ` ⟹ `□Γ ⊢ □φ` is derivable from
  this rule plus K distribution (`modal_k_dist`) and the deduction theorem.
  See `Logos.Core.Theorems.GeneralizedNecessitation` for the derivation.

  Temporal necessitation rule: From theorems, derive future-necessary theorems.

  If `⊢ φ` (derivable from empty context), then `⊢ Fφ`.

  This is the temporal analog of modal necessitation. It only applies
  to theorems (proofs from no assumptions), not to derivations from contexts.

  This rule expresses: if φ is a theorem (provable without assumptions),
  then it will always be true (Fφ is also a theorem).

  **Note**: The generalized rule `Γ ⊢ φ` ⟹ `FΓ ⊢ Fφ` is derivable from
  this rule plus temporal K distribution (`temp_k_dist`) and the deduction theorem.

  This rule only applies to theorems (proofs from no assumptions).

  This allows adding extra assumptions that don't affect the derivation.

/-! ## Derivation Height Measure -/

/--
Computable height function via pattern matching.

The height is defined as the maximum depth of the derivation tree:
- Base cases (axiom, assumption): height 0
- Unary rules (necessitation, temporal_necessitation, temporal_duality, weakening):
  height of subderivation + 1
- Binary rules (modus_ponens): max of both subderivations + 1

This measure is used for well-founded recursion in the deduction theorem proof.

## Implementation Notes

Since `DerivationTree` is a `Type` (not a `Prop`), we can pattern match on it
to produce data. The height function is computable and can be evaluated.

## Usage

The height measure is primarily used in `Logos.Core.Metalogic.DeductionTheorem`
for proving termination of the deduction theorem via well-founded recursion.
