# Logos.Explanatory - Layer 1 (Future Extension)

**Status**: Planned for future development

## Overview

The Explanatory layer extends Core TM logic with operators for causal, counterfactual, and constitutive reasoning.

## Planned Operators

- **Counterfactual**: `□→` (would), `◇→` (might)
- **Constitutive**: `≤` (grounds), `⊑` (essence), `≡` (identity), `≼` (priority)
- **Causal**: `○→` (causes)

## Semantic Extension

- **MaximalState**: Replaces point-based WorldState with structured states containing:
  - Ground facts (ontological base layer)
  - Derived facts (grounded in base layer)
  - Constitutive relations between facts

## Timeline

Estimated 3-6 months post Core MVP completion.

## Documentation

See [LAYER_EXTENSIONS.md](../../Documentation/Research/LAYER_EXTENSIONS.md) Section 1 for complete specification.
