# Research Summary: Task 523 Bimodal Cleanup

## Key Findings
Task 523 is premature because task 505 (bimodal restructuring) was only researched, not implemented. Current Bimodal directory contains 63 Lean files with architectural issues still present.

## Research Results
- **Files analyzed**: 63 Lean files in Theories/Bimodal/
- **Critical discovery**: No restructuring has occurred yet
- **Current state**: Pre-restructuring with scattered architecture
- **Documentation mismatch**: README describes ideal state, not actual state
- **Boneyard**: Contains 2 deprecated files

## Recommendations
**DEFER task 523 until task 505 is implemented**. Post-restructuring cleanup will require:
- File restructuring (2-3 hours)
- Code consolidation (4-6 hours) 
- Documentation updates (2-3 hours)
- Boneyard management (1-2 hours)
- Validation (1-2 hours)

**Total estimated effort**: 10-16 hours across 5 phases
