      "description": "Clean up Lean source code documentation in Bimodal/ theory to present only the current state with no historical mentions. **Scope change**: Remove ALL historical artifacts including: (1) provenance comments ('-- Origin: Boneyard/...') from Core/*.lean files, (2) SUPERSEDED/DEPRECATED docblocks and markers, (3) narrative history explaining past approaches or 'why we did X instead of Y', (4) references to Boneyard in active code comments. Goal is clean, present-tense documentation describing what the code IS, not where it came from or what it replaced. Also: (a) update remaining Boneyard imports in GeneralizedNecessitation.lean and Propositional.lean to use Core, (b) move compatibility shims Metalogic.lean and Metalogic_v2.lean to Boneyard/Compat/, (c) verify complete Boneyard isolation.",
