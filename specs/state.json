      "description": "Fix agent system interruption failures where MCP tool calls return AbortError (-32001) and agents get stuck at Interrupted prompt. Root cause analysis from /research 657 and /implement 630 failures shows: (1) lean-research-agent interrupted during lean_local_search calls, (2) lean-implementation-agent interrupted during lean_diagnostic_messages call. Both agents failed to write return metadata files, leaving tasks stuck in researching/implementing status. System improvements needed: error recovery for MCP tool failures, graceful interruption handling, partial progress preservation, and metadata file writing on timeout/abort."
