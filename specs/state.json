Articulate theorem in Lean source with proof strategy in comments; (2) line 288: Derive Barcan formulas and prove their validity for the unrestricted quantifier and 'all possibly actual' quantifier. Similarly, show that the 'all sometimes actual' quantifier validates temporal analogs of Barcan formulas."
