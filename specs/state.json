Replace 'Acceptable for Development' category with 'Tolerated During Development (Technical Debt)'. Add explicit section on how to characterize sorries in reports/plans emphasizing that: (1) ALL sorries are mathematical debt, (2) sorries propagate transitively through imports, (3) publication requires zero inherited sorries. Add framing: 'Document what exists, explain WHY it exists, specify the remediation path - never call a sorry acceptable.'",
