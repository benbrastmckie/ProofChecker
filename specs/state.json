The current implementation (lines 67-91) creates only one history, which trivializes modal operators.

Articulate theorem in Lean source with proof strategy in comments; (2) line 288: Derive Barcan formulas and prove their validity for the unrestricted quantifier and 'all possibly actual' quantifier.
