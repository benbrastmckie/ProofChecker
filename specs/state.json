      "description": "Derive and prove 2 theorem groups in Logos Dynamics system based on TODO items: (1) line 200: Derive as theorem that every time in a world-history gets mapped to a world-state, then include remark discussing which constraints (from Containment subsection of counterfactual_worlds.tex line 1822) play a role in proving this theorem without assuming discreteness. Articulate theorem in Lean source with proof strategy in comments; (2) line 288: Derive Barcan formulas and prove their validity for the unrestricted quantifier and 'all possibly actual' quantifier. Similarly, show that the 'all sometimes actual' quantifier validates temporal analogs of Barcan formulas.",
