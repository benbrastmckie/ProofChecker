      "description": "Design and implement witness extraction architecture to enable backward Truth Lemma proofs. The backward temporal cases (lines 423, 441 in TruthLemma.lean) require proving: Hψ ∉ mcs(t) → ∃ s < t. ψ ∉ mcs(s) (and symmetric for G). Task 659 Phase 2 assessment showed that forward_H coherence does NOT provide this—the contrapositive gives universal (∀) statements, not existential (∃) witnesses. This task explores architectural approaches: (1) direct witness construction via MCS chain properties, (2) semantic completeness argument (if ψ ∈ mcs(s) for all s < t, then Hψ ∈ mcs(t)), or (3) alternative proof strategies that bypass witness extraction.
