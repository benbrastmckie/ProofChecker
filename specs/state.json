      "description": "Ensure all command workflows enforce the skill-based checkpoint pattern (GATE IN → DELEGATE → GATE OUT → COMMIT) by preventing direct agent invocation and guaranteeing postflight operations execute. Current issue: Commands can bypass skills and call agents directly via Task tool, causing missing status updates, artifact linking, and git commits. Solution: Add validation layer that enforces skill delegation, implement postflight verification, and document the checkpoint contract.",
