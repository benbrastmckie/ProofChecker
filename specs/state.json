Standard witness families are CONSTANT (same MCS at every time) - needs systematic fix to admit families with different MCSs at different times\n2. Truth lemma assumed only needed for eval family - hits dead end for complex formulas\n3. Taking all MCSs to form a single canonical family does not work\n\nThe correct path:\n1. Define MCSs as world states\n2. Define four-constraint accessibility relation: one MCS related to another iff whenever Box G phi is in the left MCS, then phi is in the right MCS\n3. Define families as functions Int -> MCS where each MCS sees the next MCS or is seen by the previous MCS (using the accessibility relation)\n4. This constructs a bundle of families resembling world histories\n5. Prove every consistent sentence belongs to an MCS at time 0 in some family\n6. Establish TruthLemma: sentence belongs to MCS in family iff sentence is true when evaluated at that family at the corresponding integer\n\nThis construction is the core of the representation theorem. It may be hard to find but once found will be obviously correct and relatively easy to verify.",

CONSTRAINT: Sorry debt is NEVER acceptable — the study must find a path to zero sorries, not evaluate sorry acceptance as an option.\n\nThe study should focus on LEARNING FROM FAILURES to inspire creative solutions:\n\n**Pattern Analysis of Failed Approaches:**\n- What common assumptions did linear chains, enriched chains, omega-squared chains, witness-graph-guided approaches, and FPreservingSeed all share that led to failure?\n- Is the \"Lindenbaum opacity\" a fundamental barrier, or does it reveal a hidden assumption we can drop?\n- Why did 12 successive plan revisions each believe their approach would work when all hit the same wall? What cognitive trap is at play?\n\n**Creative Reframing Questions:**\n- What if the problem is not \"prove forward_F for a chain\" but \"find a structure that makes forward_F trivially true\"?\n- Are there proof techniques from other domains (set theory, category theory, type theory) that handle similar \"witness existence under opacity\" problems?\n- Can we work backward from the goal state (a BFMCS Int with forward_F) to discover what properties the construction MUST have, rather than forward from chain construction?\n- What if we abandon BFMCS Int entirely and prove completeness through a different semantic structure?\n\n**Mandatory Outputs:**\n1. A \"lessons learned\" document identifying the precise mathematical property that all failed approaches lacked\n2. At least 3 genuinely novel approach ideas that do NOT fit the \"bottom-up chain construction\" pattern\n3. For each novel approach: a preliminary feasibility assessment with confidence level\n4. A ranked recommendation with clear decision criteria\n\nKey artifacts to study: `specs/916_implement_fp_witness_obligation_tracking/` (all reports, plans, handoffs), particularly the Phase 3 blocker analysis (`handoffs/phase-3-blocker-analysis-20260224.md`) which crystallizes the obstruction.",

The current sorry in TemporalCoherentConstruction.lean (fully_saturated_bmcs_exists_int) requires:\n1. Modal saturation: every consistent formula set can be extended to a fully saturated MCS (Lindenbaum via modal witnesses)\n2. Temporal coherence: the resulting family satisfies forward_G and backward_H\n3. Both simultaneously: modal saturation adds constant witness families, which must themselves be temporally coherent\n\nThe tension: modal saturation uses Lindenbaum extension which does NOT preserve temporal saturation (where F(psi) -> psi). The current approach proves temporal coherence and modal saturation separately but cannot combine them.\n\nContext: Task 922 proved forward_F and backward_P sorry-free using the Preorder/all-MCS approach. This task addresses the remaining sorry: constructing a fully saturated BMCS that satisfies ALL four conditions simultaneously (forward_G, backward_H, forward_F, backward_P) with a root MCS witnessing a given consistent formula.\n\nKey files:\n- Theories/Bimodal/Metalogic/Bundle/TemporalCoherentConstruction.lean - contains fully_saturated_bmcs_exists_int sorry\n- Theories/Bimodal/Metalogic/Bundle/ModalSaturation.lean - modal saturation tools\n- Theories/Bimodal/Metalogic/Bundle/CanonicalBFMCS.lean - new all-MCS BFMCS construction from task 922\n\nDependency: Requires task 922 to be complete (Preorder generalization providing sorry-free forward_F/backward_P).",
