      "description": "The three team skills (skill-team-research, skill-team-plan, skill-team-implement) currently set default_model correctly based on task language (opus for lean, sonnet for all others) but only pass it as advisory text in teammate prompts via model_preference_line. TeammateTool supports an explicit model parameter. The fix is to add model: $default_model when spawning teammates in each skill, ensuring Opus 4.6 is always used for Lean tasks and Sonnet 4.6 for all others. Files to change: .claude/skills/skill-team-research/SKILL.md, .claude/skills/skill-team-plan/SKILL.md, .claude/skills/skill-team-implement/SKILL.md, .claude/utils/team-wave-helpers.md, .claude/context/core/patterns/team-orchestration.md. Also remove or update the now-redundant model_preference_line advisory text and the model_preference_line variable since the model is enforced via the parameter.",
