Root cause: Claude Code bugs (#15945, #13254, #4580) cause MCP tools to hang indefinitely in subagents with no timeout mechanism. Solution: Execute Lean MCP operations directly in skills rather than delegating to lean-research-agent and lean-implementation-agent subagents, eliminating the problematic delegation layer while preserving all functionality.",
