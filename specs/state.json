Task 659 Phase 2 assessment showed that forward_H coherence does NOT provide this—the contrapositive gives universal (∀) statements, not existential (∃) witnesses. This task explores architectural approaches: (1) direct witness construction via MCS chain properties, (2) semantic completeness argument (if ψ ∈ mcs(s) for all s < t, then Hψ ∈ mcs(t)), or (3) alternative proof strategies that bypass witness extraction.

Articulate theorem in Lean source with proof strategy in comments; (2) line 288: Derive Barcan formulas and prove their validity for the unrestricted quantifier and 'all possibly actual' quantifier. Similarly, show that the 'all sometimes actual' quantifier validates temporal analogs of Barcan formulas.",
