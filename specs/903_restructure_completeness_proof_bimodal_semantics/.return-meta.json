  "summary": "The current completeness proof uses BMCS-internal semantics (bmcs_truth_at, bmcs_valid) rather than the standard definitions (truth_at, valid, TaskFrame, TaskModel, WorldHistory). Seven structural divergences identified. The recommended approach is to build a new StandardCompleteness.lean bridge module that constructs a canonical TaskFrame (WorldState=CanonicalWorldState, trivial task_rel), canonical TaskModel (valuation from MCS membership), and canonical WorldHistories (from IndexedMCSFamily, universal domain) and proves a canonical truth lemma against the standard truth_at. The box case resolves via the CanonicalWorldState insight: since every WorldHistory assigns MCS values to times, phi-in-all-MCS implies phi-true-at-all-WorldHistories. Seven orphan files (~6,191 lines) are Tier-1 Boneyard candidates; one FALSE axiom must be removed.",
