Added comprehensive documentation of three skill architecture patterns (A: delegating with internal postflight, B: direct execution, C: orchestrator). Converted all diagrams to Unicode box-drawing characters. Added command-skill-agent mapping matrix covering all 11 commands. Reconciled agent and user documentation with Last Verified dates and cross-references.",
