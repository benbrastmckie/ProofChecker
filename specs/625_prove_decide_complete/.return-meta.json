The main challenge is that buildTableau returning allClosed does not directly produce a DerivationTree proof term - the decide function may still return timeout if proof extraction fails. Three approaches identified: (1) bridge with sorry placeholder, (2) strengthen proof extraction to reconstruct proofs from closure reasons, (3) weaken statement to avoid explicit proof term.",
