    "key_findings": [
      "Current gap: ClosedBranch provides semantic closure evidence, but DerivationTree needs syntactic proof terms",
      "Current extraction only works for direct axiom matches; contradiction/botPos closures produce no proof",
      "Full reconstruction requires: enhanced closure tracking (history), rule correspondence proofs (14 rules), reconstruction algorithm, propositional infrastructure",
      "Estimated effort: 150-280 hours (4-8 weeks focused work)",
      "Alternative approaches available: selective reconstruction (~60-80 hours), axiom-based trust, external checker"

    "recommendation": "Proceed with Task 625 using existing infrastructure; document gaps; consider weaker theorem statement if needed; create separate task for full reconstruction when ready"
