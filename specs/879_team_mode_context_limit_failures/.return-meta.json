  "summary": "Identified root cause of teammate context limit failures: Lean implementation work consumes context rapidly through repeated lean_goal calls, file reads, and verbose proof state outputs. Recommended mitigations include phase chunking (split multi-hour phases into 30-60 min sub-phases), context-aware agent prompts, and accepting partial progress as normal recovery pattern.",
