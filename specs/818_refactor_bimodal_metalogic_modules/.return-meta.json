Found: (1) Original Truth Lemma backwards direction for box was architecturally unprovable due to quantification over all histories vs. only canonical histories. (2) Current system has two complementary completeness results (BMCS and FMP-internal) that together with standard soundness form a complete metalogic. Both are 'right' completeness in the Henkin sense.",
