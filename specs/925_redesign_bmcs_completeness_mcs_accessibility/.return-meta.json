Proved BoxGContent/BoxHContent hierarchy, chain temporal coherence (forward_G, backward_H), pairwise comparability, Zorn existence, forward_F/backward_P witnesses, Diamond persistence, and BoxContent propagation. All proofs sorry-free with zero new axioms. Fixed diamond_persistent_backward using box_to_past derivation. Remaining: Phase 2 (Boneyard cleanup), Phase 7 (chain-bundle BMCS with modal saturation - key sorry elimination target), Phases 8-10."
