  "summary": "Investigated alternative construction approaches for multi-family saturated BMCS. Found that enumeration-based construction is viable using the proven CoherentWitness infrastructure. The key insight is that Lindenbaum extension cannot be controlled, so coherence must be built into the witness seed. Recommended completing CoherentConstruction.lean via enumeration with strengthened box-equivalence coherence (30-48 hours estimated).",
