  "summary": "The representation_theorem call at line 248 is confirmed dead code. It can be safely removed along with the h_neg_cons helper (lines 239-244) and associated comments (lines 233-261). The proof initially tried using representation_theorem on {phi.neg} alone, but this was abandoned because it doesn't guarantee Gamma is satisfied. The actual proof uses set_lindenbaum on Gamma ∪ {phi.neg} instead.",
