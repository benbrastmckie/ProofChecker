Defined UnionBoxContent, MutuallyCoherent predicate, CoherentBundle structure, basic properties, and toBMCS conversion. All proofs complete (no sorries). The toBMCS conversion proves modal_forward via mutual coherence and modal_backward via contraposition with saturation. This provides complete infrastructure for axiom-free BMCS construction.",
