Key insight: restrict to constant families (all witnesses are constant) to avoid time-mismatch issues. The completed diamond_boxcontent_consistent_constant theorem provides the foundation. Proposed structure includes all_constant constraint, MutuallyCoherent predicate, and saturation via Zorn's lemma.",
