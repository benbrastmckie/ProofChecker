  "summary": "Phase 1 partial: Implemented seedToConstantMCS bridge (constant MCS from seed via Lindenbaum). Architecture analysis revealed plan v5 assumption about non-constant families was incorrect. Revised to use constant family approach via existing constantIndexedMCSFamily infrastructure.",
  "artifacts": [],
  "partial_progress": {
    "stage": "phase_1_partial",
    "details": "Added seedFormulasAtZero, buildSeed_seedFormulasAtZero_consistent, seedToConstantMCS, seedToConstantMCS_is_mcs, seedToConstantMCS_contains_phi. buildSeed_hasPosition_zero has 1 auxiliary sorry. Phase 1 scope partially achieved - constant MCS construction works but temporal coherence for non-constant families was found to be architecturally complex.",
    "resume_point": "Wire seedToConstantMCS to constantIndexedMCSFamily in Construction.lean to complete Phase 1"
