Main construction requires: (1) initial CoherentBundle from Lindenbaum-extended base family, (2) generalization of diamond_boxcontent_consistent_constant to UnionBoxContent, (3) iterative or Zorn-based saturation adding coherent witnesses. The constant-family approach avoids Lindenbaum control problems that block the SaturatedConstruction.lean path.",
