  "summary": "Analyzed shift-closed canonical Omega approach. Key finding: shift-closed Omega alone does NOT eliminate sorries because Set.univ mismatch persists. The viable path is Option B: add ShiftClosed Omega to valid/semantic_consequence definitions. The critical new insight is box_persistent (Box phi propagates across ALL times via TF axiom and its temporal dual), which enables a shifted truth lemma for the enlarged Omega. Estimated 18-27 hours for full implementation.",
