Identified 7 code changes needed: remove constant-family infrastructure (38 lines, 1 sorry eliminated), generalize CanonicalWorldState to allow any SetMaximalConsistent set, update mkCanonicalWorldState/canonicalHistory for time-varying states, define canonicalOmega as set of canonical histories, rewrite truth lemma with fam.mcs t anchor (eliminates Box forward sorry), update completeness theorems with new satisfiable witnesses. Discovered critical Omega-mismatch issue: valid uses Set.univ but satisfiable/representation use canonicalOmega, making weak/strong completeness proofs require reconciliation (either change valid definition or accept temporary sorry). Net sorry reduction: -1 to -2 depending on resolution approach.",
