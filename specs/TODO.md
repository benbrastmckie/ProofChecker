# TODO

## Tasks
### 995. FMCS domain transfer lemma
- **Effort**: TBD (estimated 8-12 hours)
- **Status**: [NOT STARTED]
- **Language**: lean
- **Priority**: high

**Description**: Build a general FMCS transfer lemma: given an order-embedding `e : CanonicalMCS → D` (where D has `AddCommGroup + LinearOrder + IsOrderedAddMonoid`), transfer temporal coherence (forward_F, backward_P) from the sorry-free `CanonicalMCS`-based BFMCS to a `BFMCS D`. This is the single highest-leverage piece of work in the codebase. The CanonicalMCS construction (in `CanonicalFMCS.lean`) is fully proven with zero sorries for forward_F, backward_P, and modal saturation. The only remaining gap is that `CanonicalMCS` lacks `AddCommGroup`, so it cannot serve as D in `TaskFrame`. This transfer lemma bridges that gap and simultaneously unblocks: (1) base completeness (embed into ℤ), (2) dense completeness (embed into ℚ via Cantor), (3) discrete completeness (embed into ℤ with SuccOrder).

---

### 994. Wire soundness theorem assembly
- **Effort**: TBD (estimated 4-6 hours)
- **Status**: [NOT STARTED]
- **Language**: lean

**Description**: Wire the 6 remaining sorries in `Soundness.lean` (lines 565, 569, 572, 575, 595, 598) using the already-proven component theorems. The sorries cover: (1) density axiom validity — proven in `DenseSoundness.axiom_dense_valid`, (2) discreteness_forward validity — proven in `DiscreteSoundness.axiom_discrete_valid`, (3) seriality_future/past validity — proven in `DiscreteSoundness`, (4) temporal_duality rule — component proof in `SoundnessLemmas.axiom_swap_valid`, (5) IRR rule — needs product frame construction. The main challenge is that the soundness theorem quantifies over ALL D, but the extension axioms are only valid on frames with specific properties (DenselyOrdered, SuccOrder, etc.). Resolution: either restrict the soundness statement to appropriate frame classes, or use the `Axiom.frameClass` classification already defined in `Axioms.lean` (lines 477-497) to dispatch each axiom to its correct frame class.

---

### 993. Add stability operator to bimodal formula language
- **Effort**: TBD
- **Status**: [NOT STARTED]
- **Language**: lean

**Description**: Add the stability operator (box-dot) to the bimodal formula language. The stability operator quantifies over histories passing through the same world state at a given time: (box-dot)phi at (alpha, t) holds iff phi holds at (beta, t) for all beta in Omega with beta(t) = alpha(t). Requires: (1) extend Formula inductive type with stability constructor, (2) define semantics in TaskModel, (3) add S5(box-dot) axiom schemas (T, 4, B, K), (4) prove box implies box-dot (absorption), (5) prove box-dot commutes with box but NOT with G/H. Per research-002 Section 6: box-dot and G have no valid interaction axioms due to genuine branching.

---

### 992. Implement Shift-Closed Tense S5 Algebra representation theorem
- **Effort**: TBD
- **Status**: [RESEARCHED]
- **Language**: lean
- **Research**: [01_stsa-algebraic-analysis.md](992_shift_closed_tense_s5_algebra/reports/01_stsa-algebraic-analysis.md)

**Description**: Implement the Shift-Closed Tense S5 Algebra (STSA) representation theorem. Define STSA as a Lean structure extending BooleanAlgebra with box, G, H, sigma operators and interaction axioms. Lift temporal duality sigma from swap_temporal to the Lindenbaum quotient. Prove LindenbaumAlg is an STSA instance by wiring existing pieces (BooleanStructure, InteriorOperators, UltrafilterMCS). Restructure ParametricRepresentation into unified STSA representation theorem. Research report 001 provides complete algebraic analysis with ~80% of formalization already existing.

---

### 991. Irreflexive semantics refactoring and STSA representation theorem
- **Effort**: 5 hours
- **Status**: [COMPLETED]
- **Language**: lean
- **Research**: [research-002.md](991_temporal_algebraic_representation/reports/research-002.md), [research-003-irreflexive-refactoring-plan.md](991_temporal_algebraic_representation/reports/research-003-irreflexive-refactoring-plan.md), [04_synthesis.md](991_temporal_algebraic_representation/reports/04_synthesis.md), [05_extension-lattice-analysis.md](991_temporal_algebraic_representation/reports/05_extension-lattice-analysis.md), [06_irreflexivity-rigorous-analysis.md](991_temporal_algebraic_representation/reports/06_irreflexivity-rigorous-analysis.md), [07_axiom-vs-irr-analysis.md](991_temporal_algebraic_representation/reports/07_axiom-vs-irr-analysis.md), [08_discrete-completeness-strict-semantics.md](991_temporal_algebraic_representation/reports/08_discrete-completeness-strict-semantics.md)
- **Plan**: [04_seriality-based-completion.md](991_temporal_algebraic_representation/plans/04_seriality-based-completion.md)
- **Started**: 2026-03-18
- **Completed**: 2026-03-18
- **Summary**: [05_seriality-completion-summary.md](991_temporal_algebraic_representation/summaries/05_seriality-completion-summary.md)

**Description**: Refactor the ProofChecker codebase from reflexive (≤/≥) to irreflexive (</>)
temporal semantics, and build a Shift-Closed Tense S5 Algebra (STSA) representation theorem. Under current reflexive semantics, density/seriality/discreteness axioms are trivially valid on all frames, making parametric representation theorems for distinct frame classes impossible. Switching to irreflexive semantics makes these axioms genuinely characterize their respective frame classes, simplifies the codebase (eliminates the ~1200-line Gabbay IRR proof, removes reflexive case branches), and enables a clean algebraic variety representation theorem. Research report 003 provides a complete file-by-file change specification.

### 990. Research representation theorem design for parametric durations
- **Effort**: 6 hours
- **Status**: [COMPLETED]
- **Language**: formal
- **Research**: [01_teammate-a-findings.md](990_representation_theorem_duration_design/reports/01_teammate-a-findings.md), [01_teammate-b-findings.md](990_representation_theorem_duration_design/reports/01_teammate-b-findings.md), [02_synthesis.md](990_representation_theorem_duration_design/reports/02_synthesis.md)
- **Plan**: [01_parametric-duration-architecture.md](990_representation_theorem_duration_design/plans/01_parametric-duration-architecture.md)
- **Summary**: [01_architecture-decision-summary.md](990_representation_theorem_duration_design/summaries/01_architecture-decision-summary.md)
- **Started**: 2026-03-17
- **Completed**: 2026-03-17

**Description**: Research how representation theorems for TM base logic and its dense/discrete extensions should handle durations D. The key question: should D be constructed from pure syntax, or should D be parametric with axioms (density, discreteness, or linear commutative group) constraining its structure? Conduct systematic research into existing results in modal logic completeness (algebraic and Henkin-style approaches) to inform the mathematically correct design, then implement the recommended architecture.

---

### 989. Discrete algebraic completeness
- **Effort**: TBD
- **Status**: [BLOCKED]
- **Blocked on**: Task 995 (FMCS domain transfer lemma), Task 974 (SuccOrder instance)
- **Language**: lean

**Description**: Prove discrete algebraic completeness using D = Int. Requires: (1) FMCS domain transfer from CanonicalMCS to Int (task 995), (2) proving DF and DP axioms are valid in `DiscreteCanonicalTaskFrame Int` (the parametric canonical TaskFrame instantiated at Int), (3) SuccOrder instance on DiscreteTimelineQuot (task 974, archived), (4) wiring `discrete_representation_conditional` to obtain `valid_discrete φ → ⊢_discrete φ`. Note: `DiscreteInstantiation.lean` uses live parametric infrastructure (`ParametricCanonicalTaskFrame Int`), not the deprecated `DiscreteTimeline.discreteCanonicalTaskFrame`.

---

### 988. Dense algebraic completeness
- **Effort**: 16 hours (4 phases)
- **Status**: [BLOCKED]
- **Blocked on**: Task 995 (FMCS domain transfer lemma)
- **Language**: lean
- **Research**: [research-001.md](specs/988_dense_algebraic_completeness/reports/research-001.md), [research-002.md](specs/988_dense_algebraic_completeness/reports/research-002.md), [research-003.md](specs/988_dense_algebraic_completeness/reports/research-003.md), [research-004.md](specs/988_dense_algebraic_completeness/reports/research-004.md), [research-005.md](specs/988_dense_algebraic_completeness/reports/research-005.md), [06_team-research.md](specs/988_dense_algebraic_completeness/reports/06_team-research.md)
- **Plan**: [06_representation-theorem-path.md](specs/988_dense_algebraic_completeness/plans/06_representation-theorem-path.md) (v6: Fix sorries, transport, wire)
- **Handoff**: [phase-1-handoff-20260317.md](specs/988_dense_algebraic_completeness/handoffs/phase-1-handoff-20260317.md)
- **Summary**: [implementation-summary-20260317.md](specs/988_dense_algebraic_completeness/summaries/implementation-summary-20260317.md), [02_implementation-summary.md](specs/988_dense_algebraic_completeness/summaries/02_implementation-summary.md) (v4 plan blocked), [03_sorry-analysis-summary.md](specs/988_dense_algebraic_completeness/summaries/03_sorry-analysis-summary.md) (v6 plan blocked), [04_architectural-gap-analysis.md](specs/988_dense_algebraic_completeness/summaries/04_architectural-gap-analysis.md) (v9 plan blocked)

**Status note (2026-03-19)**: Plans v4, v6, and v9 all blocked at Phase 1 due to the same fundamental issue: CanonicalMCS (sorry-free BFMCS) lacks AddCommGroup for TaskFrame D. The correct path is via task 995 (FMCS domain transfer): transfer the sorry-free CanonicalMCS construction to D = Rat via Cantor isomorphism (CanonicalMCS antisymmetrization ≃o ℚ). All temporal coherence components are already proven.

**Description**: Prove dense algebraic completeness using D = Rat. Requires: (1) a sorry-free BFMCS construction over Rat (adapting the Int construction with density-exploiting witness placement), (2) proving the DN axiom is valid in `DenseCanonicalTaskFrame Rat` (Rat's density gives the required intermediate witnesses), (3) wiring `dense_representation_conditional` to obtain `valid_dense φ → ⊢_dense φ`. Does not overlap with task 982 (TimelineQuot approach).

---

### 987. Algebraic base completeness
- **Effort**: TBD
- **Status**: [ABANDONED]
- **Abandoned**: 2026-03-19
- **Language**: lean
- **Depends On**: Task 986 [ARCHIVED]
- **Superseded By**: Task 995 (FMCS domain transfer lemma)
- **Research**: [research-001.md](specs/987_algebraic_base_completeness/reports/research-001.md)

**Abandonment reason**: Task 986 (dependency) is archived with 2 unresolvable sorries (forward_F/backward_P for D=Int). The CanonicalMCS path (sorry-free) cannot serve as D due to missing AddCommGroup. Task 995 (FMCS domain transfer) supersedes this by providing the general bridge from sorry-free CanonicalMCS to any D with AddCommGroup via order-embedding. Base completeness becomes a corollary of task 995 (embed into ℤ).

**Description**: Wire algebraic base completeness: use the sorry-free BFMCS construction from task 986 as the `construct_bfmcs` argument to `parametric_algebraic_representation_conditional` (D = Int), then prove `valid φ → ⊢ φ`. Resolve any type mismatch between `CanonicalWorldState` and `ParametricCanonicalWorldState`. Create `AlgebraicBaseCompleteness.lean` with the closed completeness theorem.

### 985. Develop Lindenbaum-Tarski algebraic representation theorem approach
- **Effort**: 12 hours (6 phases)
- **Status**: [COMPLETED]
- **Completed**: 2026-03-17
- **Language**: logic
- **Research**: [research-001.md](specs/985_lindenbaum_tarski_representation_theorem/reports/research-001.md) (team: algebraic approach), [research-002.md](specs/985_lindenbaum_tarski_representation_theorem/reports/research-002.md) (TaskFrame-specific algebraic construction)
- **Plan**: [implementation-001.md](specs/985_lindenbaum_tarski_representation_theorem/plans/implementation-001.md)
- **Summary**: [implementation-summary-20260316.md](specs/985_lindenbaum_tarski_representation_theorem/summaries/implementation-summary-20260316.md)

**Description**: Develop the purely algebraic Lindenbaum-Tarski approach to establishing a representation theorem for the base TM logic as well as both the dense and discrete extensions in parallel to the existing proof. Research how this should proceed, drawing on the existing completeness results for guidance.

**Completion Summary**: Implemented D-parametric Lindenbaum-Tarski algebraic representation theorem. Created 6 new Lean modules (ParametricCanonical, ParametricHistory, ParametricTruthLemma, ParametricRepresentation, DenseInstantiation, DiscreteInstantiation) with zero sorries.

### 984. Review and revise documentation to remove `.claude/` directory references
- **Effort**: 1.5 hours (4 phases)
- **Status**: [COMPLETED]
- **Completed**: 2026-03-17
- **Language**: general
- **Research**: [research-001.md](specs/984_review_docs_remove_claude_dir_references/reports/research-001.md)
- **Plan**: [implementation-001.md](specs/984_review_docs_remove_claude_dir_references/plans/implementation-001.md)
- **Summary**: [implementation-summary-20260316.md](specs/984_review_docs_remove_claude_dir_references/summaries/implementation-summary-20260316.md)

**Description**: Review and revise all documentation to remove references to the `.claude/` directory (now gitignored), while preserving references to Claude Code itself.

**Completion Summary**: Removed 17 `.claude/` references from 6 documentation files, deleted 75K-line export file. Claude Code product name preserved throughout.


### 983. Review decidability results and FMP for publication
- **Effort**: 48 hours (8 phases)
- **Status**: [COMPLETED]
- **Completed**: 2026-03-17
- **Language**: logic
- **Research**: [research-001.md](specs/983_review_decidability_fmp_completeness/reports/research-001.md) (team), [research-002.md](specs/983_review_decidability_fmp_completeness/reports/research-002.md) (Boneyard salvageability)
- **Plan**: [implementation-002.md](specs/983_review_decidability_fmp_completeness/plans/implementation-002.md) (v2: clean FMP from scratch, no bridges, unified naming)
- **Summary**: [implementation-summary-20260316.md](specs/983_review_decidability_fmp_completeness/summaries/implementation-summary-20260316.md)

**Description**: Review the decidability results that have been established, and what remains to be done to establish the FMP and all natural decidability results that we might aim to establish alongside soundness and completeness, researching and implementing any missing results at the highest level of quality for the purposes of publication.

**Completion Summary**: Proved FMP for TM bimodal logic using MCS-based filtration. Created 8 Lean modules with zero sorries and zero axioms. Key theorems: mcs_finite_model_property, fmp_contrapositive, fmp_completeness.

### 982. Wire dense completeness domain connection
- **Effort**: 22 hours (6 phases)
- **Status**: [COMPLETED]
- **Language**: lean
- **Priority**: high
- **Created**: 2026-03-16 (Review)
- **Completed**: 2026-03-17
- **Research**: [research-009.md](specs/982_wire_dense_completeness_domain_connection/reports/research-009.md) (W vs D), [research-013.md](specs/982_wire_dense_completeness_domain_connection/reports/research-013.md) (gap analysis), [15_team-research.md](specs/982_wire_dense_completeness_domain_connection/reports/15_team-research.md) (team analysis), [16_dovetailing-analysis.md](specs/982_wire_dense_completeness_domain_connection/reports/16_dovetailing-analysis.md) (dovetailing deep-dive), [17_blocker-resolution.md](specs/982_wire_dense_completeness_domain_connection/reports/17_blocker-resolution.md) (blocker resolution)
- **Plan**: [11_density-resolution.md](specs/982_wire_dense_completeness_domain_connection/plans/11_density-resolution.md) (v11: Density argument)
- **Summary**: [03_density-resolution-summary.md](specs/982_wire_dense_completeness_domain_connection/summaries/03_density-resolution-summary.md)

**Completion Summary**: Proved dense completeness via full dovetailing. Created DovetailedCoverage.lean with sorry-free has_future/has_past theorems using density argument (F^i formulas with unbounded encodings). Created DovetailedCompleteness.lean wiring to TimelineQuot-based completeness.

**Description**: Complete dense completeness using W/D separated TaskFrame architecture: W = CanonicalMCS (world states), D = TimelineQuot (durations). Witnesses exist in W, not necessarily in Range(h).

**Research Summary**: The semantics has TWO distinct components: W (world states) and D (durations). Previous approaches conflated these. With separation: D = TimelineQuot (linear order), W = CanonicalMCS (all MCSs). Modal witnesses exist in W, making staged construction edge cases irrelevant.

**Resolution Path**:
1. Verify semantics architecture supports W/D separation (Phase 1)
2. Build separated TaskFrame: D = TimelineQuot, W = CanonicalMCS (Phase 2)
3. Build WorldHistories h : D → W (Phase 3)
4. Prove truth lemma with witnesses in W (Phase 4)
5. Complete dense completeness theorem (Phase 5)

**Files to create/modify**:
- `Metalogic/Algebraic/SeparatedTaskFrame.lean` - NEW
- `Metalogic/Algebraic/SeparatedHistory.lean` - NEW
- `Metalogic/Algebraic/SeparatedTruthLemma.lean` - NEW
- `FrameConditions/Completeness.lean` - MODIFIED

### 981. Remove axiom technical debt from task 979
- **Effort**: 4-6 hours (4 phases)
- **Status**: [ABANDONED]
- **Abandoned**: 2026-03-19
- **Language**: lean
- **Depends On**: Task 978 [COMPLETED]
- **Superseded By**: Task 995 (FMCS domain transfer lemma)
- **Research**: [research-001.md](specs/981_remove_axiom_technical_debt_from_task_979/reports/research-001.md), [research-002.md](specs/981_remove_axiom_technical_debt_from_task_979/reports/research-002.md) (team: constructive method path), [research-003.md](specs/981_remove_axiom_technical_debt_from_task_979/reports/research-003.md) (team: blocker resolution), [research-004.md](specs/981_remove_axiom_technical_debt_from_task_979/reports/research-004.md) (team: T-axiom path), [research-005.md](specs/981_remove_axiom_technical_debt_from_task_979/reports/research-005.md) (blocker analysis), [research-006.md](specs/981_remove_axiom_technical_debt_from_task_979/reports/research-006.md) (axiom elimination approaches), [research-007.md](specs/981_remove_axiom_technical_debt_from_task_979/reports/research-007.md) (covering proof gap confirmed unfillable), [research-008.md](specs/981_remove_axiom_technical_debt_from_task_979/reports/research-008.md) (world history discreteness - W=D equivalence), [research-009.md](specs/981_remove_axiom_technical_debt_from_task_979/reports/research-009.md) (architectural clarity - W=D is simplification), [research-010.md](specs/981_remove_axiom_technical_debt_from_task_979/reports/research-010.md) (team: W=D is fundamental error), [research-011.md](specs/981_remove_axiom_technical_debt_from_task_979/reports/research-011.md) (post-task 991 assessment), [24_synthesis-report.md](specs/981_remove_axiom_technical_debt_from_task_979/reports/24_synthesis-report.md) (DEAD END: forward-only approach), [25_correct-truth-lemma-approaches.md](specs/981_remove_axiom_technical_debt_from_task_979/reports/25_correct-truth-lemma-approaches.md) (CORRECT: wire dovetailed coverage for BFMCS temporal coherence)
- **Plan**: [13_coverage-based-approach.md](specs/981_remove_axiom_technical_debt_from_task_979/plans/13_coverage-based-approach.md) (v13: Coverage-based - prove dovetailed_covers_reachable by induction on CanonicalR chain length)

**Abandonment reason**: After 25 research reports, 13 plans, and multiple implementation attempts, every approach to removing the `discrete_Icc_finite_axiom` hits the same fundamental wall: the covering proof requires showing that dovetailed construction reaches all CanonicalR-reachable MCSes, but density arguments can arbitrarily increase formula depth, defeating all termination measures. The axiom is mathematically justified (Icc finiteness holds in any discrete linear order with SuccOrder) and documented as intentional technical debt. The axiom does NOT block any completeness path — the CanonicalMCS-based construction (sorry-free, in CanonicalFMCS.lean) bypasses it entirely. Task 995 (FMCS domain transfer) provides the correct architectural path forward.

**Description**: Task 979 incurred technical debt (accepting an axiom temporarily). After completing the systematic refactor in task 978, research the problem deeply, implement the mathematically correct solution, and remove the axiom to yield a debt-free repository.

### 953. Refactor proof system to bilateral system
- **Effort**: 55-90 hours
- **Status**: [RESEARCHED]
- **Language**: lean
- **Priority**: medium
- **Research**: [research-001.md](specs/953_refactor_proof_system_to_bilateral/reports/research-001.md), [research-002.md](specs/953_refactor_proof_system_to_bilateral/reports/research-002.md), [research-003.md](specs/953_refactor_proof_system_to_bilateral/reports/research-003.md)

**Description**: Refactor the TM proof system from a unilateral system (single judgment `Γ ⊢ φ`) to a bilateral system with dual judgments: acceptance (`Γ ⊢⁺ φ`) and rejection (`Γ ⊢⁻ φ`). The bilateral system makes the dual roles of assertion and denial explicit, with rules governing how acceptance and rejection interact across all connectives and operators. Key design: keep Formula type unchanged (Option A), add BilateralDeriv alongside existing DerivationTree with a proven equivalence bridge. Several current axioms (ex_falso, peirce, modal_t, temp_t_future, temp_t_past) become structural rules in the bilateral system. The existing signed formula infrastructure in the decidability module provides the blueprint.

**Research summary (research-003)**: Cost-benefit analysis recommends deferring bilateral refactor until higher-priority tasks (981: axiom debt, 951: completeness) progress. Benefits are primarily theoretical (assertion/denial duality, tableau alignment); existing unilateral system is adequate. Parallel-system approach (Option A) minimizes risk.

**Implementation approach**: Parallel bilateral system with equivalence bridge — not a replacement. Phase 1: bilateral infrastructure (BilateralContext, BilateralDeriv). Phase 2: prove equivalence with unilateral system. Phase 3: bilateral metalogic (MCS, FMCS, completeness). Phase 4: bilateral decidability integration.

### 949. Update Demo.lean for current bimodal logic state
- **Effort**: Small (~2 hours)
- **Status**: [RESEARCHED]
- **Language**: lean
- **Research**: [research-001.md](specs/949_update_demo_lean_bimodal_logic/reports/research-001.md)

**Description**: Update Theories/Bimodal/Examples/Demo.lean given the current state of the bimodal logic. The demo file should reflect the current API and showcase the working features of the bimodal logic implementation.

### 868. Reinstate lean-lsp MCP tools after GitHub issue resolution
- **Effort**: 1 hour
- **Status**: [ABANDONED]
- **Abandoned**: 2026-03-19
- **Language**: meta
- **Created**: 2026-02-11

**Abandonment reason**: The lean-lsp MCP tools have been reinstated and are actively working in the current project configuration (`.mcp.json`). Tools like `lean_goal`, `lean_hover_info`, `lean_completions`, `lean_diagnostic_messages`, etc. are all functional and used regularly in implementation sessions. Issue #115 (server hanging after import edits) is a minor inconvenience with a known workaround (use `lake build` for authoritative diagnostics). The task's premise — that tools are blocked and need reinstatement — is no longer accurate.

### 619. Migrate skills to native context:fork isolation
- **Effort**: 3 hours
- **Status**: [PLANNING]
- **Researched**: 2026-02-17
- **Language**: meta
- **Created**: 2026-01-19
- **Researched**: 2026-01-28
- **Planned**: 2026-01-19
- **Blocked on**: GitHub anthropics/claude-code #16803 (context:fork runs inline instead of forking)
- **Research**: [research-001.md](specs/archive/619_agent_system_architecture_upgrade/reports/research-001.md), [research-006.md](specs/archive/619_agent_system_architecture_upgrade/reports/research-006.md), [research-007.md](specs/619_agent_system_architecture_upgrade/reports/research-007.md)
- **Plan**: [implementation-002.md](specs/archive/619_agent_system_architecture_upgrade/plans/implementation-002.md)

**Description**: Migrate all delegation skills from manual Task tool invocation to native `context: fork` frontmatter. Skills to migrate: skill-researcher, skill-lean-research, skill-planner, skill-implementer, skill-lean-implementation, skill-latex-implementation, skill-meta. Implementation plan has 3 phases: (1) verify bug fix with test skill, (2) migrate skill-researcher as pilot, (3) migrate remaining skills. Current workaround (Task tool delegation) continues to work. **Unblock when**: GitHub #16803 is closed AND fix verified locally. Last checked: 2026-02-17 — still OPEN (v2.1.32).
