Phase 4 (saturation fixed point) was entirely skipped; single-history construction was used instead, trivializing modal semantics (Box phi = phi). 28 sorries remain across FDSM module. Core blocker is witness_set_consistent which requires modal necessitation proof. Estimated 11-17 hours to complete proper multi-history implementation.",
