    "details": "Phase 1 partially completed. Cleaned up dead code (removed 3 abandoned definitions with sorry). Proved forward_G for non-negative Int pairs and backward_H for non-positive Int pairs via Nat-indexed chain lemmas. Identified fundamental mathematical difficulty: GContent/HContent two-chain construction cannot prove cross-sign forward_G/backward_H because Lindenbaum can introduce new G/H formulas. F/P witnessing requires dovetailing which has seed consistency challenges. 4 sorries remain (down from 7)."
