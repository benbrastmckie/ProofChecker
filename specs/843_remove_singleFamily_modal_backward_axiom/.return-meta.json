  "summary": "Analyzed cross-sign propagation blocking issue in DovetailingChain.lean. The two-chain architecture cannot support cross-sign G/H propagation due to one-directional Lindenbaum extension. Evaluated three alternatives: interleaved chain (15-20h, medium-high risk), global Zorn (20-30h, high risk), deferral (0h, maintains debt). Recommended deferral since Phase 4 (critical goal) is complete. Task 865 recommendations remain valid - no changes needed.",
