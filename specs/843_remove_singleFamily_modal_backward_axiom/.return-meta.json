Counterexample: {F(psi), neg(psi)} is consistent but cannot be extended to a temporally-saturated MCS (TemporalForwardSaturated requires F(psi) in M implies psi in M, contradicting neg(psi) in M). The constant-family temporal saturation approach needs fundamental rethinking. No code changes made.",
