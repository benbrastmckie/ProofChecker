Counterexample: Box(atom p) is consistent but not provable, so MCS exist both with and without Box(atom p). The plan conflated a property of the S5 canonical model (universal accessibility) with a property of arbitrary MCS (which don't satisfy it). Plan requires revision before Phase 2 can proceed."
