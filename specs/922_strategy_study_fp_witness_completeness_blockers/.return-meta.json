  "summary": "Investigated why LinearOrder and AddCommGroup are unused in completeness chain: LinearOrder is only needed for soundness (le_total for linearity axiom), AddCommGroup is only needed for time_shift in soundness. The completeness chain correctly abstracts these away. The canonical model uses trivial task_rel, which is standard practice. The forward_F/backward_P blocker is fundamentally caused by forcing the canonical model (a preorder of MCSes) into a linear ordering (via Antisymmetrization quotient), losing individual formula membership. The recommended resolution is generalizing BFMCS from LinearOrder to Preorder and using CanonicalReachable directly as the domain.",
