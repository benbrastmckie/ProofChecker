  "summary": "Blocker analysis complete. Quotient representative mismatch is fundamental to Antisymmetrization approach -- phi membership cannot propagate between equivalent representatives (only G-formulas do via GContent). Recommended resolution: Option 1 (generalize BFMCS from LinearOrder to Preorder, use CanonicalReachable directly). LinearOrder is never used in proofs (only type constraints). Changing forward_G/backward_H from strict (<) to reflexive (<=) enables working with CanonicalReachable's natural Preorder, eliminating the quotient entirely and making forward_F/backward_P trivially provable.",
