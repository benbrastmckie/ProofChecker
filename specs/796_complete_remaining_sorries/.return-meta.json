Remaining sorries fall into: semantic validity issues (4), omega-rule limitations (6), box case architectural limits (4), coherent construction (15), MCS properties (6), task relation (5), canonical history (2), decidability (6), finite canonical model (50+), and Logos (1). Recommended priority: MCS property proofs first, then coherent construction seeds.",
