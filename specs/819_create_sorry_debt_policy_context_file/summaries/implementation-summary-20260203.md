# Implementation Summary: Task #819

**Completed**: 2026-02-03
**Duration**: Single session

## Changes Made

Created comprehensive sorry debt policy context file for agent guidance on handling `sorry` statements in Lean 4 proofs. The policy covers philosophy, categories, remediation paths, discovery protocol, Boneyard references, and metrics integration.

## Files Created

- `.claude/context/project/lean4/standards/sorry-debt-policy.md` - Main policy file (127 lines)

## Content Summary

The policy file includes:

1. **Philosophy**: Sorries as mathematical debt, transitive inheritance concept, publication requirements
2. **Sorry Categories**: Construction assumptions, development placeholders, documentation examples, fundamental obstacles
3. **Remediation Paths**: Proof completion, architectural refactoring, Boneyard archival with decision criteria
4. **Discovery Protocol**: Step-by-step guidance with transitive impact check and decision tree
5. **Boneyard References**: Primary and overflow locations, README requirements
6. **Metrics Integration**: sorry_count computation pattern, status thresholds
7. **Usage Checklist**: Agent action items

## Verification

- File exists at correct path: Yes
- Line count under 150: Yes (127 lines)
- Cross-references valid: Yes (all 3 referenced files exist)
- No conflicts with proof-conventions-lean.md: Yes (complementary, not contradictory)

## Notes

The file complements the brief sorry policy in `proof-conventions-lean.md` by providing comprehensive guidance for agents. The transitive inheritance concept is explained once as the canonical definition.
