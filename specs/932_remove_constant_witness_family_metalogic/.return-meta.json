Proves the fundamental tension is irresolvable: constant witness families cannot be temporally coherent under standard recursive truth semantics, regardless of domain choice. Recommends keeping sorry-backed theorem and focusing future work on DovetailingChain F/P fixes or alternative proof architecture."
