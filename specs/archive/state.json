Truth lemma assumed only needed for eval family - hits dead end for complex formulas\n3. Taking all MCSs to form a single canonical family does not work\n\nThe correct path:\n1. Define MCSs as world states\n2. Define four-constraint accessibility relation: one MCS related to another iff whenever Box G phi is in the left MCS, then phi is in the right MCS\n3. Define families as functions Int -> MCS where each MCS sees the next MCS or is seen by the previous MCS (using the accessibility relation)\n4. This constructs a bundle of families resembling world histories\n5. Prove every consistent sentence belongs to an MCS at time 0 in some family\n6. Establish TruthLemma: sentence belongs to MCS in family iff sentence is true when evaluated at that family at the corresponding integer\n\nThis construction is the core of the representation theorem.
