# Implementation Summary - Task 505 Bimodal Metalogic Restructuring

Implemented core infrastructure for Representation First architecture of bimodal metalogic following Task 502 context-based provability. Created Core/Basic.lean with consistency, validity, and maximal consistent set definitions using List-based contexts to avoid artificial finiteness constraints. Established Representation/ directory with CanonicalModel.lean containing maximal consistent set structure and canonical model construction, TruthLemma.lean with detailed truth evaluation proofs, and RepresentationTheorem.lean proving consistency implies satisfiability via canonical model. Added Completeness/CompletenessTheorem.lean and Applications/Compactness.lean deriving standard metalogical results from representation theorem. Created Representation/FiniteModelProperty.lean bridging representation theory with existing decidability modules via filtration. All modules maintain compatibility with existing Soundness and Decidability implementations while establishing clear architectural hierarchy: Core → Soundness → Representation → Completeness/Decidability. Implementation addresses circular dependencies through careful import structure and uses Lean 4 idioms throughout.
