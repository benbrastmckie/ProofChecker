  "summary": "Research completed for indexed family coherence conditions. Analyzed four coherence condition sorries (lines 433, 439, 448, 456) in IndexedMCSFamily.lean. Identified proof strategies using temporal axioms (Temporal 4, Temporal K distribution). Forward_G and backward_H are directly provable from seed construction (5-7 hours). Forward_H and backward_G require MCS negation completeness lemma (additional 4-5 hours prerequisite). Created comprehensive report with phased proof strategy, case analysis patterns, and dependency analysis.",
