Identifies three viable paths: constant-family truth lemma, two-tier BMCS, or fixing DovetailingChain sorries. The fundamental blocker is that constant witness families cannot satisfy temporal coherence (backward G requires phi -> G(phi) which is not a valid inference), requiring either truth lemma restructuring or non-constant witness families."
