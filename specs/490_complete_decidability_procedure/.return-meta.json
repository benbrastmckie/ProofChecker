Reduced Saturation.lean sorries from 4 to 2 by proving all foldl-related helper lemmas (foldl_add_mono, foldl_filter_le, foldl_conditional_mono, foldl_conditional_ge_init) and completing the unexpanded_contributes theorem. Phases 3-4 (tableau_complete, decide_complete) remain blocked due to missing FMP-tableau connection infrastructure. Lake build succeeds with 7 documented sorries across Decidability modules.",
