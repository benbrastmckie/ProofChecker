  "summary": "Deep analysis confirms temporal and modal sorries have fundamentally different root causes. Multi-family construction (Strategy C) can ONLY resolve the modal_backward sorry, NOT the temporal sorries. Temporal sorries are blocked by the omega-rule limitation (infinitary reasoning) and cannot be resolved by any multi-family approach. Simplest viable path: accept all 3 sorries as construction axioms (completeness uses only forward truth lemma anyway). Alternative: implement multi-family for modal only.",
