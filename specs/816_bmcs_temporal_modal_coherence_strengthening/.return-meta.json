  "summary": "A fully sorry-free biconditional truth lemma is not achievable through the hybrid strategy alone due to the fundamental omega-rule limitation for temporal operators. The contrapositive approach using witness extraction shifts but does not eliminate the problem. However, the completeness theorem only uses truth_lemma_forward, making temporal sorries acceptable as construction axioms. Recommendation: accept temporal sorries as mathematically sound, implement multi-family construction for the modal sorry.",
