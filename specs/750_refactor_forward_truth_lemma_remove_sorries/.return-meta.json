  "partial_progress": {
    "stage": "research_complete",
    "details": "Analyzed algebraic vs Kripke semantics gap. Found: ultrafilters ARE propositional (no time structure) but this is standard for algebraic modal logic. The gap exists but is bridged by Representation path, not algebraic path. Completeness proof works via canonical model construction."
  },
  "findings": {
    "semantic_gap_exists": true,
    "gap_is_problematic": false,
    "explanation": "The algebraic approach proves AlgSatisfiable <-> AlgConsistent, not standard validity. This is intentional - the completeness proof uses the Representation path which constructs actual TaskModels with time structure.",
    "propositional_ultrafilters_concern": "Valid observation but not a bug. Ultrafilters encode temporal operators via G_quot/H_quot but don't have explicit time domains. The bijection MCS <-> Ultrafilter preserves logical structure.",
    "completeness_path": "Uses Representation path (canonical model) NOT algebraic path. The truth_lemma_forward is sufficient for completeness.",
    "recommendation": "Continue with task 750 as planned - focus on Representation path sorries. Algebraic-semantic bridge would be a separate 2-4 week project."
