  "summary": "Deep analysis reveals MCS-restricted truth lemma is the most promising approach. The gap in truth_at_implies_semantic_truth is architectural: IsLocallyConsistent only provides modus ponens direction, while MCS-derived states have full propositional closure via closure_mcs_imp_iff. Recommended implementation: create MCSDerivedWorldState subtype, prove truth lemma by structural induction using existing closure_mcs_imp_iff, connect to completeness. Estimated 8-12 hours.",
