  "summary": "Evaluated 5 approaches for sorry-free completeness with focus on syntactic completeness. Syntactic completeness (pure proof-theoretic) is not viable without building sequent calculus from scratch (4-8 weeks). Most viable path is Option 3: FMP Path via semantic_weak_completeness (1-2 weeks), which requires proving truth_at coincides with assignment truth for MCS-derived world states. Option 4 (fix Representation path) is second priority (2-3 weeks). The existing MCS approach IS the standard Henkin-style syntactic method for modal logic.",
