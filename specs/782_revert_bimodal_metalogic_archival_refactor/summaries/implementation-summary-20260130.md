# Implementation Summary: Task #782

**Completed**: 2026-01-30
**Duration**: ~30 minutes

## Changes Made

Reverted the `Theories/Bimodal/` directory to its pre-archival state at commit `08754f0b`. This removed the Boneyard directory and all archival-period changes, restoring the original Metalogic structure that focuses on `weak_completeness` rather than the mistaken `semantic_weak_completeness` approach.

## Files Modified

### Removed Directories
- `Theories/Bimodal/Boneyard/` - Entire archival directory removed (contained Metalogic, Metalogic_v2, Metalogic_v3, Metalogic_v4)
- `Theories/Bimodal/typst/` - Documentation directory added during archival period removed
- `Theories/Bimodal/Metalogic/Algebraic/` - Archival-period subdirectory removed
- `Theories/Bimodal/Metalogic/Core/` - Archival-period subdirectory removed
- `Theories/Bimodal/Metalogic/FMP/` - Archival-period subdirectory removed
- `Theories/Bimodal/Metalogic/Representation/` - Archival-period subdirectory removed
- `Theories/Bimodal/Metalogic/Soundness/` - Archival-period subdirectory removed
- `Theories/Bimodal/Metalogic/UnderDevelopment/` - Archival-period subdirectory removed

### Removed Files
- `Theories/Bimodal/Examples/Demo.lean` - Added during archival period
- `Theories/Bimodal/Syntax/Subformulas.lean` - Added during archival period
- `Theories/Bimodal/Metalogic/FMP.lean` - Archival-period addition
- `Theories/Bimodal/Metalogic/Metalogic.lean` - Archival-period addition
- `Theories/Bimodal/Metalogic/README.md` - Archival-period addition
- `Theories/Bimodal/Metalogic/Completeness/Completeness.lean` - Archival-period addition
- `Theories/Bimodal/Metalogic/Completeness/FiniteStrongCompleteness.lean` - Archival-period addition
- `Theories/Bimodal/Metalogic/Completeness/README.md` - Archival-period addition
- `Theories/Bimodal/Metalogic/Completeness/WeakCompleteness.lean` - Archival-period addition
- Various latex build artifacts

### Restored Structure
The `Theories/Bimodal/Metalogic/` directory now has the original pre-archival structure:
```
Metalogic/
├── Completeness/
│   └── FiniteCanonicalModel.lean
├── Decidability/
│   ├── Closure.lean
│   ├── Correctness.lean
│   ├── CountermodelExtraction.lean
│   ├── DecisionProcedure.lean
│   ├── ProofExtraction.lean
│   ├── Saturation.lean
│   ├── SignedFormula.lean
│   └── Tableau.lean
├── Completeness.lean
├── Decidability.lean
├── DeductionTheorem.lean
├── Soundness.lean
└── SoundnessLemmas.lean
```

## Verification

- **Build**: `lake build` completed successfully (968 jobs, no errors)
- **File count**: 51 lean files in Bimodal, matching pre-archival state exactly
- **Directory structure**: Matches pre-archival commit `08754f0b`
- **Backup branch**: `backup/pre-revert-782` preserves previous state

## Notes

### Why This Reversion Was Needed
The archival refactor (starting with task 487) shifted focus to `semantic_weak_completeness` instead of the correct `weak_completeness` approach. This architectural mistake led to accumulated technical debt and documentation drift. Reverting to the pre-archival state provides a clean foundation for resuming work on the correct approach.

### Files Preserved
- All `.claude/` changes preserved (not part of reversion)
- All `specs/` changes preserved (not part of reversion)
- All `Theories/PropositionalLogic/` unchanged (not part of reversion)

### Future Work
After this reversion stabilizes, consider:
1. Reviewing commits from `08754f0b..HEAD` for valuable improvements worth re-applying
2. Resuming work on `weak_completeness` with the correct approach
3. Updating documentation to reflect the correct focus area
