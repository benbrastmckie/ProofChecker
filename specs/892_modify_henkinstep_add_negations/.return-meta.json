Counterexample: base={neg psi}, henkinLimit adds G(psi) consistently, resulting M is maximal in TCS but M union {F(psi)} is consistent (hence M is not MCS). The conflict arises because G(psi)->F(psi) is a theorem, so neither F(psi)'s package nor neg(F(psi)) can be consistently added, yet F(psi) not in M and insert F(psi) M is consistent.",

      "message": "The theorem maximal_tcs_is_mcs claims that a set maximal in TemporalConsistentSupersets is SetMaximalConsistent. This is false. Counterexample: M = {neg(psi), G(psi)} is maximal in TCS (adding F(psi) would require psi for saturation, but neg(psi) is present). However, M union {F(psi)} is consistent (semantically: psi false now, psi true at all future times). Thus M is maximal in TCS but not maximal consistent.",
