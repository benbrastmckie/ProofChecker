  "summary": "Analyzed three options for proving fully_saturated_bmcs_exists_int constructively. Option B (prove constant witness families from temporally saturated MCSes inherit temporal coherence) is most viable. Key insight: constant_family_temporally_saturated_is_coherent is already proven in SaturatedConstruction.lean. The challenge is ensuring witness construction preserves temporal saturation through Lindenbaum extension. Recommended path: prove lindenbaum_preserves_temporal_saturation, then modify exists_fullySaturated_extension to use temporally saturated seeds.",
