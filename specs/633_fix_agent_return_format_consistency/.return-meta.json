  "summary": "Identified contradictory return format instructions in latex-implementation-agent.md (and general-implementation-agent.md). Both agents have correct v2 file-based metadata in Stages 7-8 but outdated v1 JSON console output in Return Format Examples and Critical Requirements sections. The contradiction causes JSON to be dumped to console instead of written to .return-meta.json. Recommended fix is to update both agents' examples and requirements sections to match the v2 pattern used by lean-implementation-agent.md, plus add postflight validation to detect accidental JSON console output.",
