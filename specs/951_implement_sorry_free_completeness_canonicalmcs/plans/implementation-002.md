## Revision History

| Version | Date | Key Changes |
|---------|------|-------------|
| 001 | 2026-02-27 | Initial plan: antisymmetrization via Z-indexed dovetailing chain |
| 002 | 2026-02-27 | **Major revision**: Abandon chain approach for forward_F/backward_P. Use Bidirectional Reachable Fragment (Solution Path C from research-003.md) |

## Why Revision is Needed

**Root Cause Analysis (research-003.md)**: The linear chain approach in implementation-001.md is **mathematically impossible**:

1. **F-formula non-persistence**: F-formulas (`F(φ) = ¬G(¬φ)`) are NOT in GContent. Lindenbaum extensions can introduce `G(¬φ)`, killing `F(φ)` at any step.

2. **Structural impossibility**: No property of F-formulas can be derived from GContent-based chain ordering. The linearity axiom constrains membership within a single MCS but does NOT prevent Lindenbaum from making choices that kill F-obligations.

3. **Phases 1-2 COMPLETED**, **Phase 3 BLOCKED**: The chain infrastructure works, but `forward_F_dovetailed` is unprovable.

**Solution**: Use **Bidirectional Reachable Fragment** approach:
- Operate at CanonicalMCS level where forward_F and backward_P are trivially sorry-free
- Define bidirectional reachable fragment from root MCS
- Prove it's linearly ordered via linearity axiom
- Embed into Int
- Pull back FMCS to get `FMCS Int` with forward_F AND backward_P

## Overview

Implement sorry-free completeness by:
1. Using `canonicalMCS_forward_F` and `canonicalMCS_backward_P` (already sorry-free in CanonicalFMCS.lean)
2. Constructing the **bidirectional reachable fragment** from any root MCS
3. Proving this fragment is linearly ordered (via linearity axiom)
4. Embedding into Int via Antisymmetrization + Mathlib infrastructure
5. Pulling back the FMCS structure to get `FMCS Int`

This avoids the F-persistence problem entirely by not relying on chain construction for forward_F/backward_P.

## Goals & Non-Goals

**Goals**:
- Eliminate sorries in completeness chain via embedding approach
- Prove forward_F and backward_P by transfer from CanonicalMCS level
- Achieve modal saturation via witness families (same construction per family)
- Bridge to standard `valid` with `FMCS Int`
- Maintain zero new sorries

**Non-Goals**:
- Fixing the chain-based approach (proven impossible)
- Generalizing semantics to Preorder D
- Modifying DovetailingChain.lean (keep as deprecated)

## Preserved Infrastructure from v001

**From Phase 1 (COMPLETED)**: CanonicalChain.lean (857 lines) contains:
- `CanonicalChain` structure with Z-indexed MCS
- Monotonicity and GContent/HContent inclusion proofs
- FMCS conversion infrastructure

**From Phase 2 (COMPLETED)**: Obligation enumeration in CanonicalChain.lean:
- `Obligation` inductive type
- Omega-squared diagonal enumeration
- Enriched chain construction with witness placement

**Note**: The enriched chain infrastructure remains useful for understanding but will NOT be used for forward_F/backward_P. The Bidirectional Reachable Fragment approach supersedes it.

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Bidirectional totality proof fails | High | Medium | Carefully trace paths through common ancestors; use linearity axiom |
| Mathlib embedding infrastructure insufficient | Medium | Low | Antisymmetrization + countable-to-Int embedding are standard |
| Modal saturation complexity | Medium | Medium | Each witness family uses same construction (parallelize) |
| Integration with existing BFMCS machinery | Medium | Low | Define new types, don't modify existing |
| Boneyard infrastructure needs significant adaptation | Medium | Medium | CanonicalReachable proven; generalize to bidirectional |

### Phase B: Prove Linearity of Bidirectional Fragment [NOT STARTED]

- **Dependencies**: Phase A
- **Goal**: Prove any two elements in BidirectionalReachable M₀ are CanonicalR-comparable

**Key Insight**: The linearity axiom ensures that elements reachable from a common ancestor are comparable. For bidirectional reachability, we need to show that mixed forward/backward paths still yield comparable endpoints.

**Tasks**:

- [ ] Define `bidirectional_path` type: sequence of CanonicalR or CanonicalR⁻¹ edges from M₀
- [ ] Prove path confluence: any two paths from M₀ to different endpoints share a common comparison point
- [ ] Prove `bidirectional_totally_ordered`: ∀ W₁ W₂ ∈ BidirectionalReachable M₀, CanonicalR W₁ W₂ ∨ CanonicalR W₂ W₁ ∨ W₁ = W₂
- [ ] Use `temp_linearity` axiom to establish ordering at each path junction

**Timing**: 10-15 hours (hardest phase)

- [ ] Prove `backward_P_in_fragment`: if W ∈ BidirectionalReachable M₀ and P(φ) ∈ W, then the witness W' from `canonical_backward_P` is also in BidirectionalReachable M₀
- [ ] These follow from closure properties in Phase A + witness existence in CanonicalFMCS.lean

## Artifacts & Outputs

- `Theories/Bimodal/Metalogic/Bundle/BidirectionalReachable.lean` - new module
- `Theories/Bimodal/Metalogic/Bundle/CanonicalCompleteness.lean` - new module (or integrate into existing)
- `specs/951_implement_sorry_free_completeness_canonicalmcs/plans/implementation-002.md` - this plan
- `specs/951_implement_sorry_free_completeness_canonicalmcs/summaries/implementation-summary-YYYYMMDD.md` - completion summary

## Rollback/Contingency

1. **Phase B fails** (totality proof): This is the highest-risk phase. If it fails:
   - Try alternate totality argument (e.g., path induction)
   - Consider restricting to forward-only reachable + separate backward construction
   - Mark [BLOCKED] for user review

2. **Embedding fails**: Mathlib infrastructure is mature; unlikely. Fallback: direct countable enumeration.

3. **Modal saturation complex**: Each family is independent; can parallelize or serialize.

4. **Infrastructure from v001**: The CanonicalChain.lean infrastructure (856 lines) remains valid as reference/utility code even if not used for the main proof.

## Notes

**Key Mathematical Insight**: The bidirectional reachable fragment avoids the F-persistence problem because:
1. Forward_F and backward_P are proven at the CanonicalMCS level (trivially)
2. The fragment closure properties ensure witnesses stay in the domain
3. The embedding into Int preserves the ordering
4. The pullback transfers F/P properties without needing chain-based persistence

**Literature Reference**: Goldblatt (1992) "Logics of Time and Computation" Chapter 4 uses a similar approach: work at the canonical frame level, then embed into the desired time structure.
