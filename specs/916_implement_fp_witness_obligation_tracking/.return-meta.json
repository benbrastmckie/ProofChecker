  "review_reason": "Omega-squared construction (plan v012 Phase 3) has a mathematical gap: F-formula persistence through Lindenbaum extensions is not provable at any level of chain nesting, including within the omega-squared inner chain. The FPreservingSeed alternative is provably inconsistent when combined with witness formulas (counterexample: psi=G(neg(p)), neg(psi)=F(p)). This blocks ALL bottom-up chain constructions across 12 plan versions and 16 research reports. The viable path is a top-down canonical model approach (worlds=MCSes, relation=GContent-inclusion, forward_F from step lemma, linearity from temp_a axiom).",
