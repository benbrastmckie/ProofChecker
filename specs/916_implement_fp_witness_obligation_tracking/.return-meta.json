Confirmed FIX tag: operators are reflexive not strict. Analyzed IDEA tag: G/neg(G) reframing valid but same obstacle. F-preserving seed conjecture remains open at 55% confidence.",

No additional constraints resolve the forward_F/backward_P obstruction. The F-preserving seed conjecture's proof obstacle is specifically that G-lifting cannot handle neg(G(theta)) formulas in the seed -- a semantic argument (model construction) may succeed where the syntactic approach fails."
