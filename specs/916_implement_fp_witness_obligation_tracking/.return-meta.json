  "summary": "Implementation progress review: WitnessGraph.lean has 5 remaining sorries in Phase 3 across 4 theorems. Phases 1-2 fully complete (sorry-free). Build succeeds. Sorries are bookkeeping/structural, not fundamental obstacles. Recommended approach: prove GContent/HContent propagation first via strong induction, then refactor F/P local witness proofs to avoid isWitnessed case-split. Total remaining effort estimated at 43-56 hours across Phases 3-6, with potential simplification of Phases 4-6 to 15-25 hours.",
