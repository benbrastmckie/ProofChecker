  "summary": "Identified all 4 sorries in DovetailingChain.lean with precise goal states. Sorries 1-2 (cross-sign forward_G/backward_H) are caused by the split forward/backward half-chain architecture that shares only M_0 and cannot propagate G/H content across the sign boundary. Sorries 3-4 (forward_F/backward_P) require F/P witness scheduling because Lindenbaum can add F/P formulas without placing witnesses. The fix requires a unified interleaved chain construction (using the existing dovetailIndex/dovetailRank bijection) with Cantor-pairing enumeration of (time, formula) obligation pairs. Key consistency lemmas (temporal_witness_seed_consistent, past_temporal_witness_seed_consistent) are already proven.",
