The two notions differ in quantification domain - FMP-internal uses finite MCS-derived structures while general validity quantifies over all TaskModels. The validity bridge is blocked for modal operators due to S5-style universal history quantification. Phase 1's FMPSemanticConsequence approach is correctly designed and can be implemented sorry-free.",
