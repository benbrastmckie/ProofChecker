(3) Added helper lemmas: find?_getElem_of_findIdx?, getFormulas_eq_findIdx?_entry, addFormula_nextFamilyIdx. (4) Fixed atom and bot cases using getFormulas_eq_of_wellformed_and_at_position. (5) Added 3 well-formedness lemma stubs: addFormula_preserves_wellFormed, createNewFamily_preserves_wellFormed, createNewTime_preserves_wellFormed (marked sorry for future session). RecursiveSeed.lean: 10 sorries (unchanged count, but 3 atom/bot fixed + 3 new well-formedness stubs).",

Complete 7 operator sorries in buildSeedAux_preserves_seedConsistent: Box/G/H (3), neg-Box/neg-G/neg-H (3), generic imp (1). Each requires showing seed transformations preserve consistency and well-formedness, and IH hypotheses are satisfied."
