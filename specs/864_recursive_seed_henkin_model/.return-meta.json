  "summary": "Researched recursive seed construction for Henkin model completeness. The approach builds a finite seed from the recursive structure of a consistent formula, where negated Box operators create new families and negated temporal operators (G/H) create new time indices. The seed is then completed to a full model via Lindenbaum. Key finding: the temporal-modal interaction problem (BoxContent vs GContent preservation) from task 843 persists during Lindenbaum extension, but the seed approach provides a better starting point by building both layers simultaneously. Existing infrastructure (temporal_witness_seed_consistent, eval_saturated_bundle_exists, constructCoherentWitness) is reusable. Estimated 30-44 hours for full implementation.",
