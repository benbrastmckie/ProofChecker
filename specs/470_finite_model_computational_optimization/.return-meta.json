Core optimizations achieved: migrated Formula.subformulas, filled 5 closure lemmas, completed time arithmetic, added computable definitions (DecidableEq, removed noncomputable). 3 sorries documented with detailed explanations (compositionality, truth bridge, main completeness) - these are known limitations of finite model approach, not blocking issues.",
