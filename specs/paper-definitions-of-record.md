# Paper Definitions of Record

This file is the pinned, verbatim record of the semantic definitions that this repository
depends on from the JPL paper (`/home/benjamin/Philosophy/Papers/PossibleWorlds/JPL/possible_worlds.tex`).
The paper is **read-only input** to this repository: it is never edited from here, and this file
never restates, re-derives, or "improves" any definition it records — it only quotes what the
paper currently says and detects when that text moves.

**Specs and task descriptions in this repository should cite this file, not the paper directly.**
Citing the paper by bare line number has repeatedly gone stale (the paper moved through five
definitional waves between 2026-08-08 and 2026-08-10, and a sixth wave landed on disk, uncommitted,
while this very file was being authored — see "Recording provenance" below). Anchors here are
resolved by `\label{}` name or `\aitem{}` key, never by line number, and `scripts/check-paper-definitions.sh`
re-derives every hash below directly from the live paper file on every run.

### Language correspondence (2026-09-08): permanent, prose only, no re-pin

The repository renamed its object languages so that its names mean what the paper's mean. This
section records the resulting correspondence as a **permanent** fact about the two documents, not
as a pending alignment to be resolved later.

**The manuscript has exactly two languages.** They are 𝓛 and 𝓛⋆, where 𝓛⋆ bundles the stability
modal ⊡ with **both** register families — time store/recall and world store/recall. The
line-independent anchor for that is the sentence defining `\BL^\star` in `\S sub:Extension`;
`sub:` is a sectioning prefix, which C15's citation pattern does not match, so it needs no
`KNOWN-ANCHORS` row. `def:BLstar-semantics` interprets ⊡, `timeStore` and `timeRecall`, and
suppresses the world registers.

**`def:BLplus-language` and `def:TMplus` keep their anchor labels.** Their *labels* still read
`BLplus`/`TMplus` for historical reasons, but their *content* has defined 𝓛 and TM since the
paper collapsed `BL^+` into `BL`. After this rename they correspond to this repository's **L**
and **TM** on the nose — the repository's earlier `L⁺`/`TM⁺` names for them are gone. No text
moved on either side, so neither anchor's hash changes.

**The correspondence, stated permanently:**

| Repository | Manuscript |
|---|---|
| **L**, **TM** (with TM_z, TM_d, TM_r) | 𝓛 (`def:BLplus-language`), TM (`def:TMplus`, `cor:tm-completeness`) — the same systems under the same names |
| **L⁻**, **TM⁻** | **no counterpart.** The H/G fragment was withdrawn from the paper; the passage that named a Past/Future system is commented out in the live source. L⁻ is this repository's own language, and its `z`/`d`/`r` subscripts are Lean-only labels |
| **L⁺**, **TM⁺** | L⁺ is the **⊡-only fragment** of the manuscript's 𝓛⋆. The manuscript supplies no logic for 𝓛⋆ (it places one outside its scope), so TM⁺ answers to no paper system |
| **L⋆** | the **time-register fragment** of the manuscript's 𝓛⋆ — ⊡ plus `timeStore`/`timeRecall`, which is what `app:deterministic-future` uses. The world registers are not formalized |

Every docstring and README that relates a repository language to the paper must say this in those
words. In particular, a repository result about L⁺ or L⋆ is a result about a **fragment of 𝓛⋆**,
and must never be described by a paper name it does not have. The one paper name that now
transfers without qualification is TM, and it transfers because the two are the same system.

**No pin moved.** Per "How to extend this record", this is a prose-and-classification change: no
anchor was added, no anchor drifted as a result of it, and therefore **no `verbatim:` block, no
`sha256:` line, no manifest row, and neither the `PINNED_COMMIT` nor the `FILE_CHECKSUM` sentinel
was touched**. This follows the precedent of "Vocabulary alignment (2026-09-07): prose only, no
re-pin" above.

`scripts/check-paper-definitions.sh` was re-run after the edit. Its verdict is unchanged by this
work: **case (b)**, drift detected, with the same six anchors the separate re-pin work already
owns — `def:S5`, `def:BX`, `def:BX-z`, `def:BX-d`, `def:BX-r`, `def:TMplus` — every one of them a
`smallest extension of X closed under Y` → `extends X to include Y` rewording plus, for `def:BX`
and `def:BX-r`, footnote/comment churn. No anchor entered or left that set because of this rename.

**Citation sites that moved.** The `app:ObjectiveModality` row of "Anchor classification
(2026-09-07)" above names `FormalSystem/BaseLanguage/Axioms.lean` as its citing file; that module
is now `FormalSystem/MinusLanguage/Axioms.lean`. The anchor, its classification and its reason are
unchanged.

### Drift correction and rename absorption (2026-09-07): the z/d/r wave

The paper's z/d/r wave is the largest single wave this record has absorbed: **15 pinned entries
drifted, 9 pinned anchors went dangling, and 3 renamed anchors were newly pinned**, all in one
correction. The checker was red (exit 1) before it and gives the quiet case-(a) pass after it.

**What the paper did.** Three structural moves, each with record-side consequences:

1. **`BL^+` collapsed into `BL`.** The paper stopped maintaining a separate since/until language:
   `def:BLplus-language` now defines `BL` itself and absorbs the eight defined operators that
   `def:BLplus-defined` used to carry; `def:BL-semantics` absorbs the `\since`/`\until` truth
   clauses that `def:BLplus-semantics` used to carry (and drops the `\Past`/`\Future` clauses,
   which are now defined rather than primitive); and the `TM`$^+$ family lost its superscript
   throughout — `def:TMplus` now names **TM**, for **BL**, with extensions **TM**$_z$ / **TM**$_d$
   / **TM**$_r$. The anchor id `def:TMplus` is unchanged; only its content moved.
2. **The `f`/`d`/`c` subscripts became `z`/`d`/`r`, under new labels.** `def:TMplus-f` →
   `def:BX-z`, `def:TMplus-d` → `def:BX-d`, `def:TMplus-c` → `def:BX-r`. These are renames with
   content changes, not pure re-labellings: all three now cite `\S`Extensions for their axioms
   instead of displaying them, `def:BX-z` defers the Hölder step and cites `prop:archimedean`,
   and `def:BX-r` is re-titled *Dense and Complete* and presented as an extension of **BX**$_d$.
3. **The correspondence theorems moved from frames to temporal orders.** `app:discrete`,
   `app:dense`, `app:complete` are now stated as `$\vDash_{\D}$ … iff `$\D$` is …` over a
   temporal order rather than `$\F \vDash$ … iff `$\F$` is a … task frame`, and
   `def:frame-properties` defines Discrete/Dense/Complete on the temporal order first, deriving
   the frame-level predicates from it. `app:discrete` also gained a long footnote explaining why
   these cannot be sharpened to single task frames (the static frame is the counterexample) and
   citing this repository for the fibre-level formulation.

**Retired (manifest row removed, prose entry retained and marked `DANGLING`, `KNOWN-ANCHORS` row
added):** `def:directed` (folded inline into `def:frame`'s opening clause), `def:BLplus-semantics`
and `def:BLplus-defined` (absorbed as above), `thm:BLplus-PastFuture` and
`thm:BLplus-NextPrevious` (removed with the `BL^+` cluster), `TMP-CO` (the `BL^+` restatement of
`CO`; the plain `CO` anchor is still live and still pinned), and `def:TMplus-f` / `def:TMplus-d` /
`def:TMplus-c` (renamed as above).

**Newly pinned:** `def:BX-z` (`385f73e8…`), `def:BX-d` (`555db844…`), `def:BX-r` (`b35751c7…`).

**Re-hashed:** `def:frame`, `def:world-history`, `thm:extension`, `cor:occurrence`,
`def:BL-semantics`, `def:BLplus-language`, `def:S5`, `def:BX`, `def:TMplus`, `app:discrete`,
`app:dense`, `app:complete`, `def:frame-properties`, `cor:saturation-finite`,
`cor:tm-completeness`. Two of these are not mere re-quotes and carry their own notes at their
entries: `cor:saturation-finite` changed **environment** (`Cthm` → `Lthm`) with its statement
word-for-word unchanged, and `def:frame` both absorbed `def:directed` and **softened its
ball-space footnote from "strictly stronger" to "at least as strong as"**, withdrawing the
strictness claim.

`cor:tm-completeness`'s list now reads: **TM** strongly complete over all task frames,
**TM**$_d$ strongly complete over the dense task frames, **TM**$_z$ weakly complete over
ℤ-time, **TM**$_r$ weakly complete over ℝ-time (previously "the dense-and-complete class").

**Four corrections recorded so the next reader does not re-derive them:**

- **The Z1 / Past–Future-fragment footnote is commented out, not live.** The paper's Logic
  subsection carries the fragment claim and its footnote entirely behind `%` (paper lines
  ~1332–1340), with an author note giving the reason: "footnote commented out until the
  BimodalLogic repository establishes that the Past/Future language admits no complete
  axiomatization; the repository currently shows only that one particular system in that language
  is incomplete over ℤ-time." Nothing here is pinned as live, and no `KNOWN-ANCHORS` row is added
  for it. This repository's `not_bl_derivable_z1`
  (`FormalSystem/Metalogic/Conservativity/Z1Countermodel.lean`) is what the commented-out footnote
  *would* cite; the accompanying Kripke countermodel for the base class is a pen-and-paper claim
  this repository does **not** check.
- **`thm:TM-soundness` needed no re-hash.** It is not in the drifted list above, and that is
  correct rather than an omission: everything the paper changed about it — the extension to
  **TM** and its extensions, the new sentence that the since/until/next/previous schemata are
  valid by their clauses as verified in this repository, and the footnote's re-aimed citation —
  lives in the `\begin{proof}` block *after* `\end{Tthm}`, which `resolve_env` does not capture.
  A future task that wants that text pinned must pin the proof block, which the current resolver
  cannot do.
- **`def:BX-r`'s second Reynolds axiom is `SEP`, not `SP`.** The displayed key is `Sep` and the
  `\aitem` label is `SEP`.
- **`prop:fragment` and `rmk:fragment` are gone and require no action.** An exhaustive grep of the
  live paper finds no such labels, no manifest row pinned either, and no file in live tree scope
  cites either name. No `DANGLING` row is added: the record's rule is that a row is a decision,
  and there is no citation to make honest.

**No repository-side consequence:** `lem:temporal-duality` (paper line 4061) and `thm:TD-valid`
(line 4133) were restated for the since/until interchange with new inductive `U`/`S` cases, but
neither has a manifest row and neither is cited anywhere in live tree scope, so this wave leaves
them alone. `prop:archimedean` (line 3265) is a live `Pthm` that `def:BX-z` now cites for the
failure of `UZ`/`Z1` over non-Archimedean discrete orders; it is a pen-and-paper result this
repository does not check, and it is recorded as `LIVE-UNPINNED` (not pinned as verified) if and
when tree prose cites it.

**Moving target during absorption.** The paper file changed on disk *four times while this
correction was being written*: `f3acc3ad…` → `c3846c1e…` between the re-hash and the first
sentinel re-pin, then `c485a615…`, then `1b3c33a2…`. The first three were case (b) — no recorded
definition drifted — but the fourth genuinely drifted `def:BX-z`: the author deleted the two
`%% NEW CHANGE […]` editorial comment lines and the three commented-out sentences from inside the
`Ddef` environment, leaving the live prose word-for-word identical. Because `resolve_env` hashes
the whole environment, comment-only deletions are hash-visible; `def:BX-z` was therefore
re-quoted and re-hashed (`385f73e8…` → `3e2af812…`) and the sentinels re-pinned a second time.
Every anchor was re-derived against the then-current file before each pin, and the checker was
re-run afterwards. Hashes were derived only via `check-paper-definitions.sh --resolve`; none was
hand-written. A reader should expect this file's pin to be behind the live paper again by the
time they read it — that is the condition this infrastructure exists to detect, not a defect in
the pin.

### Anchor classification (2026-09-07): four `LIVE-UNPINNED` rows for the C15 gate

`scripts/check-module-invariants.sh`'s **C15** was the sole failing check group, reporting four
paper-anchor citations resolving to nothing here. All four were re-measured against the live
`.tex` and against the paper repository's `HEAD`, and all four resolve to live, non-commented
`\label{}` targets in both — so all four are recorded `LIVE-UNPINNED`, none `DANGLING`, and no
citation site needed correcting:

| Anchor | Paper environment | Cited by | Why unpinned |
|---|---|---|---|
| `app:ObjectiveModality` | `\subsection{Objective Modality}%` with the label on the following line | `FormalSystem/BaseLanguage/Axioms.lean` | **Structurally unpinnable.** `resolve_env` reads the environment name off the same line as the `\label{}`, so a sectioning label on its own line can never resolve. Same shape as the already-recorded `app:TaskSemantics`. |
| `app:drift` | `Tthm` | `Independence/DriftFrame.lean`, `Independence/RealTranslationFrame.lean` | Pinnable in principle, useless in practice: the `Tthm` block carries only the statement, while the text `DriftFrame.lean` actually engages with — the `λ ≔ (v − w)/(x + y)` interpolation and the compactness/finite-intersection *Saturation* argument — sits in the `\begin{proof}` block *after* `\end{Tthm}`, which `resolve_env` does not capture. A pin would hash text the tree never quotes. |
| `cor:no-characterization` | `Cthm` | `Independence/README.md`, `Independence/DriftFrame.lean`, `Independence/StateSetTruth.lean`, `Independence/RealTranslationFrame.lean` | Cited by name only. |
| `lem:deterministic-singleton` | `Lthm` | `Independence/RealTranslationFrame.lean`, `Independence/StateSetTruth.lean` | Cited by name only; `StateSetTruth.lean` names its choice-free (⇒) direction but quotes no text. |

`app:ObjectiveModality` entered the cited set with the `Axioms.lean` paper-name correspondence
table; the other three entered with the `Metalogic/Independence/` frames. No manifest row, no
`FILE_CHECKSUM` sentinel, and no `PINNED_COMMIT` sentinel is touched by this wave — nothing
drifted, so there is nothing to re-pin.

### Rename absorption (2026-09-02): `Spherical` → `Saturation`

The paper renamed its fourth task-frame axiom from *Spherical* to *Saturation*, moving both
anchors that named it. Two MANIFEST rows were re-keyed to follow:

| Old anchor | New anchor | New checksum |
|---|---|---|
| `def:frame#Spherical` | `def:frame#Saturation` | `c293e9f830a2e1f0154d1ee7be2c7a121a7aa0ec4476266637e4fffaff345c60` |
| `cor:spherical-finite` | `cor:saturation-finite` | `6456eb11cb2adf8b06c929c3f6b5d19dc581f9ba7a33af8a28e61ec675567d74` |

Both checksums were resolved against the live paper via `check-paper-definitions.sh --resolve`
before the rows were written, and independently a second time during implementation; the two
derivations agree. The repository's 441 corresponding occurrences were renamed in the same wave.

**This is a rename absorption, not a drift correction, and the distinction is load-bearing here.**
The anchors did not merely change text — their *keys* moved, which is why they showed up as
`could not be resolved` rather than as drift. Re-keying the rows takes
`check-paper-definitions.sh` from **2 unresolvable to 0**. It does *not* touch the 10 drifted
anchors (`def:task-relation`, `def:directed`, `def:frame`, `def:frame#Compositionality`,
`def:frame#Seriality`, `def:frame#Limit`, `def:world-history`, `thm:extension`,
`def:BLplus-defined`, `def:time-shift-histories`), whose drifted set is byte-identical before and
after this absorption. At least two of those are substantive rather than cosmetic
(`def:time-shift-histories` dropped its explicit translation function; `def:BLplus-defined`
changed item emphasis) and warrant a paper-reconciliation pass of their own.

Per the dirty-pin convention above, the whole-file checksum sentinels are **not** re-pinned: no
drift correction was absorbed here, only a key migration.

**Deliberately left alone.** The prose of this file is a historical record of what the paper said
at the time, so rewriting it would falsify the record. The drift table at
`def:frame#Spherical`, the footnote quoted under `thm:extension`, the resolved-text block under
`cor:spherical-finite`, and the earlier coverage-extension narratives all keep the old name and
should. One item is a judgment call rather than quoted text: the entry heading ``def:directed``
— directed family (used by Spherical)`` is this record's own navigation, not paper text, and
still says *Spherical*. It was left unchanged because it falls outside this absorption's declared
scope, and is flagged here so a later pass can decide it deliberately.

### Drift correction (2026-09-02): ten-anchor re-pin

The ten anchors the rename absorption above left drifted are re-quoted and re-hashed here, and the
sentinels are re-pinned, because a drift *correction* is now being absorbed (the dirty-pin
convention). Before this correction `check-paper-definitions.sh` reported **10 drifted, 0
unresolvable**; after it, the quiet case-(a) pass. Paper file sha256 `7303bc9e…`, 4867 lines,
paper repo `git HEAD` `fa0dbf7c053e6ecd22e9815180dd91beb2604e61` with the file dirty against it
(`M JPL/possible_worlds.tex`) — the dirty-pin caveat below applies unchanged, so the checksum is
the authoritative pin and the SHA is provenance only.

Classification, anchor by anchor:

| Anchor | Change | Class |
|---|---|---|
| `def:time-shift-histories` | The explicit translation function `\bar{a}(z) = z + d` with `y = \bar{a}(x)` is gone; the relation is now stated pointwise as `\tau(z) = \sigma(z + y - x)` for all `z \in D`. | **Substantive** (same relation, since `d = y - x` is forced; but the definiens changed shape) |
| `def:world-history` | Last sentence: "The set of all total world histories over $\F$ is denoted $H_{\F}$" → "The set of all possible worlds over $\F$ is denoted $H_{\F}$". | Terminological — equivalent by the definition's own "total--- equivalently, a possible world" |
| `def:frame` | `\item[\bf …]` → `\item[\it …]` on all four axioms; the fourth axiom's name *Spherical* → *Saturation* (the rename already absorbed at the key level above); the footnote moved `~\cite{Cmiel2021}` from the second sentence to the first and renamed *Spherical* → *Saturation* in its text. | Cosmetic + rename; no mathematical change |
| `def:frame#Compositionality`, `def:frame#Seriality`, `def:frame#Limit` | `\bf` → `\it` item emphasis only. | Cosmetic |
| `thm:extension` | Footnote wording only: *Spherical* → *Saturation* twice, and the cross-reference `cor:spherical-finite` → `cor:saturation-finite`. Statement unchanged. | Rename follow-through; cosmetic |
| `def:task-relation` | `\bf` → `\it` on the Fiber/Cone/Segment items (reversing the 2026-08-25 `\it` → `\bf` change). | Cosmetic |
| `def:directed` | `\item[\bf $\mathbf{\supseteq}$-Directed:]` → `\item[\it $\supseteq$-Directed:]` (and the `\subseteq` twin). | Cosmetic |
| `def:BLplus-defined` | `\bf` → `\it` on all eight defined-operator items. | Cosmetic |

**The repository's Lean statements are unaffected.** Every change above is equivalent to the
pinned text it replaces: `WorldHistory.timeShift` was already the pointwise `σ(z + Δ)` reading
of `def:time-shift-histories`, `H_F` (`TaskFrame.HF`) already denotes exactly the total
histories, and the emphasis/rename changes carry no content. The two in-tree verbatim quotations
that this correction does move — the `def:world-history` closing sentence, quoted in
`FormalSystem/Semantics/WorldHistory.lean`, `PartialHistory.lean`, and
`FormalSystem/Metalogic/Algebraic/FlowFrame.lean` — are updated to the live wording in the same
change set.

**Two navigation headings updated.** ``def:directed — directed family (used by Spherical)`` now
reads *(used by Saturation)*, resolving the judgment call the rename absorption above flagged;
and ``def:time-shift-histories — …, translation form`` now reads *…, pointwise form*, following
the substantive change. Both headings are this record's own navigation, not quoted paper text, so
updating them does not falsify the record. For the same reason the `def:frame` sub-anchor table's
fourth row is re-keyed from `def:frame#Spherical` to `def:frame#Saturation` with the live text
and hash the rename absorption already placed in the manifest — the table is the record's
per-axiom index of the *current* pins, and it now agrees with the manifest again.

**Deliberately left alone.** Every earlier narrative section keeps its historical wording
(*Spherical*, "translation form", the 2026-08-25 note that `def:task-relation`'s items went
`\it` → `\bf`) — those describe what the paper said at the time. `app:auto_existence` and
`lem:history-time-shift-preservation` remain `LIVE-UNPINNED`: the Lean docstrings that cite them
do so by name only and quote no text.

### Drift correction and coverage extension (2026-08-17): the target-state-revision re-pin

Absorbed as one re-pin during the reference-manual target-state revision:

- **22 drifted anchors re-quoted and re-hashed**: `thm:s4`, `thm:sym` (macro rename
  `\mathrm{Str}` → `\Str`; `thm:sym` also gained a Williamson/Bacon–Zeng footnote),
  `def:task-relation`, `thm:extension`, `def:constraints`, `lem:nesting`, `def:BL-semantics`,
  `def:BLplus-semantics`, `def:frame-validity`, `def:logical-consequence`, `def:BX`,
  `def:TMplus-f`, `def:TMplus-c`, `def:TMplus`, `app:discrete`, `app:dense`, `app:complete`,
  `cor:tm-completeness`, `def:id`, `def:strongest`, `thm:exist`, `lem:uniq`.
- **2 dangling anchors retired from the manifest** (entries retained, marked DANGLING above):
  `def:BL-model`, `cor:tm-decidability`.
- **3 anchors added** (newly load-bearing for the manual's target-state revision):
  `thm:BLplus-PastFuture`, `thm:BLplus-NextPrevious`, `def:time-shift-histories`.
- Sentinels re-pinned: checksum `9fa1c5fc829ecab11fbf5685be622fc90bf4f9198119db48f35ad8a81ce0a2bf`,
  paper repo `git HEAD` `831c599d3f76fc9ebb7fb297ef80442c4624a035` (file dirty against it, per
  the dirty-pin caveat below), 4228 lines, 2026-08-17T17:31Z. Post-edit verification run
  reported all 50 recorded definitions unchanged — pass.

### Drift correction (2026-08-17, second wave): lem:fibers retired

A later editing wave the same day removed `\label{lem:fibers}` from the live paper; every other
recorded anchor verified unchanged. The `lem:fibers` entry is retained above, marked DANGLING and
removed from the manifest. Sentinels re-pinned: checksum
`f134fd7d460c08aaf94c5b1c09571ab2663c509d1ee32f2d31b89ee640281381`, paper repo `git HEAD`
`d1a26f75bcd3e0623d1593263471c5fc63126894` (dirty-pin caveat applies), 4213 lines.

### Drift correction (2026-08-25), part 1: dangling anchors and substantive drift

The paper moved again (4213 -> 4856 lines). `check-paper-definitions.sh` reported **32 drifted
anchors and 6 unresolvable anchors** before this correction. Part 1 resolves every unresolvable
anchor and re-quotes the anchors whose *mathematics or claim* actually changed; part 2 (below)
absorbs the residual terminological and cosmetic drift and re-pins the sentinels.

**6 unresolvable anchors, resolved (4) or retired (2):**

| Anchor | Cause | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| `def:frame#Compositionality` | paper re-spelled `\item[\it X:]` as `\item[\bf X:]` | resolver made markup-agnostic; re-quoted, re-hashed |
| `def:frame#Seriality` | same | same |
| `def:frame#Limit` | same | same |
| `def:frame#Spherical` | same, plus a genuine change (see below) | same |
| `thm:s4` | label removed from the paper | retired DANGLING; succeeded by `thm:s5` |
| `thm:sym` | label removed from the paper | retired DANGLING; succeeded by `thm:s5` |

The four `def:frame#*` anchors did **not** go dangling because the paper dropped an axiom — all
four axioms are still there. They went dangling because `resolve_text`'s `item` case searched for
the literal `\item[\it NAME:]` and the paper re-spelled the emphasis command. That brittleness is
now fixed in the script itself rather than by re-keying the manifest on `\bf` (which would fail
again on the next markup wave); see "Hashing method" above.

`thm:s4` and `thm:sym` were merged by the paper into a single `thm:s5` (live line 2158), which
states S4, B, **and** T as three conjuncts of one theorem. `thm:s5` is added to the manifest here.

**7 substantive anchors re-quoted and re-hashed** (what changed, and whether it reaches Lean):

| Anchor | What changed | Lean impact |
|---|---|---|
| `def:directed` | split into two clauses, `$\supseteq$-Directed` and `$\subseteq$-Directed`; the old bare "directed" is now the `$\supseteq$` half | **Yes.** Every in-tree quotation of "directed family" is now under-qualified and must read `⊇`-directed. `Spherical` consumes the `⊇` half. |
| `def:frame` | `frame` -> `task frame`; `Spherical` now reads "$\supseteq$-directed family"; a new footnote places Spherical as $\mathbf{S}_1^d$ in the Ćmiel-Kuhlmann-Kuhlmann ball-space hierarchy, **strictly stronger** than "spherically complete" ($\mathbf{S}_1$) | **Yes.** `TaskFrame.lean`'s `Spherical` docstring must carry the `⊇` qualifier and the $\mathbf{S}_1^d$ characterization. Still four axioms; nullity is still not one. |
| `def:frame-properties` | the `Deterministic` clause was **removed**; only Discrete/Dense/Complete remain. Deterministic is now standalone `def:deterministic` (live line 2868) | **Yes.** Any citation of `def:frame-properties` for determinism must repoint to `def:deterministic`. |
| `cor:tm-completeness` | restructured; now states four systems explicitly (TM$^+$ strongly complete over **all** task frames; TM$^+_\textsc{d}$ strongly complete over the dense; TM$^+_\textsc{f}$ weakly complete over $\Z$-time; TM$^+_\textsc{c}$ **weakly** complete over the dense-and-complete class), and adds a footnote attributing these results *and the corresponding soundness results* to this Lean repository | **Yes — one live item.** (i) **Live.** TM$^+_\textsc{c}$ is now weak completeness over the dense-and-complete class, which is what `FrameClass.Dedekind` is — the in-tree "completeness *simpliciter*" / "no `FrameClass` member picks it out" passages are stale. (ii) **Resolved 2026-09-01.** The new footnote attributes strong completeness for TM$^+$ / TM$^+_\textsc{d}$ to this repository. That attribution was, when this row was written, conditional on the then-unproved `CompactBase` / `CompactDense`. Both are now proved — `compactBase` and `compactDense` in `FormalSystem/Metalogic/Compactness.lean`, by an ultraproduct model-existence construction — and the strong-completeness results themselves are inhabited unconditionally by `strongCompletenessBase` and `strongCompletenessDense` in that module, sorry-free at exactly `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`. The paper's attribution is accurate as it stands; no paper-side correction is needed for (ii). |
| `def:strongest` | "strongest objective **normal** modal operator" -> "strongest objective modal operator"; "iff" -> "if and only if"; the normality-redundancy comment removed | No Lean counterpart in the tree (objective-modality appendix is unformalized). |
| `thm:exist` | same "normal" drop | As above. |
| `def:id` | substantially expanded: propositional *variables* rather than sentence letters, an explicit $\chi_{(\psi/\varphi)}$ substitution convention, and a long free-for/operator-scope footnote making $\equiv$ a congruence for the logical vocabulary but not for operator terms | No Lean counterpart (identity extension is unformalized). |
| `thm:extension` | footnote restructured; it **no longer says** the Zorn appeal is "and hence to the axiom of choice", now saying the derivation of *Occurrence* is "a theorem of ZFC" and contrasting it with the choice-free `lem:nullity` and `cor:spherical-finite` | **Yes.** Three in-tree sites quote the retired "and hence to the axiom of choice" wording verbatim. |

(That is eight rows for "7 substantive anchors": `def:strongest` and `thm:exist` carry one and the
same change — the `normal` drop — and the plan counted them as one item. The row count, not the
item count, is what the manifest tracks.)

### Drift correction (2026-08-25), part 2: terminological drift, `def:deterministic`, re-pin

Part 2 absorbs the residual drift left by part 1 and re-pins the sentinels. After part 1 the
checker reported **24 drifted anchors and 0 unresolvable anchors**; all 24 are re-quoted and
re-hashed here, and the checker now returns the quiet case-(a) pass.

**The global `frame` -> `task frame` rename** accounts for most of it. The paper renamed its
central object, so 17 anchors changed by exactly that substitution and nothing else:
`lem:nullity`, `def:world-history`, `cor:occurrence`, `lem:nesting`, `lem:nonempty`,
`lem:admissible`, `lem:step`, `def:BL-semantics`, `def:time-shift-histories`,
`def:frame-validity`, `app:discrete`, `app:dense`, `app:complete`, `cor:spherical-finite`,
`thm:BLplus-NextPrevious`, `def:constraints`, `lem:constraint`. This is terminological, not
mathematical — but it is **not** cosmetic for this repository, because the tree quotes several of
these blocks verbatim in docstrings. Those quotations are corrected against this record.

**Three of the 24 carry a second, non-terminological change** and must not be filed as pure
rename:

| Anchor | Second change | Lean impact |
|---|---|---|
| `lem:constraint` | "form a directed family" -> "form a **$\supseteq$-directed** family", following `def:directed`'s split in part 1 | **Yes.** Every in-tree "directed family" quotation is under-qualified. |
| `def:constraints` | the $\F = \tuple{W, \D, \Rightarrow}$ expansion contracted to a bare $\F$ | No. |
| `thm:BLplus-NextPrevious` | the statement was **split into three sentences**: the `\Next` biconditional, then the no-successor `\leftrightarrow \bot` case as a separate "Additionally" clause, then the past dual. Same content, restructured. | No. |

**Seven anchors changed cosmetically only** — `\vspace` retuning (`def:task-relation`,
`def:BL-semantics`, `def:BLplus-semantics`, `def:S5`), `\item[\it ...]` -> `\item[\bf ...]`
(`def:task-relation`'s Fiber/Cone/Segment items), a `\mathrm{Th}` -> `\Th` macro swap inside an
already-commented-out block (`def:TMplus-c`), prose rewording that changes no claim (`def:BX`'s
"swapping occurrences" -> "interchanging all occurrences", `def:TMplus-f`'s Hölder sentence), and
`def:TMplus`'s deletion of a large commented-out conservativity footnote plus its `% TODO`.

**One anchor added**: `def:deterministic` (live line 2868). The paper removed `Deterministic` from
`def:frame-properties` and gave it its own definition. It is load-bearing —
`FormalSystem/Examples/TemporalStructures.lean` cites it — so it is pinned here rather than left
untracked.

**Twelve new appendix anchors deliberately NOT pinned** (decision recorded, not an oversight).
The paper grew a topology / presheaf / Conduché appendix block carrying
`def:task-topology` (2872), `app:topology-t1` (2904), `app:topology-r0` (2923), `app:gluing`
(2976), `def:interval-site` (3208), `def:behavior-presheaf` (3233), `lem:factorization-linear`
(3247), `lem:interval-twisted-arrow` (3278), `app:presheaf-dictionary` (3313), `def:path-category`
(3386), `def:conduche` (3406), `cor:path-fibration` (3510). **None of them is cited anywhere in
this repository and none has a Lean counterpart.** Pinning them would widen this file's
maintenance surface to a region the tree does not depend on, which is exactly what the
"Deliberately not covered" scope boundary below exists to prevent. If any of them becomes
load-bearing, add it then, via
`check-paper-definitions.sh --resolve "ANCHOR|env|-|-"`.

**Sentinels re-pinned**: checksum
`5d700a2f05999bb697ab55e16f5a26732cbf7453dbb7d909d21fb67c70da7644`, paper repo `git HEAD`
`94f850f69f345fd8e4be2516eb3d74f944e66445` (file dirty against it — the dirty-pin caveat below
applies unchanged), 4856 lines (up from 4213). Post-edit verification run returned the quiet
case-(a) pass: `bash scripts/check-paper-definitions.sh` exits 0.

### Dirty-pin caveat (why the pin is a checksum, not a clean commit)

At the moment this file was authored, the paper's working tree was **dirty relative to its own
git HEAD**: `git status --porcelain` reported `M possible_worlds.tex` against base commit
`eb5be99e` (`git diff --stat HEAD` showed 32 insertions / 12 deletions, net +12 lines). This is a
live instance of the exact failure mode this file exists to guard against — a sixth definitional
wave landing while this task was in flight — and it is recorded here rather than papered over.

The dirty edit was independently confirmed, by re-deriving every hash below **both** before and
after the edit landed, to be **entirely confined to the `def:constraints` / `lem:constraint` /
`lem:admissible` proof-machinery neighborhood** (it restructured that proof and split out a new
`lem:fibers` lemma) — a region deliberately **not** in this file's coverage (see "Deliberately
not covered" below). Every anchor tracked in the manifest hashed identically before and after.
This is exactly **case (b)** from `check-paper-definitions.sh`'s three-outcome contract: the paper
changed, but no recorded definition drifted.

Because the working tree was dirty and no clean commit captured the exact content this file
quotes, the **file checksum** above (not the commit SHA) is the authoritative pin. The commit SHA
is recorded as the best-available provenance anchor (the base the dirty edit was made against),
not as a claim that the quoted content is byte-identical to that commit's committed blob — it is
not (see the caveat's own diff above). Anyone citing this record should treat the checksum as
ground truth and the commit SHA as "approximately where in history this sits."

**Still dirty at the 2026-09-07 z/d/r rename-absorption re-pin.** `git status --porcelain`
reported `M JPL/possible_worlds.tex` against `HEAD` = `f61bbd75`, and the last commit actually to
touch the file is `acfa75fd`, an ancestor of neither the pinned content nor of `HEAD`'s tree for
this path. The `PINNED_COMMIT` sentinel therefore again does **not** reproduce `FILE_CHECKSUM`,
and that is expected rather than a defect. Stronger than in the earlier waves: the file changed on
disk *during* the absorption itself (see the moving-target note in the 2026-09-07 narrative
above), so the pin is a snapshot of a file under active edit. Use `--resolve` against the live
file, never `--against <commit>`, when re-deriving anything from this wave.

### Drift correction (2026-08-11, found during independent verification)

The paper's dirty working tree moved **again** while this record was being independently
verified — a live wave, on top of the wave described in the caveat above, occurring in real time
during the verification pass rather than between authoring and verification. Two successive
checksum changes were observed during verification (`efe6fc74...` recording-time →
`645018ae...` mid-verification → `485aa764...`, the final, since-stable state this record is now
re-pinned to). This is exactly the phenomenon this infrastructure exists to catch, and it is
recorded here rather than silently re-pinned without explanation.

Unlike the caveat's original dirty edit (confined to the excluded `def:constraints` neighborhood,
case (b), no tracked anchor affected), **this wave genuinely drifted a tracked anchor**: the paper
renamed `\label{thm:occurrence}` to `\label{cor:occurrence}` and merged its statement with a
separate corollary formerly labelled `app:nonempty` (per the paper's own `%% CHANGE
(occurrence-nonempty-merged)` editorial comment at the site), producing a strictly stronger
statement — the evaluation time `x` is now universally given rather than merely existentially
witnessed. `thm:extension`'s footnote, which cross-references the anchor by name, changed
correspondingly (`\ref{thm:occurrence}` → `\ref{cor:occurrence}`), so both anchors' recorded text
and hash were updated. This is case (c) — genuine drift — correctly caught by
`check-paper-definitions.sh` against the live paper, not a false positive.

**Correction applied**: the `thm:occurrence` entry above is renamed to `cor:occurrence` with its
current verbatim text and freshly-derived hash; `thm:extension`'s entry is re-hashed to match its
updated footnote; the manifest below reflects both changes; the file checksum and line count in
the provenance table above are re-pinned to the post-correction live state. No other tracked
anchor was affected by this wave (confirmed by re-running the full lint after this correction —
see the implementation summary for the verbatim re-run output).

**Known consequence of this correction**: `check-paper-definitions.sh --against eb5be99e...`
(the recorded base commit) will now report `thm:extension`/`cor:occurrence` as drifted/dangling,
because the rename is an uncommitted edit in the paper's working tree that postdates the base
commit — the base commit still has the pre-rename `thm:occurrence` text. This is expected, not a
lint defect: the checksum (re-pinned above), not the base commit, is this record's authoritative
pin, exactly per the dirty-pin caveat's own logic. The no-argument invocation against the live
paper — the check this lint exists to run day to day — passes cleanly (case a) as of this
correction.

### Drift correction (2026-08-12): the three-anchor wave, absorbed as one re-pin

A further live wave drifted **three** tracked anchors at once — `def:BLplus-semantics`,
`thm:extension`, and `def:constraints` — and the gate reported case (c) against all three. All
three are corrected here **together, in a single coherent correction with one whole-file
re-pin**. This is deliberate and is the lesson of the two earlier corrections above: because the
authoritative pin is a **whole-file** checksum, correcting one drifted anchor while leaving the
others uncorrected re-pins the file to a state the record does not fully quote, which is
incoherent — the checksum would then assert "the record matches this file" while two entries
still quoted superseded text. A drift wave is absorbed as a unit or not at all.

What moved, per anchor (each re-quoted verbatim above, each hash re-derived from the live paper
by the same extraction the lint performs, and each re-derivation confirmed against the hash the
lint itself reported for the live text):

- **`def:BLplus-semantics`** (`3f56a996…` → `f40f514e…`): the argument-order footnote was
  **repaired by the paper**, per its own `%% CHANGE (halden-defect-repair,
  untl-snce-convention)` comment at the site. The footnote previously attributed a guard-first
  Pnueli convention to this repository's `snce`/`untl` constructors; it now states the mismatch
  in the direction that actually holds (paper surface notation guard-first, repository
  constructors event-first/Burgess), and adds that the truth conditions agree once the argument
  order is swapped. **The two `($\since$)` / `($\until$)` truth clauses themselves are unchanged
  byte-for-byte** — no semantic claim moved. This resolves, in the paper, the divergence this
  record escalated in `specs/decisions/untl-snce-argument-order.md`; the caveat under that entry
  is rewritten below to describe the repaired footnote rather than the old defective one.
  **Superseded 2026-08-17**: the paper has since removed the footnote outright — the live anchor
  `edde7517…` is footnote-free — and the Lean tree has been migrated to guard-first, so there is
  no longer a convention to describe on either side. The bullet above is retained as the record of
  the 2026-08-12 wave; the caveat under the entry itself has been rewritten again accordingly.
- **`thm:extension`** (`af9b23bf…` → `e63eac74…`): statement unchanged; the footnote's existing
  choice-contrast clause was extended to also name the finite-`W` case discharged choice-free by
  a new corollary (paper comment `%% CHANGE (finite-spherical-corollary)`). See the residual gap
  below.
- **`def:constraints`** (`d763818…` → `3678ab02…`): two changes, both narrowing/wording rather
  than restructuring. The defined term is now "the *constraints on `z`*" (formerly "the
  *constraints imposed on `z`*"), and the segment case gained an explicit "when both `t,s ∈ X`"
  guard on the `t < z < s` condition. The constraint family itself — segments between bracketing
  times, fibers otherwise — is the same family.

**Known residual gap — DISCHARGED (see "Coverage extension (2026-08-17)" below).** The same wave
added three anchors this record did **not** track at all: `cor:spherical-finite` (finite `W`
satisfies *Spherical*, choice-free), `lem:nesting` (imposed fibers and segments nest along the time
order), and `lem:nonempty` (every imposed constraint is nonempty). The gap they left was concrete:
**`thm:extension`'s re-quoted footnote cites `\ref{cor:spherical-finite}`**, so while that anchor
was untracked a tracked entry referenced an untracked one, and a future rename or restatement of
`cor:spherical-finite` would have silently invalidated the cross-reference inside `thm:extension`'s
recorded text without the lint saying anything. All three are now tracked and the gap is closed;
the paragraph is retained rather than deleted so the reasoning that closed it stays legible.

### Coverage extension (2026-08-17): the three constraint-neighborhood anchors

`cor:spherical-finite`, `lem:nesting`, and `lem:nonempty` are now tracked, discharging the residual
gap recorded above. The semantic-FMP-over-ℤ work transcribes `cor:spherical-finite` verbatim as the
source for `TaskFrame.spherical_of_finite`, so leaving its central citation unprotected by the lint
was the immediate motivation; `lem:nesting` and `lem:nonempty` were added with it because they are
the other two members of the same untracked gap and sit in the same `def:constraints` →
`lem:constraint` → `lem:step` chain. `cor:spherical-finite` was resolved and added first, in
isolation, by the finite-frame discharge work; the two constraint lemmas followed. The record moves
from 47 to **49** tracked definitions.

**Lint state at this extension**: the paper has drifted again since the previous coverage
extension, and `scripts/check-paper-definitions.sh` reports **case (c)** — 19 recorded blocks
changed, and two recorded anchors (`def:BL-model`, `cor:tm-decidability`) no longer resolve at all.
That drift is *not* corrected here, and is recorded rather than absorbed: it predates this
extension, it spans anchors this extension does not touch, and re-quoting 19 blocks plus repairing
two dangling anchors is a paper-reconciliation pass in its own right rather than a side effect of
adding three rows. None of the three anchors added here is among the drifted set, and neither are
`def:frame`, `def:frame#Spherical`, `def:directed`, `def:task-relation`, `cor:occurrence`, or
`def:frame-properties`. The whole-file checksum sentinels are therefore **not** re-pinned, per the
dirty-pin convention above: no drift correction was absorbed.

### Coverage extension (2026-08-11): the extension-machinery anchors

The paper-refactor cluster's task descriptions quote the extension machinery (`lem:constraint`,
`lem:step`) directly, and two cluster tasks commit to mirroring the paper's proof decomposition
lemma-for-lemma. Per this file's own extension protocol, those anchors are now **tracked**, not
excluded: `def:constraints`, `lem:constraint`, `lem:fibers`, `lem:admissible`, and `lem:step`
(five entries, added below with hashes derived from the live paper). Note that a paper wave
restructured this neighborhood after the original recording: the admissibility characterization
was **split out** of the old Constraint Lemma into its own `lem:admissible`, warranted by the new
`lem:fibers`, and the lead-in prose was promoted to the numbered `def:constraints`. The current
chain is `def:constraints` → `lem:constraint` (directedness + nonemptiness only) → `lem:fibers`
→ `lem:admissible` → `lem:step` (sole *Spherical* application site) → `thm:extension` (Zorn) →
`cor:occurrence`. The file checksum in the provenance table above is re-pinned to the live state
these hashes were derived from; all 18 previously-recorded anchors were re-verified unchanged at
this re-pin (case (b) — the intervening edits were comment cleanup and proof-prose restructuring
outside every previously-tracked block).

### Coverage extension (2026-08-10): the `BL^+` anchors

`def:BLplus-semantics` was cited by the total-history-validity refactor's plan while being
**untracked** — `grep -c BLplus` over this file returned 0 — so any spec quoting it was ungrounded
and unprotected by the lint. Three anchors are now tracked: `def:BLplus-language` (the `BL^+`
language and its `\since`/`\until` constructors), `def:BLplus-semantics` (the two extra truth
clauses, plus the constructor-argument-order footnote), and `def:BLplus-defined` (the derived
temporal operators). All three resolved cleanly, so none is recorded as a gap. The record moves
from 23 to **26** tracked definitions.

The `def:BLplus-semantics` entry carried an argument-order caveat: at the time of this coverage
extension the paper's footnote described this repository's `snce`/`untl` constructors as
guard-first/event-second, while the Lean tree is event-first/guard-second. That divergence was
quoted here (never silently corrected — this file records what the paper says) and escalated in
`specs/decisions/untl-snce-argument-order.md`. **Superseded 2026-08-12**: the paper has since
repaired the footnote in the direction that actually holds; see "Drift correction (2026-08-12)"
above and the rewritten caveat under the entry itself. **Superseded again 2026-08-17**: the
footnote has since been removed from the paper entirely, and the Lean tree has been migrated to
guard-first, discharging the caveat rather than restating it. The decision record is closed as
DECIDED.

### Vocabulary alignment (2026-09-07): prose only, no re-pin

The repository's own commentary around `def:world-history`, `thm:extension` and `cor:occurrence`
still described the paper's middle tier as a *world history* and its top tier as a *total* world
history. Those are the superseded terms: the pinned text of `def:world-history` above already
layers **partial history** -> **convex history** -> **possible world**, and reserves `H_F` for the
possible worlds. The surrounding headings and commentary have been brought onto that vocabulary.

This was a prose-only correction. Per "How to extend this record", no anchor was added and no
anchor drifted, so **no `verbatim:` block, no `sha256:` line, no manifest row, and neither the
`PINNED_COMMIT` nor the `FILE_CHECKSUM` sentinel was touched**. `scripts/check-paper-definitions.sh`
was re-run after the edit and its drifted-anchor set was unchanged (the six `def:S5`, `def:BX`,
`def:BX-z`, `def:BX-d`, `def:BX-r`, `def:TMplus` anchors owned by the separate re-pin work);
`def:world-history`, `thm:extension` and `cor:occurrence` do not appear in it.

One occurrence of the superseded wording survives below and is deliberate: the drift-log row
under "Drift correction and rename absorption (2026-09-07)" quotes it as archival evidence of what
the paper used to say. The `>`-quoted footnote under "Untracked sources" was found to be quoting
the *superseded* text of a footnote the paper has since revised, and was re-quoted from the live
paper in the same change; see the note recorded there.

## How to read this file

Each entry below has:
- **Anchor**: the `\label{}` name, or (for axioms introduced via the paper's `\aitem` macro) the
  `\aitem` key together with its enclosing section.
- **Verbatim text**: the exact LaTeX source of the defining block, quoted character-for-character
  (including the block's own `%%` editorial-history comments where present — those are literal
  source text and are quoted, not stripped, so the record and the hash always agree).
- **Content hash**: `sha256` of exactly the quoted text (see "Hashing method" below).

Anchors marked **DERIVED** are theorems/lemmas proved from the primitive definitions, not
definitions themselves — recorded here because downstream tasks cite their exact statements as
settled inputs, same as a definition.

### Hashing method (must match `check-paper-definitions.sh` exactly)

- **`env` anchors** (a `\label{X}` on the same line as `\begin{ENV}`, e.g. `\begin{Ddef} \label{def:frame}`):
  the hash covers every line from that `\begin{ENV}` line (inclusive) through the next line
  containing the literal string `\end{ENV}` (inclusive) — i.e. the whole definition/theorem
  environment, including any editorial `%%` comment lines inside it.
- **`item` anchors** (one of `def:frame`'s four axioms, which are `\item[MARKUP NAME:]` entries
  with no `\label` of their own): the enclosing environment is resolved first as above, then the
  hash covers exactly the single line inside that block whose item label is `NAME:`. Resolution is
  **markup-agnostic**: the emphasis command is tried in the order `\it`, `\bf`, `\em`,
  `\itshape`, `\bfseries`, bare, and the first match wins. This is deliberate — the paper
  re-spelled all four `def:frame` items from `\item[\it NAME:]` to `\item[\bf NAME:]` in a
  2026-08 editing wave, and a resolver keyed on one spelling reported four live anchors as
  DANGLING on a purely cosmetic change. The hash still covers the resolved line **verbatim**, so
  the markup change itself is still reported as drift; only the *resolution* is markup-agnostic.
- **`aitem` anchors** (an axiom introduced via the paper's `\newcommand{\aitem}[2][]{...\label{#2}}`
  macro, e.g. `\aitem{CO}` or `\aitem[CO]{TMP-CO}`): the hash covers exactly the single line
  matching `\aitem` (optionally `[KEY]`) `{LABEL}`.

This assumes none of the tracked environments nest another instance of the same environment name
inside itself (true for every entry below, verified at recording time) — the extraction takes the
*first* matching `\end{ENV}` after the label line.

### `def:directed` — directed family (used by Saturation) — **DANGLING as of the 2026-09-07 rename-absorption re-pin (removed from manifest)**

The live paper no longer carries a `\label{def:directed}`. The `⊇`-directed condition was
folded inline into `def:frame`'s opening clause ("Letting a nonempty family of sets
$\mathcal{S}$ be *$\supseteq$-directed* just in case …"), and the `⊆`-directed half was
dropped. The quoted text below is retained as the last-resolved historical record. If the paper
restores the anchor, re-add a manifest row via
`check-paper-definitions.sh --resolve "def:directed|env|-|-"`.

```latex
\begin{Ddef} \label{def:directed}
	A nonempty family of sets $\mathcal{S}$ is:
	\begin{enumerate}[wide=0pt, labelsep=.1in, itemsep=.075in]
		\item[\it $\supseteq$-Directed:] just in case $S \subseteq S_1 \cap S_2$ for some $S \in \mathcal{S}$ whenever $S_1, S_2 \in \mathcal{S}$.
		\item[\it $\subseteq$-Directed:] just in case $S_1, S_2 \subseteq S$ for some $S \in \mathcal{S}$ whenever $S_1, S_2 \in \mathcal{S}$.

### `def:frame` — the frame definition (whole block, all four axioms)

```latex
\begin{Ddef} \label{def:frame}
	Letting a nonempty family of sets $\mathcal{S}$ be \textit{$\supseteq$-directed} just in case $S \subseteq S_1 \cap S_2$ for some $S \in \mathcal{S}$ whenever $S_1, S_2 \in \mathcal{S}$, a \textit{task frame} is any $\F = \tuple{W, \D, \Rightarrow}$ where $W$ is a nonempty set of world states, $\D$ is a temporal order, and $\Rightarrow$ is a task relation satisfying the following for all positive durations $x, y \geq 0$:
	\begin{enumerate}[wide=0pt, labelsep=.1in, itemsep=.075in]
		\item[\it Compositionality:] $w \Rightarrow_{x + y} v$ if and only if $w \Rightarrow_x u$ and $u \Rightarrow_y v$ for some $u \in W$.
		\item[\it Seriality:] $w \Rightarrow_x u$ and $v \Rightarrow_x w$ for some $u, v \in W$.
		\item[\it Limit:] $\bigcap\limits_{x > 0} (w)_x = \set{w}$.
		\item[\it Saturation:] $\bigcap \mathcal{S} \neq \emptyset$ for any $\supseteq$-directed family $\mathcal{S}$ of nonempty fibers and segments.%
    \footnote{
      The nonempty fibers and segments form a \textit{ball space} on $W$ in the sense of \'{C}miel, Kuhlmann, and Kuhlmann~\cite{Cmiel2021}.
      \textit{Saturation} is the downward-directed-intersection condition $\mathbf{S}_1^d$ of the ball-space hierarchy--- the nest condition $\mathbf{S}_1$ with a $\supseteq$-directed system of balls in place of a nest--- and so is at least as strong as the standard \textit{spherically complete} condition, which is $\mathbf{S}_1$ itself.

Four axioms, not more, not fewer — **Nullity is NOT an axiom**, it is `lem:nullity` below, DERIVED
from Seriality and Limit. Each axiom is also tracked individually (sub-anchors of `def:frame`, no
`\label` of their own — resolved as the enclosing block's `\item[MARKUP NAME:]` line, markup-agnostically), so that a
future paper edit which reorders or drops exactly one axiom is named precisely rather than only
flagging "`def:frame` changed":

| Sub-anchor | Verbatim text | sha256 |
|---|---|---|
| `def:frame#Compositionality` | `\item[\it Compositionality:] $w \Rightarrow_{x + y} v$ if and only if $w \Rightarrow_x u$ and $u \Rightarrow_y v$ for some $u \in W$.` | `4b9248498399338eeaccb63c5e8952ca0928b87bb85bcd94f596d9c263bb64fa` |
| `def:frame#Seriality` | `\item[\it Seriality:] $w \Rightarrow_x u$ and $v \Rightarrow_x w$ for some $u, v \in W$.` | `ad1863bf950f17906a79b469b40fddb102e4abf5bd1bfd828a2f4b4900c7dbad` |
| `def:frame#Limit` | `\item[\it Limit:] $\bigcap\limits_{x > 0} (w)_x = \set{w}$.` | `3eedd389d6cbdf5dff50f82ad9bafed30fe5eff5ec923cfdc165ca75dbe60a5f` |
| `def:frame#Saturation` | `\item[\it Saturation:] $\bigcap \mathcal{S} \neq \emptyset$ for any $\supseteq$-directed family $\mathcal{S}$ of nonempty fibers and segments.%` | `c293e9f830a2e1f0154d1ee7be2c7a121a7aa0ec4476266637e4fffaff345c60` |

Note: **Compositionality is a biconditional**, not a one-directional implication — this is load
bearing (the right-to-left direction is used directly in, e.g., the constraint-family proofs).

**2026-09-07 wave — two changes inside this block, both load bearing:**

1. **`def:directed` was folded in.** The opening clause now defines `$\supseteq$-directed`
   inline ("Letting a nonempty family of sets $\mathcal{S}$ be *$\supseteq$-directed* just in
   case …"), and the standalone `def:directed` label is gone (recorded `DANGLING` above). The
   `$\subseteq$-directed` half was dropped entirely — the paper no longer defines it anywhere, so
   any in-tree prose describing `def:directed` as "split into a `⊇` and a `⊆` clause" is
   describing a definition that no longer exists.
2. **The ball-space footnote was softened from "strictly stronger" to "at least as strong as".**
   The paper now says *Saturation* ($\mathbf{S}_1^d$) "is at least as strong as the standard
   *spherically complete* condition, which is $\mathbf{S}_1$ itself". The strictness claim was
   withdrawn, not merely reworded: `\mathbf{S}_1^d \Rightarrow \mathbf{S}_1` is asserted, and
   the converse is no longer denied. In-tree prose asserting **strict** strengthening now overstates
   the paper. (The 2026-08-25 narrative table below records the *old*, strict wording; it is
   historical and is deliberately left as written.)
   Also in this block: "for $x, y \geq 0$" became "for all positive durations $x, y \geq 0$" —
   wording only, no change to the quantifier's range.

### `lem:nullity` — DERIVED: `w ⇒₀ w` (Nullity is not an axiom)

```latex
\begin{Lthm} \label{lem:nullity}
	$w \Rightarrow_0 w$ for every world state $w \in W$ in every task frame $\F = \tuple{W, \D, \Rightarrow}$.
\end{Lthm}
```
sha256: `94ed018343635a8ef6671daef07eaa72da1cb49fd11043fb3aa9b391a2c9c973`

Proved (per the paper) from Seriality at `x = 0` plus Limit — choice-free, unlike `thm:extension`
below which needs Zorn's lemma.

### `def:world-history` — partial history, convex history, possible world, the extension order, `H_F`

```latex
\begin{Ddef} \label{def:world-history}
	A \textit{partial history} over a task frame $\F = \tuple{W, \D, \Rightarrow}$ is a function $\tau : X \to W$ on a nonempty set $X \subseteq D$ where $\tau(x) \Rightarrow_{y-x} \tau(y)$ for all times $x, y \in X$.
	A \textit{convex history} is any partial history whose domain $X$ is \textit{convex}, so that $y \in X$ whenever $x, z \in X$ and $x < y < z$.
  A \textit{possible world} is any convex history whose domain is total, so that $X = D$.
	A partial history $\sigma$ \textit{extends} $\tau$ just in case $\dom{\tau} \subseteq \dom{\sigma}$ and $\tau(x) = \sigma(x)$ for all $x \in \dom{\tau}$.
	The set of all possible worlds over $\F$ is denoted $H_{\F}$.
\end{Ddef}
```
sha256: `550661d3b388c3ef494ffb81c643ab5a550f996a5a86329afc557f41ed7872e7`

Layering, exactly as the paper states it: **partial history** (nonempty domain, no convexity
requirement) → **convex history** (convex domain) → **possible world** (`X = D`). The
vocabulary "task-constrained function" is retired paper-wide and must not be reintroduced as
current terminology (see the paper-refactor cluster's task descriptions, which record the same
point). `H_F` denotes the *possible worlds*, not the convex histories.

### `thm:extension` — every partial history extends to a possible world

```latex
\begin{Tthm} \label{thm:extension}
	Every partial history $\tau : X \to W$ over a task frame $\F = \tuple{W, \D, \Rightarrow}$ is extended by some possible world $\sigma \in H_{\F}$.%
	  \footnote{
	    The proof appeals to Zorn's lemma, and so the derivation of \textit{Occurrence} from \textit{Seriality} and \textit{Saturation} in \textbf{\ref{cor:occurrence}} is a theorem of ZFC, in contrast with the derivation of the zero loops in \textbf{\ref{lem:nullity}} and the derivation of \textit{Saturation} for finite $W$ in \textbf{\ref{cor:saturation-finite}}, both of which are choice-free.
	  }
\end{Tthm}
```
sha256: `65811dcff91a3dd840058353b14667d8abfcf5d94c8be9979944f03be5234379`

### `cor:occurrence` — DERIVED: every world state occurs at any prescribed time in some possible world (renamed from `thm:occurrence`; see "Drift correction" below)

```latex
\begin{Cthm} \label{cor:occurrence}
	For any task frame $\F = \tuple{W, \D, \Rightarrow}$, world state $w \in W$, and time $x \in D$, there is a possible world $\tau \in H_{\F}$ where $\tau(x) = w$, and so $H_{\F} \neq \emptyset$.
\end{Cthm}
```
sha256: `231c1d3cd0bf70a323775c623ed36761c6e0c4990bf72106c8323a9fe78842ec`

Follows from `thm:extension`, hence is also a ZFC (not choice-free) result. The paper merged the
former `thm:occurrence` (existential over both the history and the time) with a separate
`app:nonempty` corollary into this single, strictly stronger statement (time `x` is now given, not
merely witnessed) under the new label `cor:occurrence` — see "Drift correction" below. Its
current proof extends the one-point partial history `{⟨x, w⟩}` directly via `thm:extension`; the
former translation argument is gone from this chain (time-shift machinery survives separately
under `def:time-shift-histories`, which remains untracked).

### `def:constraints` — the constraints on a new duration (renamed from "constraints *imposed on*"; see "Drift correction (2026-08-12)")

```latex
\begin{Ddef} \label{def:constraints}
	For a partial history $\tau : X \to W$ over a task frame $\F$ and duration $z \in D \setminus X$, the \textit{constraints on $z$} are the segments $[\tau(t), \tau(s)]_{z-t}^{s-z}$ for times $t,s \in X$ where $t < z < s$ when both $t,s \in X$, and the fibers $\fib{\tau(t), z - t}$ for $t \in X$ otherwise.
\end{Ddef}
```
sha256: `50aadae779c7d57c810e94209614b5cdfe2590fa82c1c0793db948e8d0917e28`

Promoted from lead-in prose to a numbered definition so the lemmas below can cite it by name.
The 2026-08-12 wave shortened the defined term to "the *constraints on `z`*" and added an explicit
"when both `t,s ∈ X`" guard to the segment case; the family being defined is unchanged. Note that
surrounding paper text (and `lem:nonempty`, untracked) still says "imposed on", so both phrasings
appear in the live paper — this record quotes whichever one appears inside the tracked block.

### `lem:nesting` — DERIVED: imposed fibers and segments nest along the time order

```latex
\begin{Lthm} \label{lem:nesting}
	For any partial history $\tau : X \to W$ over a task frame $\F = \tuple{W, \D, \Rightarrow}$ and duration $z \in D \setminus X$, the fibers $\fib{\tau(t'), z - t'} \subseteq \fib{\tau(t), z - t}$ nest for all times $t \leq t' < z$ in $X$ and symmetrically for all times $z < t' \leq t$ in $X$, while the segments $[\tau(t'), \tau(s')]_{z - t'}^{s' - z} \subseteq [\tau(t), \tau(s)]_{z - t}^{s - z}$ nest for all times $t \leq t' < z < s' \leq s$ in $X$.
\end{Lthm}
```
sha256: `ed036f28b70b99d4294515c0f1da64a62e471aa4795394cda4d9010b1f1971a7`

The block carries an in-source `% FIX:` authorial note about the `\Fib` macro's italics. That line
is literal paper source and is inside the hashed region, so it is quoted here verbatim like any
other in-block comment; it is the paper author's note to themselves, not an instruction to this
repository. Paper order places this lemma immediately after `def:constraints` and before
`lem:nonempty`, which is why both sit here rather than beside `lem:constraint`.

### `lem:nonempty` — DERIVED: every imposed constraint is nonempty

```latex
\begin{Lthm} \label{lem:nonempty}
	For any partial history $\tau : X \to W$ over a task frame $\F = \tuple{W, \D, \Rightarrow}$ and duration $z \in D \setminus X$, every constraint imposed on $z$ is nonempty.
\end{Lthm}
```
sha256: `8067bf45a360f04db7a94280bde1b359dac58e8311f2fba1d58db15bf2336598`

Note the phrasing divergence already recorded under `def:constraints`: that definition was renamed
to "the constraints *on* `z`", while this lemma (and `lem:nesting`, `lem:constraint`, `lem:fibers`,
`lem:admissible` above and below) still says "imposed on". Both phrasings are live in the paper and
both are quoted as they stand; neither is silently normalized here.

### `lem:constraint` — DERIVED: the constraint family is directed and nonempty

```latex
\begin{Lthm} \label{lem:constraint}
	For any partial history $\tau : X \to W$ over a task frame $\F$ and duration $z \in D \setminus X$, the constraints imposed on $z$ form a $\supseteq$-directed family of nonempty sets.
\end{Lthm}
```
sha256: `ca6719adfaad9f6dc3d1b6a57de013598dd80847014d9c2fb60ed626b895370f`

This lemma now states **only** directedness + nonemptiness. The admissibility characterization
that an earlier paper wave carried inside this lemma was split out into `lem:admissible` below —
task specs quoting the old merged statement are stale. Its proof consumes Compositionality in
BOTH directions plus Seriality.

### `lem:fibers` — DERIVED: membership in all constraints ⟺ fiber condition at every time — **DANGLING as of the 2026-08-17 second re-pin (removed from manifest)**

The live paper no longer carries a `\label{lem:fibers}` (the lemma was removed or absorbed in
a later editing wave the same day as the first re-pin). The quoted text below is retained as
the last-resolved historical record. If the paper restores the anchor, re-add a manifest row
via `check-paper-definitions.sh --resolve "lem:fibers|env|-|-"`.

```latex
\begin{Lthm} \label{lem:fibers}
	For any partial history $\tau : X \to W$ over a frame $\F = \tuple{W, \D, \Rightarrow}$ and duration $z \in D \setminus X$, a world state $u \in W$ belongs to every member of the constraints imposed on $z$ just in case $\tau(t) \Rightarrow_{z-t} u$ for every $t \in X$.
\end{Lthm}
```
sha256: `42ec404f8082ceeff30b1da5a28c076c9880704c92d500cb5068ce8b0a1ba7e2`

New lemma (introduced by the same wave that split `lem:admissible` out of `lem:constraint`).

### `lem:admissible` — DERIVED: one-point extension is a partial history ⟺ membership in all constraints

```latex
\begin{Lthm} \label{lem:admissible}
	For any partial history $\tau : X \to W$ over a task frame $\F = \tuple{W, \D, \Rightarrow}$ and duration $z \in D \setminus X$, the function $\tau \cup \set{\tuple{z, u}}$ is a partial history on $X \cup \set{z}$ just in case $u$ belongs to every member of the constraints imposed on $z$.
\end{Lthm}
```
sha256: `9606ef1f1264887ed51358744df7e5fc290250dd8209f445fd138700da56de8e`

Proof consumes `lem:nullity` (the zero loop at `z` itself) plus `lem:fibers`.

### `lem:step` — DERIVED: the Step Lemma (sole *Spherical* application site)

```latex
\begin{Lthm} \label{lem:step}
	Every partial history $\tau : X \to W$ over a task frame $\F = \tuple{W, \D, \Rightarrow}$ extends to a partial history on $X \cup \set{z}$ for any duration $z \in D$.
\end{Lthm}
```
sha256: `b1f65f70cc243de5b32d4e2a46c35c986dd0322cf3ca0524fb76701af3e3be4b`

Proof: `lem:constraint` gives the directed family, *Spherical* provides a common member, and
`lem:admissible` certifies the extension. Closing remark (verbatim, load-bearing for the discrete
case): "When the family has a $\subseteq$-least member, that member already contains a candidate
and \textit{Spherical} is not needed."

### `def:BL-model` — model of `BL` — **DANGLING as of the 2026-08-17 re-pin (removed from manifest)**

The live paper no longer carries a `\label{def:BL-model}` — an exhaustive grep over the current
text finds no such label. The model definition survives in the paper without this anchor name.
The quoted text below is retained as the last-resolved historical record; the anchor is removed
from the machine manifest so the checker no longer reports it as unresolvable. If the paper
restores or renames the anchor, re-add a manifest row via
`check-paper-definitions.sh --resolve "def:BL-model|env|-|-"`.

```latex
\begin{Ddef} \label{def:BL-model}
	A \textit{model} of $\BL$ is a structure $\M = \tuple{W, \D, \Rightarrow, \vert{\cdot}}$ where $\F = \tuple{W, \D, \Rightarrow}$ is a frame and $\vert{p_i} \subseteq W$ for every sentence letter $p_i \in \SL$.

### `def:BL-semantics` — the truth clauses (TruthAt), including the box clause's quantifier domain

```latex
\begin{Ddef} \label{def:BL-semantics}
	A \textit{model} of $\BL$ is a structure $\M = \tuple{W, \D, \Rightarrow, \vert{\cdot}}$ where $\F = \tuple{W, \D, \Rightarrow}$ is a task frame and $\vert{p_i} \subseteq W$ for every sentence letter $p_i \in \SL$.
	Relative to a model $\M$, possible world $\tau \in H_{\F}$, and time $x \in D$, \textit{truth} is defined recursively as follows:
	\begin{enumerate}[wide=0pt, labelsep=.1in, itemsep=.075in]
		\item[($p_i$)] $\M,\tau,x \vDash p_i$ \textit{iff} $\tau(x) \in |p_i|$.
		\item[($\bot$)] $\M,\tau,x \nvDash \bot$.
		\item[($\shortrightarrow$)] $\M,\tau,x \vDash \varphi \rightarrow \psi$ \textit{iff} $\M,\tau,x \nvDash \varphi$ or $\M,\tau,x \vDash \psi$.
		\item[($\Box$)] $\M,\tau,x \vDash \Box \varphi$ \textit{iff} $\M,\sigma,x \vDash \varphi$ for all $\sigma \in H_{\F}$.
		\item[($\since$)] $\M,\tau,x \vDash \varphi\since\psi$ \textit{iff} $\M,\tau,z \vDash \psi$ for some time $z < x$ where $\M,\tau,y \vDash \varphi$\\
      \strut\hspace{1.55in}for all $y \in D$ with $z < y < x$.
		\item[($\until$)] $\M,\tau,x \vDash \varphi\until\psi$ \textit{iff} $\M,\tau,z \vDash \psi$ for some time $z > x$ where $\M,\tau,y \vDash \varphi$\\ 
      \strut\hspace{1.55in}for all $y \in D$ with $x < y < z$.

**The box clause's quantifier domain is `H_F`** — the set of *possible worlds*, not a
maximal-history set `H^max_F` (that vocabulary is retired; the block's own `%%` comment history
above shows it was explicitly eliminated) and not an externally-supplied `Omega` subset. This is
the single most consequential clause for the current `paper-refactor` cluster: the Lean tree's
`TruthAt` (`FormalSystem/Semantics/Truth.lean:128`) still takes an explicit
`Omega : Set (WorldHistory F)` parameter and quantifies `Box` over `Omega`, not over the full
total-history set directly — that is precisely the gap the cluster's total-history refactor
closes. See "Downstream consumers" below.

### `def:BLplus-language` — the language of `BL^+` (since/until constructors)

```latex
\begin{Ddef} \label{def:BLplus-language}
	The language $\BL \coloneq \tuple{\SL,\bot,\rightarrow,\Box,\since,\until}$ where $\SL \coloneq \set{p_i: i\in \N}$ is a countable set of sentence letters and the remaining symbols denote falsity, material implication, the metaphysical necessity operator, the since operator, and the until operator, respectively.
	Well-formed sentences of $\BL$ are defined by:
	\[
		\varphi, \psi \Coloneq p_i \mid \bot \mid \varphi \rightarrow \psi \mid \Box\varphi \mid \varphi\since\psi \mid \varphi\until\psi.

### `def:BLplus-semantics` — the `\since` / `\until` truth clauses (and the argument-order footnote) — **DANGLING as of the 2026-09-07 rename-absorption re-pin (removed from manifest)**

The live paper no longer carries a `\label{def:BLplus-semantics}`. When the paper collapsed
`BL^+` into `BL`, the `\since` / `\until` clauses became clauses of `def:BL-semantics` itself
(which is pinned, and whose 2026-09-07 re-hash records exactly this change). The quoted text
below is retained as the last-resolved historical record.

```latex
\begin{Ddef} \label{def:BLplus-semantics}
  The \textit{models} of $\BL^+$ are defined as in \textbf{\ref{def:BL-semantics}}, where \textit{truth in a model} $\M$ at $\tau \in H_{\F}$ and $x \in D$ extends the semantics \textbf{\ref{def:BL-semantics}} with the following clauses:
	\begin{enumerate}[wide=0pt, labelsep=.1in, itemsep=.075in]
		\item[($\since$)] $\M,\tau,x \vDash \varphi\since\psi$ \textit{iff} $\M,\tau,z \vDash \psi$ for some time $z < x$ where $\M,\tau,y \vDash \varphi$\\
      \strut\hspace{1.55in}for all $y \in D$ with $z < y < x$.
		\item[($\until$)] $\M,\tau,x \vDash \varphi\until\psi$ \textit{iff} $\M,\tau,z \vDash \psi$ for some time $z > x$ where $\M,\tau,y \vDash \varphi$\\ 
      \strut\hspace{1.55in}for all $y \in D$ with $x < y < z$.

**Argument-order caveat — DISCHARGED 2026-08-17. There is no longer a divergence, and there is no
longer a footnote.**

Two things changed, in this order:

1. **The paper removed the footnote.** The anchor re-quoted above (`edde7517…`) is
   **footnote-free**: it carries the two `($\since$)` / `($\until$)` clauses and nothing else. Its
   two predecessors did carry an argument-order `\footnote` — first attributing a guard-first
   Pnueli convention to this repository's constructors (`3f56a996…`), then, after the paper's own
   `%% CHANGE (halden-defect-repair, untl-snce-convention)` repair, asserting the reverse
   (`f40f514e…`). Both are superseded. Neither sentence exists in the live paper, and neither
   should be quoted as current paper text; the historical quotations are retained in
   `specs/decisions/untl-snce-argument-order.md`.

2. **The Lean tree was aligned to the paper.** `Formula.untl` and `Formula.snce`
   (`FormalSystem/Syntax/Formula.lean:85-106`) now take the **guard first and the event second**,
   and `TruthAt`'s clauses (`FormalSystem/Semantics/Truth.lean:165-168`) read
   `| Formula.untl ψ φ => ∃ s, t < s ∧ TruthAt … s φ ∧ ∀ r, t < r → r < s → TruthAt … r ψ` — the
   existential witness second, the open-interval condition first, exactly as the `(until)` clause
   above states it. The migration was a uniform argument swap of the two constructors and every
   call site, carried out under
   `specs/448_migrate_snce_untl_to_guard_first_order/plans/01_guard-first-migration.md`. It is
   meaning-preserving by construction: `lake build` green at the same job count, per-file `sorry`
   census byte-identical to baseline, axiom count unchanged, and the role-keyed `toJson` oracle
   regenerating byte-identically.

Corroborated independently by `def:BLplus-defined` below, which the Lean derived operators now
match character for character: `$\past\varphi \coloneq \top\since\varphi$` →
`somePast φ = Formula.snce Formula.top φ` (`Formula.lean:157`);
`$\future\varphi \coloneq \top\until\varphi$` → `someFuture φ = Formula.untl Formula.top φ`
(`:147`); `$\Next\varphi \coloneq \bot\until\varphi$` → `next φ = Formula.untl Formula.bot φ`
(`:511`); `$\Previous\varphi \coloneq \bot\since\varphi$` → `prev φ = Formula.snce Formula.bot φ`
(`:516`).

**This is a prose repair, not a re-pin — no anchor hash moved.** The verbatim block and its
`edde7517…` checksum above are the live paper text; only this caveat, which described a footnote
that no longer exists and a Lean convention that no longer holds, was rewritten.

One residual asymmetry, deliberate and not a defect: the codebase's **prefix** rendering
`U(event, guard)` (`Formula.prettyPrint`, the machine appendix's `schema_string`, and
`asUntil?`/`asSince?`'s returned pair) remains **event-first**, unlike the constructor and unlike
the paper's infix. Each such site now says so explicitly. Flipping it is deferred; see the
"Deferred consequences" section of the decision record.

### `def:BLplus-defined` — the defined temporal operators of `BL^+` — **DANGLING as of the 2026-09-07 rename-absorption re-pin (removed from manifest)**

The live paper no longer carries a `\label{def:BLplus-defined}`. The eight defined operators

```latex

    \footnote{
      Since $H_{\F} \neq \emptyset$ for every task frame by \textbf{\ref{cor:occurrence}}, frame validity is never vacuous: every task frame contributes evaluation points, and so $\nvDash_{\F} \bot$ for every task frame $\F$.

```
sha256: `3af67167ee4a393d77fc8cfa8ddc065fe932bedf76a14febb8608a9001af5486`

This block covers **both** logical consequence (`Γ ⊨ φ`) **and** global validity (`⊨ φ`, "valid
just in case ⊨φ") — the paper defines them in the same `Ddef`. `def:frame-validity` above is the
separate, frame-relative validity notion (`⊨_F φ`); the two are distinct anchors and both are
tracked.

### `CO` / `TMP-CO` — worked example of the `\aitem`-key anchor kind — **`TMP-CO` DANGLING as of the 2026-09-07 rename-absorption re-pin (removed from manifest; `CO` remains pinned)**

The paper introduces some axioms via a custom `\aitem[KEY]{LABEL}` macro
(`\newcommand{\aitem}[2][]{\item[{\bf ...}] \refstepcounter{acount}\label{#2}%`), which sets the
**bold displayed key** to its optional first argument (or, if omitted, to the second argument) and
sets the **`\label`** (hence the `\aref`-resolvable anchor) to the second argument. This means a
single displayed key like "CO" can correspond to *two different* `\label` anchors in different
parts of the paper — exactly the case recorded here, per this task's explicit instruction to
demonstrate the mechanism handles both anchor kinds:

| Anchor (`\label`) | Displayed key | Verbatim text | sha256 |
|---|---|---|---|
| `CO` | CO | `\aitem{CO} $\always(\Past\varphi \rightarrow \future\Past\varphi) \rightarrow (\Past\varphi \rightarrow \Future\varphi)$.` | `5c468c01776c449b212c98070b5bfc70951691a23905cd4d4c249bf1f5375d41` |
| `TMP-CO` | CO (same displayed key, `BL^+` restatement) | `\aitem[CO]{TMP-CO} $\always(\Past\varphi \rightarrow \future\Past\varphi) \rightarrow (\Past\varphi \rightarrow \Future\varphi)$.` | `2205e7115342b037faeb67a24cb7679e393af582cedf6752c0c07d9a28b8f1be` |

**2026-09-07 update.** The live paper no longer carries an `\aitem{...}{TMP-CO}`: the `BL^+`
restatement of the completeness axiom disappeared with `def:TMplus-c` (now `def:BX-r`), which
*derives* `CO` from `PU` rather than restating it under a second label. `TMP-CO` is therefore
removed from the machine manifest and recorded `DANGLING`; the table row above is retained as the
last-resolved historical record. `CO` itself still resolves and stays pinned, so the worked
example of the two-anchor `\aitem` mechanism survives in half-form — a second live example is
`def:S5`'s `TMP-MK`/`MK` family should one ever be needed.

`CO` and `TMP-CO` are **not** part of `def:frame`'s four axioms (an unrelated coincidence of
abbreviation — `CO` here names a temporal continuity/completeness axiom, unrelated to `def:frame`'s
"Compositionality"). They are included to keep the extraction mechanism exercised against both
anchor kinds the paper actually uses, per this task's instruction; they are not otherwise consumed
by a live task at recording time.

### `def:TMplus-f` — the discrete Burgess–Xu tense logic BX_f, and its Z-time footnote — **DANGLING as of the 2026-09-07 rename-absorption re-pin: RENAMED to `def:BX-z` (removed from manifest)**

The paper renamed this anchor to `def:BX-z`, which is pinned below. The quoted text is retained
as the last-resolved historical record, and it is the *old* text that in-tree docstrings used to
quote: the closing sentence now attributes the ℤ-time narrowing to `prop:archimedean` plus the
§Extensions Hölder footnote rather than deriving it inline, and the systems are named
**BX**$_z$ / **TM**$_z$ rather than **BX**$_f$ / **TM**$^+_f$. Any docstring still quoting the
text below is quoting a version of the paper that no longer exists.

```latex
\begin{Ddef} \label{def:TMplus-f}
  The \textit{Discrete Burgess--Xu Tense Logic} \textbf{BX}$_f$ is the smallest extension of the base logic \textbf{BX} to include all instances of the following axioms:
  \vspace{-.125in}
  \begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=.5in,labelsep=.15in,itemsep=.075in]
    \begin{multicols}{2}
    \aitem[UZ]{TMP-UZ} $\future\varphi \rightarrow (\neg\varphi\until\varphi)$.
    \aitem[Z1]{TMP-Z1} $\Future(\Future\varphi \rightarrow \varphi) \rightarrow (\future\Future\varphi \rightarrow \Future\varphi)$.
    \end{multicols}
  \end{enumerate}
  \vspace{-.175in}
  Whereas \textbf{\aref{TMP-UZ}} asserts that if $\varphi$ in the future, then there is a \textit{nearest} future $\varphi$-time where $\neg\varphi$ throughout the intervening interval, \textbf{\aref{TMP-Z1}} is a backward induction principle that is characteristic of successor-Archimedean task frames.
  It follows by H\"{o}lder's theorem that a nontrivial discrete Archimedean totally ordered abelian group is isomorphic to $\Z$, and so the successor-Archimedean discrete class to which \textbf{BX}$_f$ and \textbf{TM}$^+_\textsc{f}$ are sound and complete is exactly $\Z$-time.
  % \textbf{TM}$_\textsc{f}$, by contrast, is sound over the full class of discrete frames, since \textbf{\aref{DF}} is valid on every discrete order and not only on $\Z$-time; whether \textbf{TM}$_\textsc{f}$ is complete over that broader class remains open, as discussed at \textbf{\ref{cor:tm-completeness}}.
  % \textbf{\aref{TMP-UZ}} and \textbf{\aref{TMP-Z1}} are not sound over non-Archimedean discrete orders: over $\Z \times_{\mathrm{lex}} \Z$, an atom true only in the second galaxy leaves \textbf{\aref{TMP-UZ}} without a first witness.
\end{Ddef}

### `def:TMplus-d` — the dense Burgess–Xu tense logic BX_d — **DANGLING as of the 2026-09-07 rename-absorption re-pin: RENAMED to `def:BX-d` (removed from manifest)**

The paper renamed this anchor to `def:BX-d`, which is pinned below. The quoted text is retained
as the last-resolved historical record; the live definition no longer inlines the `DN`/`NN`
axiom statements, citing `\S`Extensions for them instead.

```latex
\begin{Ddef} \label{def:TMplus-d}
  The \textit{Dense Burgess--Xu Tense Logic} \textbf{BX}$_d$ is the smallest extension of the base logic \textbf{BX} to include all instances of the following axioms:

The paper renamed this anchor to `def:BX-r`, which is pinned below, and re-titled the system
*Dense and Complete* rather than *Complete*. The quoted text is retained as the last-resolved
historical record. Note that the live definition's second Reynolds axiom is displayed and
labelled `SEP`, not `SP`; and the `TMP-CO` restatement quoted below no longer exists.

```latex
\begin{Ddef} \label{def:TMplus-c}
  Letting $K^+\varphi \coloneq \neg(\neg\varphi\until\top)$ and $K^-\varphi \coloneq \neg(\neg\varphi\since\top)$ abbreviate Reynolds' (1992) operators--- $K^+\varphi$ says that $\varphi$ recurs arbitrarily soon in the future, and $K^-\varphi$ that $\varphi$ recurred arbitrarily recently in the past--- the \textit{Complete Burgess--Xu Tense Logic} \textbf{BX}$_c$ is the smallest extension of the base logic \textbf{BX} to include all instances of the following axioms, due to Reynolds (1992), where only the future/until direction of \textbf{\aref{TMP-PU}} is stated, its past/since direction following by \textbf{\aref{TMP-TD}}:
  \begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=.5in,labelsep=.15in,itemsep=.075in]
    \aitem[Prior-U]{TMP-PU} $(\varphi\until\top) \wedge \future\neg\varphi \rightarrow \varphi\until(\neg\varphi \vee K^+\neg\varphi)$.
    \aitem[Sep]{TMP-SEP} $K^+\varphi \wedge \neg K^+(\varphi \wedge (\neg\varphi\until\varphi)) \rightarrow K^+(K^+\varphi \wedge K^-\varphi)$.
  \end{enumerate}
  The following axiom restates \textbf{\aref{CO}} from \textbf{TM}, and is a \textit{derived theorem} of \textbf{BX}$_c$ rather than a further axiom, using only \textbf{\aref{TMP-PU}} and the base axioms of \textbf{BX}:
  \begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=.5in,labelsep=.15in,itemsep=.075in]
    \aitem[CO]{TMP-CO} $\always(\Past\varphi \rightarrow \future\Past\varphi) \rightarrow (\Past\varphi \rightarrow \Future\varphi)$.
  \end{enumerate}
  As a result, \textbf{\aref{TMP-CO}} may be omitted from \textbf{BX}$_c$.
  % This derivation is machine-checked in the Lean 4 \href{https://github.com/benbrastmckie/BimodalLogic}{repository} for this paper, and so will not be provided here.
  % Whether \textbf{\aref{TMP-CO}} alone axiomatizes the same logic as the full triple is open: the converse derivation--- deriving \textbf{\aref{TMP-PU}} and \textbf{\aref{TMP-SEP}} from \textbf{\aref{TMP-CO}} alone--- is conjectured to fail, via an unformalized pen-and-paper sketch involving a $\Q$-flow with isolated $\neg\varphi$ points accumulating at an irrational from above; this independence is not asserted as established.\footnote{%
  %   A nontrivial Dedekind-complete totally ordered abelian group is Archimedean, hence by H\"{o}lder's theorem isomorphic to $\Z$ or $\R$.
  %   The complete class is therefore exactly $\set{\Z, \R}$ up to isomorphism, so the Dedekind-complete theory of time is $\Th{\Z} \cap \Th{\R}$ and the dense-and-complete class is exactly $\R$.
  %   In particular, no non-Archimedean order is complete.

### `def:BX-z` — the discrete Burgess–Xu tense logic BX_z (RENAMED from `def:TMplus-f`), and its ℤ-time narrowing

**Re-hashed twice on 2026-09-07**: the second time for a comment-only deletion inside the

the hash without changing a word of the live prose. The text below is the post-deletion state.

**Renamed** from `def:TMplus-f` by the paper's 2026-09 z/d/r wave. Two substantive changes came
with the rename, and in-tree prose that predates them is stale rather than merely mis-labelled:
the axiom statements are no longer inlined (the definition cites `\S`Extensions for `UZ` and
`Z1`), and the ℤ-time narrowing is no longer derived here from Hölder's theorem — the definition
now cites `prop:archimedean` for the failure of `UZ`/`Z1` over non-Archimedean discrete orders and
`\S`Extensions for the Hölder step, concluding that the discrete task frames over which
**BX**$_z$ and **TM**$_z$ are sound and complete are exactly those over ℤ-time.

```latex
\begin{Ddef} \label{def:BX-z}

  Since \textbf{\aref{UZ}} and \textbf{\aref{Z1}} fail over every discrete temporal order that is not Archimedean (\textbf{\ref{prop:archimedean}}), and the Archimedean discrete orders are exactly $\Z$-time (\textbf{\S\ref{sub:Extension}}), the discrete task frames over which \textbf{BX}$_\textsc{z}$ and \textbf{TM}$_\textsc{z}$ are sound and complete are exactly those over $\Z$-time.

**Renamed** from `def:TMplus-c`, and re-titled *Dense and Complete Burgess--Xu Tense Logic*: it
is now presented as the extension of **BX**$_d$ (not of **BX**) by `PU` and `SEP`. The second
Reynolds axiom is labelled **`SEP`**, not `SP`. `CO` remains a *derived theorem* rather than an
axiom, now derived from `PU` together with the axioms of **BX**; the `TMP-CO` restatement that the
old definition carried no longer exists (see the `CO` / `TMP-CO` entry above).

  % NEW CHANGE [fragment leftovers]: reference to the deleted fragment system TM^- replaced by a section reference.
  The completeness axiom \textbf{\aref{CO}} of \textbf{\S\ref{sub:Extension}} is a \textit{derived theorem} of \textbf{BX}$_\textsc{r}$ rather than a further axiom, using only \textbf{\aref{PU}} and the axioms of \textbf{BX}, and so is not included among the axioms of \textbf{BX}$_\textsc{r}$.
  % This derivation is machine-checked in the Lean 4 \href{https://github.com/benbrastmckie/BimodalLogic}{repository} for this paper, and so will not be provided here.
  % Whether \textbf{\aref{CO}} alone axiomatizes the same logic as the full triple is open: the converse derivation--- deriving \textbf{\aref{PU}} and \textbf{\aref{SEP}} from \textbf{\aref{CO}} alone--- is conjectured to fail, via an unformalized pen-and-paper sketch involving a $\Q$-flow with isolated $\neg\varphi$ points accumulating at an irrational from above; this independence is not asserted as established.

#### Reading note (of record) on `app:discrete` / `app:dense` / `app:complete`

The three statements above read as per-frame biconditionals — call this reading (T0):
"$\F \vDash ax$ iff $\F$ is a Discrete/Dense/Complete task frame." The (⇒) direction of
(T0) is **false** as stated: degenerate frames refute it (the tree's `staticFrame`, on which
every history is constant, validates each axiom over orders that are not Discrete/Dense/
Complete respectively). What the paper's appendix proofs actually prove — and what their
closing sentences state — is the temporal-order-level biconditional (T1):

> (∀ task frame $\F$ with temporal order $\D$, $\F \vDash ax$) iff $\D$ is
> Discrete/Dense/Complete.

**(T1) is the reading of record for this repository**: it is what the Lean tree formalizes.
The (⇐) directions of (T0) are genuinely per-frame and are the per-class soundness facts the
tree already carries. No non-degeneracy hypothesis is to be bolted onto (T0); class-level
exactness is recovered by the indicator-axiom mechanism, not by patching these statements.

### `def:deterministic` — the Deterministic frame-class predicate (standalone since the 2026-08 wave)

Split out of `def:frame-properties` by the paper: Deterministic used to be a fourth clause inside
that definition and is now a definition of its own at live paper line 2868. Added to the manifest
at the 2026-08-25 re-pin because `FormalSystem/Examples/TemporalStructures.lean` cites it, and
citing `def:frame-properties` for determinism is now wrong.

```latex
\begin{Ddef} \label{def:deterministic}
	A task frame $\F = \tuple{W, \D, \Rightarrow}$ is \textsc{Deterministic} just in case $u = v$ whenever $w \Rightarrow_x u$ and $w \Rightarrow_x v$ for $w, u, v \in W$ and $x \in D$, holding in both temporal directions since \textbf{\ref{def:task-relation}}'s converse convention already extends $x$ over all of $D$.

### `cor:saturation-finite` — every task frame with finite W satisfies Saturation, choice-free (renamed from `cor:spherical-finite`; **environment changed `Cthm` → `Lthm`** in the 2026-09-07 wave)

The manifest row was re-keyed from `cor:spherical-finite` to `cor:saturation-finite` at the
2026-09-02 rename absorption, but the prose entry below still quoted the pre-rename *Spherical*
text; it is refreshed here. The 2026-09-07 wave additionally moved the result from a `Cthm`
(corollary) to an `Lthm` (lemma) environment while leaving the statement itself word-for-word
unchanged. That is a hash-visible change even though nothing mathematical moved, because
`resolve_env` hashes the whole `\begin{…}`/`\end{…}` block. The manifest row's `kind` stays
`env` — the resolver reads the environment name off the `\label{}` line rather than being told it
— so no column but the sha256 needed re-checking. The anchor id is still `cor:` prefixed while the
environment is now a lemma; that mismatch is the paper's, and this record follows the paper.

```latex
\begin{Lthm} \label{cor:saturation-finite}
	Every task frame $\F = \tuple{W, \D, \Rightarrow}$ with finite $W$ satisfies \textit{Saturation}, choice-free.

### `cor:tm-completeness` — the Completeness corollary (TM sound but not complete; completeness carried by BL+)

```latex
\begin{Cthm}[Completeness] \label{cor:tm-completeness}
  A proof system $\mathbf{S}$ is \textit{strongly complete} over a class $\mathsf{C}$ of task frames just in case $\Gamma \vDash_{\mathsf{C}} \varphi$ (\textbf{\ref{def:class-validity}}) implies $\Gamma \vdash_{\mathbf{S}} \varphi$ for every set of sentences $\Gamma$, and \textit{weakly complete} over $\mathsf{C}$ just in case $\vDash_{\mathsf{C}} \varphi$ implies $\vdash_{\mathbf{S}} \varphi$.
  Completeness is then carried by the following $\BL$ systems:
  \begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=.5in,labelsep=.15in,itemsep=.075in]
    \item[\bf TM] Strongly complete over all task frames.
    \item[\bf TM$_\textsc{d}$] Strongly complete over the dense task frames.
    \item[\bf TM$_\textsc{z}$] Weakly complete over $\Z$-time.
    \item[\bf TM$_\textsc{r}$] Weakly complete over $\R$-time.
  \end{enumerate}
  Strong completeness provably fails for $\Z$-time as well as $\R$-time where compactness fails, and so weak completeness is the appropriate target.%
    \footnote{
      These results, together with the soundness of the corresponding systems, have been established in the Lean 4 \href{https://github.com/benbrastmckie/BimodalLogic}{repository} for this paper, and so their proofs are not reproduced here.
    }

### `cor:tm-decidability` — the Decidability corollary (open) — **DANGLING as of the 2026-08-17 re-pin (removed from manifest)**

The live paper no longer carries a `\label{cor:tm-decidability}` (the corollary is commented

no longer reports it as unresolvable. The obligation that the finished paper restore or restate
this corollary is carried by `// CONFIRM(paper):` comments in `typst/` chapters. If the paper
restores the anchor, re-add a manifest row via
`check-paper-definitions.sh --resolve "cor:tm-decidability|env|-|-"`.

```latex

%% CHANGE (halden-defect-repair, decidability-rewrite): deleted the false blanket finite-W-over-Z premise (Section proof gives two witnesses: DF for four of the five systems, CO for TM_f) and restated decidability as open, with the intersection reduction given as the target strategy rather than an established result.
%% OLD:   $\textbf{TM}$, $\textbf{TM}_\textsc{f}$, $\textbf{TM}_\textsc{d}$, $\textbf{TM}_\textsc{c}$, and $\textbf{TM}_\textsc{dc}$ are all decidable.
  Whether \textbf{TM}, \textbf{TM}$_\textsc{f}$, \textbf{TM}$_\textsc{d}$, \textbf{TM}$_\textsc{c}$, and \textbf{TM}$_\textsc{dc}$ are decidable is open.
%% CHANGE (completeness-relocation, decidability-tm-star-drop): dropped the retired \textbf{TM}$^*$ label, which is no longer carried through the paper; the intersection-reduction target and the $\mathrm{Th}(\Z)$/$\mathrm{Th}(\R)$ clause are otherwise unchanged.
%% OLD:   Decidability of $\mathrm{Log}(\text{all task frames}) = \mathrm{Log}(\textsc{Discrete}) \cap \mathrm{Log}(\textsc{Dense})$, and of \textbf{TM}$^*$, would follow from decidability of the two factor logics; likewise decidability of $\mathrm{Log}(\text{complete frames}) = \mathrm{Th}(\Z) \cap \mathrm{Th}(\R)$ would follow from decidability of $\mathrm{Th}(\Z)$ and $\mathrm{Th}(\R)$ separately.
  Decidability of $\mathrm{Log}(\text{all task frames}) = \mathrm{Log}(\textsc{Discrete}) \cap \mathrm{Log}(\textsc{Dense})$ would follow from decidability of the two factor logics; likewise decidability of $\mathrm{Log}(\text{complete frames}) = \mathrm{Th}(\Z) \cap \mathrm{Th}(\R)$ would follow from decidability of $\mathrm{Th}(\Z)$ and $\mathrm{Th}(\R)$ separately.

          The condition is vacuous in $\BL^{\equiv}$, which has no quantifiers.
          The operator-scope proviso makes $\equiv$ a congruence for the logical vocabulary--- identicals may be substituted for one another within $\rightarrow$, $\bot$, $\equiv$, and the quantifiers added below--- but not for operator terms. % as in \textbf{\S\ref{sec:Introduction}}. %: the logical constants are objective, whereas an operator may be opaque.

  % Given also $\psi \equiv \theta$, a further application of \textbf{\aref{LL}}, with $\chi \coloneq (\varphi \equiv \psi)$, replacing the occurrence of $\psi$, gives $\vdash (\psi \equiv \theta) \rightarrow [(\varphi \equiv \psi) \rightarrow (\varphi \equiv \theta)]$, which detaches with both hypotheses to give $\varphi \equiv \theta$, i.e., transitivity.

### Satisfiability — **no paper-native definition exists** (recorded as a gap, not fabricated)

The paper does not define "satisfiable" or "satisfiability" anywhere as a `\label`led `Ddef`,
`\aitem`, or otherwise-named clause. This was confirmed by an exhaustive `satisfiab` grep over the
current paper text: every occurrence is informal prose ("this is easy to satisfy", "satisfiability
in HyperLTL is undecidable" in a related-work discussion), never a definition. This is independently
corroborated by task 417's own governing description, which states the same finding in its own
words ("Satisfiability has no labeled paper definition").

**This file therefore does not, and must not, invent a satisfiability definition on the paper's
behalf** — doing so would violate this file's own charter of recording only what the paper says.
The Lean tree's `satisfiable` / `SatisfiableAbs` / `FormulaSatisfiable` (`FormalSystem/Semantics/Validity.lean:129,138,154`)
are **repository-native vocabulary**, built from `def:logical-consequence`'s consequence relation
(existential witness against `⊭ ⊥`-style unsatisfiability) but not themselves quoted from, or
citable against, any paper anchor. Any future task that wants to claim "satisfiability" as a
paper-sourced notion should be corrected to cite `def:logical-consequence` (consequence) instead,
or should first get an actual `Ddef`/`\aitem` added to the paper before this file can track it.

  because the paper-refactor cluster's descriptions quote them and commit to lemma-for-lemma
  mirroring.
- `def:task-topology` and its topology properties (`T1`, `R0`, `Discrete`) — topology is not named
  in this task's "cover at minimum" list.
- `def:derivability`, `def:soundness` — proof-theoretic, not semantic, definitions; not named in
  this task's "cover at minimum" list. **Justification refreshed 2026-09-07**: the z/d/r wave
  restated both for **TM** and the full language **BL** rather than for the retired Past/Future
  fragment system (paper lines 4031 and 4035). The restatement makes them *more* relevant to this
  repository, not less, but the exclusion stands on its original ground — they are proof-theoretic
  — and no in-tree site quotes either. Promote them the moment one does.
- `def:time-shift-histories` and the time-shift preservation lemmas.

If a future task needs to cite paper text for any of the above, add it here first (see "How to
extend this record" below), rather than quoting the paper directly in a task spec.

## Downstream consumers (informational, not authoritative — the tasks own their own scoping)

At recording time, the following live tasks quote paper anchors tracked in this file directly in
their `state.json` descriptions and should be re-checked against this file (not the paper) on any
future revision: the `paper-refactor` cluster (tasks whose `topic` field is `paper-refactor` in
`specs/state.json` — quote `def:frame`, `def:world-history`, `def:logical-consequence`,
`def:BL-semantics`'s box clause, and `def:temporal-order`/`def:task-relation`/`def:directed`
verbatim in their re-issued descriptions). See this task's own research report for the audit of
task 424's exposure to the `def:BL-semantics` box-clause / `TruthAt` architecture.

## How to extend this record

1. Identify the anchor's `\label{}` name (environment case) or `\aitem` key + enclosing label
   (item case) or `\aitem` label (aitem case) in the live paper — never a line number.
2. Run `scripts/check-paper-definitions.sh --resolve "ANCHOR|KIND|ENCLOSING|LOCATOR"` (see that
   script's `--help`) to print the currently-resolved text and its sha256.
3. Add a new `### \`ANCHOR\`` entry above quoting that text verbatim, and add a row to the
   machine-readable manifest below with the printed hash.
4. Re-run `scripts/check-paper-definitions.sh` with no arguments and confirm it reports the quiet
   case-(a) pass.

## Machine-readable manifest

`scripts/check-paper-definitions.sh` parses the fenced block below directly — it is the single
source of truth for anchor IDs, kinds, and expected hashes; the prose entries above exist for
human readability and are not machine-parsed. Columns: `anchor_id|kind|enclosing|locator|sha256`.
`kind` is one of `env`, `item`, `aitem` (see "Hashing method" above). `-` means "not applicable".

## Known anchors outside the manifest (machine-readable)

`scripts/check-module-invariants.sh`'s **C15** check asserts that every `def:`/`thm:`/`lem:`/
`cor:`/`app:`/`rmk:` citation in live, non-`specs/`, non-`Boneyard/` scope resolves *here* — never
against the live `.tex`, so C15 does not go red merely because the author edited the paper. The
manifest above covers every **pinned** anchor. This block covers the rest: anchors the tree cites
that the manifest deliberately does not pin, each with an explicit status, so that every citation
in the tree is a recorded decision rather than an accident.

Two statuses:

- **`LIVE-UNPINNED`** — the anchor resolves to a live, non-commented `\label{}` in the paper, but
  is deliberately not pinned. Pinning costs a re-quote-and-re-hash on every paper wave, and is
  warranted only where the tree quotes the anchor's *text*. These are cited by **name only** (as a
  pointer, e.g. "see `app:deterministic`"), so a pin would buy nothing. If a docstring starts
  quoting one verbatim, promote it to the manifest at that point.
- **`DANGLING`** — the anchor does **not** resolve to a live `\label{}`: it was retired, it was
  commented out, or it never existed. Every in-tree citation of one of these must say so at the
  citation site; C15 only asserts that the anchor is *recorded* here, not that the prose is honest.

<!-- KNOWN-ANCHORS:BEGIN -->
```
# anchor_id|status|note
app:ObjectiveModality|LIVE-UNPINNED|section label for the objective-modality appendix; cited as a pointer. STRUCTURALLY UNPINNABLE: resolve_env reads the environment name off the same line as the \label{}, and this label sits on its own line under a \subsection{...}% — the app:TaskSemantics precedent
app:TaskSemantics|LIVE-UNPINNED|section label for the task-semantics appendix; cited as a pointer
app:auto_existence|LIVE-UNPINNED|automorphism existence; cited as a pointer, text never quoted
app:deterministic|LIVE-UNPINNED|determinism CORRESPONDENCE theorem, not the definition; the definition is def:deterministic, which IS pinned
app:deterministic-future|LIVE-UNPINNED|the deterministic-future appendix, whose sentence sent:det uses the time store/recall operators; cited as a pointer by README.md's four-language table, which records that this repository's L⋆ is the time-register fragment the appendix actually uses. BOTH HALVES ARE NOW FORMALIZED: the positive half is sentDet_of_deterministic (Semantics/StarDeterminism.lean) and the negative half is refute_sentDet (Semantics/StarNonValidities.lean), with the (*) chain as sentDet_unfold (Semantics/StarValidity.lean). Not pinned: no docstring quotes its text -- the transcription is of the displayed sentence and the (*) chain, both cited by \label
app:drift|LIVE-UNPINNED|the non-deterministic drift frame theorem (Tthm); DriftFrame.lean discusses its PROOF (the interpolation and the compactness/finite-intersection Saturation argument), which lives in the \begin{proof} block outside the Tthm and so is not what a pin would hash; the statement itself is cited as a pointer
app:topology-r0|LIVE-UNPINNED|topology appendix; part of the block this file deliberately does not cover
app:topology-t1|LIVE-UNPINNED|topology appendix; part of the block this file deliberately does not cover
cor:no-characterization|LIVE-UNPINNED|the no-characterization corollary (Cthm); cited as a pointer, text never quoted
cor:perpetuity-valid|LIVE-UNPINNED|perpetuity principles valid; the live anchor that replaced the never-existent app:valid
def:BL-language|LIVE-UNPINNED|the BL language; cited as a pointer alongside the pinned def:BLplus-language
def:BLstar-semantics|LIVE-UNPINNED|the truth definition for the manuscript's \BL^\star, whose ($\Stability$) clause is the semantics of this repository's L⁺; cited as a pointer wherever a docstring names the ⊡ clause. Not pinned: the clause is quoted in this repository only in paraphrase. The anchor's block also covers the store/recall clauses; ITS TIME-REGISTER HALF IS NOW IMPLEMENTED as StarTruthAt over points (tau, x, v-vector) (Semantics/StarTruth.lean), with the world registers up_M/down_M deliberately still unimplemented -- recorded as an explicit exclusion in FormalSystem/StarLanguage/README.md's correspondence table
def:task-topology|LIVE-UNPINNED|topology appendix; part of the block this file deliberately does not cover
lem:deterministic-singleton|LIVE-UNPINNED|deterministic-frame singleton fibers (Lthm); cited as a pointer (StateSetTruth.lean names its choice-free direction but quotes no text)
lem:history-time-shift-preservation|LIVE-UNPINNED|time-shift preservation; cited as a pointer
prop:archimedean|LIVE-UNPINNED|the Pthm asserting that UZ and Z1 both fail over every non-Archimedean Discrete temporal order; def:BX-z cites it for the ZTime narrowing, and the tree now cites it by name at the IsZTime sites (FrameProperty.lean, FrameClassValidity.lean, Validity.lean, BLValidity.lean, Indicator.lean, LexIntWitness.lean, Semantics.lean, Correspondence/README.md, FormalFoundations.typ). Cited as a pointer; this repository does NOT check it -- it is a pen-and-paper result, and pinning would assert a verification the tree does not have. Promote to the manifest only if a docstring starts quoting its text
sent:det|LIVE-UNPINNED|the displayed sentence of app:deterministic-future, up^1 Future up^2 down^1 (Stability down^2 not-phi or Stability down^2 phi); transcribed as sentDet (Semantics/StarValidity.lean) and cited by name in StarValidity.lean, StarDeterminism.lean, StarNonValidities.lean, StarDiscrimination.lean and ForwardDeterministicFrame.lean. Cited by name only; not pinned, since the transcription is of the operator structure rather than of quoted prose. Note that \Future here is the manuscript preamble's BOXED F (universal future), not the diamond f -- checked against the display and against the (*) chain's "for all y > x" step
TMP-CO|DANGLING|the BL^+ restatement of CO; it went away with def:TMplus-c (now def:BX-r), which derives CO from PU rather than restating it under a second label. The plain CO anchor is still live and still pinned
app:nonempty|DANGLING|merged by the paper into cor:occurrence; cited only where the tree records the merge
app:valid|DANGLING|NEVER EXISTED; earlier revisions cited it at a bogus line number, corrected to cor:perpetuity-valid
cor:tm-decidability|DANGLING|fully COMMENTED OUT in the paper; retained above as a DANGLING entry
def:BL-model|DANGLING|label removed by the paper; retained above as a DANGLING entry
def:BLplus-defined|DANGLING|label removed when the paper collapsed BL^+ into BL; the defined temporal operators now sit inside def:BLplus-language's block. Retained above as a DANGLING entry
def:BLplus-semantics|DANGLING|label removed when the paper collapsed BL^+ into BL; the since/until truth clauses are now clauses of def:BL-semantics. Retained above as a DANGLING entry
def:TMplus-c|DANGLING|renamed by the paper to def:BX-r, which IS pinned; cited only where the tree records the rename
def:TMplus-d|DANGLING|renamed by the paper to def:BX-d, which IS pinned; cited only where the tree records the rename
def:TMplus-f|DANGLING|renamed by the paper to def:BX-z, which IS pinned; cited only where the tree records the rename
def:directed|DANGLING|label removed; the supseteq-directed definition was folded inline into def:frame's opening clause. Retained above as a DANGLING entry
lem:fibers|DANGLING|label removed 2026-08-17; content absorbed into lem:admissible's proof; retained above
thm:BLplus-NextPrevious|DANGLING|label removed with the BL^+ fragment cluster. Retained above as a DANGLING entry
thm:BLplus-PastFuture|DANGLING|label removed with the BL^+ fragment cluster. Retained above as a DANGLING entry

**Adding a row here is a decision, not a formality.** Before adding a `LIVE-UNPINNED` row, confirm
the anchor really does resolve to a non-commented `\label{}` in the live paper. Before adding a
`DANGLING` row, confirm it really does not, and fix the citation site to say so. If neither is
true, the citation is a typo and the fix is to correct the citation, not to add a row.

## Untracked sources

Not every passage of the paper this repository relies on is anchorable. `resolve_text` in
`scripts/check-paper-definitions.sh` supports exactly two anchor kinds — `env`, resolved by
grepping for `\label{...}`, and `aitem`, resolved by `\aitem{...}` — and errors on anything else.
A passage carrying neither marker therefore cannot be given a manifest row: the row would be a
dangling anchor and the check would fail on it. The paper is read-only input to this repository,
edited elsewhere, so adding a `\label` is not an option either.

Such passages are recorded here in prose instead, so that the reliance is visible even though it
is unverifiable by the lint. **Do not promote any entry in this section to a manifest row** unless
the passage has acquired a resolvable anchor upstream first.

### The finite-case effectiveness footnote

- **Location**: `JPL/possible_worlds.tex`, in the footnote attached to the discussion of the
  finite case (at the time of recording, line 1648). No `\label`, no `\aitem`.
- **Relied on by**: `FormalSystem/Metalogic/Decidability/BiLasso/Agreement.lean`, which quotes it
  verbatim in its module docstring, and the two `extend_periodic` theorems it introduces —
  `FormalSystem.Metalogic.Decidability.IntPresentation.extend_periodic` (effective, presented
  frames) and `FormalSystem.Semantics.TaskFrame.extend_periodic` (general finite carrier).
- **Text**:

  > In this case, the conclusion of \textbf{\ref{thm:extension}} becomes effective without appeal
  > to Zorn's lemma: since $W$ is finite, the forward and backward orbits extending a bounded
  > convex history must each revisit a world state, so every bounded convex history extends to a
  > possible world that is eventually periodic in both directions--- a finite prefix plus a finite
  > cycle each way--- and is therefore finitely representable, licensing a finite certificate that
  > a given bounded history is a fragment of a possible world.

  Re-quoted 2026-09-07 from the live paper alongside the `def:world-history` vocabulary
  alignment: the footnote formerly read "bounded world history" in both places and now reads
  "bounded convex history", and it gained a comma after "In this case". This source is
  **untracked** — it carries no `sha256:` line and no manifest row, and is not read by
  `scripts/check-paper-definitions.sh` — so re-quoting it moves no pin and re-runs no checker.
  `FormalSystem/Metalogic/Decidability/BiLasso/Agreement.lean`, which block-quotes the same
  footnote in its module docstring, was re-quoted in the same change.

- **What the formalisation preserves**: the doubly ultimately-periodic extension and the finite
  certificate, both in full. "Without appeal to Zorn's lemma" is preserved as *no Zorn* — an
  import-graph fact — and **not** as choice-freedom in Lean's sense, which is a claim about a
  different axiom. The measured accounting lives in `extend_periodic`'s own docstring.

## Invocation from skills or hooks — decision (recorded, not implemented)

CI cannot enforce this lint: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` has no visibility into
`/home/benjamin/Philosophy/Papers/` (a different repository entirely), so wiring it into CI would
require vendoring or submoduling the paper, which is explicitly out of scope for this task.

**Decision**: `scripts/check-paper-definitions.sh` should be invoked manually for now, in the same
family as its siblings (`check-copyright-headers.sh`, `check-module-invariants.sh`,
`readme-lint.sh`, `typst-sync-check.sh`), none of which are CI- or hook-wired either. The strongest
candidate for automatic invocation, if this is revisited, is a **skill preflight hook** for the
`paper-refactor` topic specifically (e.g. `/research`, `/plan`, `/implement` preflight for a task
whose `topic` is `paper-refactor`) — that is the exact population of tasks that quotes this file's
anchors and would benefit from an automatic staleness check before dispatch. A git pre-commit hook
was considered and rejected: this repository's commits do not touch the paper file at all (it
lives in a separate repository), so a pre-commit hook here would never fire on the event that
actually causes drift. **Implementing either integration is explicitly out of scope for this task**
(deliverable 2 is the lint script itself); this section records the recommendation for whoever
picks up that follow-on work.
