# Every TM⁺ theorem is a TM⋆ theorem at its embedded formula

The backward half of the L⁺ ⊂ L⋆ conservativity pair:

```
TM⁺ ⊢⁺[fc] φ  ⟹  TM⋆ ⊢⋆[fc] ofPlus φ,   at every frame class and every context.
```

Unlike the base-language bridge (`Metalogic/Conservativity/Backward.lean`) no axiom-discharge
table is needed: `StarAxiom.ofPlusAxiom` sends each TM⁺ schema to its TM⋆ **mirror constructor**
at `ofPlus`-instantiated arguments, exactly as `PlusAxiom.ofTM` does one level down.

**`ofPlusAxiom` is a derived function, not a constructor.** TM⋆ used to carry the TM⁺ block as a
single primitive arm of shape `PlusAxiom φ → StarAxiom (ofPlus φ)`, which made this recursion's
`axiom` case one line but confined every inherited schema to `ofPlus` instances. That arm is
gone: the schemata are declared directly over `StarFormula` (`StarLanguage/Axioms.lean`), and the
embedding is *recovered* here as a theorem about them. It adds nothing to TM⋆ — every arm is a
constructor application at embedded arguments — while the schemata themselves reach
register-carrying formulas.

Three arms consume a side condition, and each gets it from a transfer lemma in
`StarLanguage/Formula.lean`: `modal_future` from `recallFree_ofPlus`, and `paste`/`untl_paste`
from `starIsPureFuture_ofPlus` / `starIsPurePast_ofPlus`. Nothing in `ofPlus`'s image mentions a
register, so all three discharge unconditionally.

Six of the seven derivation cases are structural. The seventh, `temporal_duality`, transports
along `ofPlus_swapTemporal` (`StarLanguage/Formula.lean`) — the one commutation in the family
that is an induction rather than a `rfl`.

## Main Results

- `StarAxiom.ofPlusAxiom` — every TM⁺ schema as its TM⋆ mirror at the embedded formula
- `StarAxiom.minFrameClass_ofPlusAxiom` — the embedding preserves the minimum frame class,
  proved as **one** named `cases` lemma rather than 53 inline `rfl`s, so a routing mismatch
  between `PlusAxiom.minFrameClass` and `StarAxiom.minFrameClass` is a named failure at a single
  site
- `StarDerivationTree.ofPlusTree` — the seven-case structural recursion on derivations
- `starDerivable_of_plusDerivable` — its `Prop`-level form
- `starDerivable_of_derivable` — composed with `plusDerivable_of_derivable`, the L ⊂ L⋆
  backward direction, and the backward half of `starDerivable_ofFormula_iff`
  (`Metalogic/Conservativity/Star/Forward.lean`)

## The forward direction is elsewhere, and is not symmetric

`TM⋆ ⊢⋆ ofPlus φ ⟹ TM⁺ ⊢⁺ φ` is **not** proved here and is not proved by any syntactic route:
register erasure is refuted as a translation (`Semantics/StarNonValidities.lean`,
`storeG_recall_valid` with `refute_erasure`). It is treated semantically, and only conditionally,
in `Metalogic/Conservativity/Star/Forward.lean`. The forward direction over the *base* language
`TM⋆ ⊢⋆ ofPlus (ofFormula φ) ⟹ TM ⊢ φ` is unconditional, because TM has completeness engines and
TM⁺ does not.

/--
**Every TM⁺ schema as its TM⋆ mirror, at the embedded formula.** A 53-arm dispatch, one arm per
`PlusAxiom` constructor, each sending it to the `StarAxiom` constructor of the same name at
`ofPlus`-instantiated arguments. `ofPlus` commutes with every formula constructor and with every
derived operator definitionally (`StarLanguage/Formula.lean`'s `rfl` pins), so each arm is a bare
constructor application.

**Derived, not primitive.** This was a *constructor* of `StarAxiom` until the schema block was
re-declared over `StarFormula`; it is now a function provable from those constructors, and it
adds nothing whatever to TM⋆. That is what makes the retirement real rather than a rename: the
embedding survives as a theorem, and the schemata it embeds are no longer confined to its
image.

Three arms discharge a side condition the `PlusAxiom` mirror does not carry, or carries in its
L⁺ form: `modal_future` supplies `recallFree_ofPlus` (no embedded formula contains a `↓ⁱ`), and
`paste`/`untl_paste` supply `starIsPureFuture_ofPlus` / `starIsPurePast_ofPlus`.

Mirror of `PlusAxiom.ofTM` (`PlusLanguage/Derivation.lean`) one level down.

/-- **The embedding of axioms preserves the minimum frame class.** One named `cases` lemma over
`PlusAxiom` rather than 53 inline `rfl`s at the use sites: if `StarAxiom.minFrameClass` ever
disagreed with `PlusAxiom.minFrameClass` on some schema — which would silently break backward
conservativity — the failure would surface here, at a single named site, instead of at whichever
consumer happened to need that arm. Mirror of `PlusAxiom.minFrameClass_ofTM`. -/

**The backward conservativity bridge for L⁺ ⊂ L⋆.** Every TM⁺ derivation becomes a TM⋆
derivation of its embedding, at the same frame class and over the embedded context. Seven cases,
one per rule; the `axiom` case goes through `StarAxiom.ofPlusAxiom` and is gated by
`StarAxiom.minFrameClass_ofPlusAxiom`, the `temporal_duality` case transports along
`ofPlus_swapTemporal`, and the rest are structural.
