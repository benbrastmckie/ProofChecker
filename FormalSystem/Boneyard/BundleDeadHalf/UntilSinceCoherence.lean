# Until/Since Coherence: Backward Direction (archived)

This module previously provided backward Until and backward Since lemmas for
FMCS families over Int, intended for the truth lemma's Until/Since cases:
given a witness pattern (ψ at some s ≥ t, φ on guard [t, s)), derive
(φ U ψ) ∈ fam.mcs t.

## Archival

The entire declaration body — two 3-link chains rooted at sorried reflexive
base cases —

- `backward_until_reflexive` → `backward_until_from_step` → `backward_until_coherent`
- `backward_since_reflexive` → `backward_since_from_step` → `backward_since_coherent`

has been moved verbatim to `Boneyard/SorriedDeclExcisions/UntilSinceCoherence.lean`.
The reflexive base cases became unprovable when reflexive Until/Since
introduction was invalidated under open guard (t,s) semantics, and no live code
consumed any of the six declarations. The truth-lemma pipeline instead reaches
backward Until/Since coherence via the restricted BFMCS route (see
`BXCanonical/Chronicle/ChronicleToCountermodelBasic.lean`'s
`RestrictedBackwardUntilSinceCoherent` structure field, a distinct
identifier).

This file intentionally retains its import block (preserving transitive imports
for its importer) and declares nothing.
