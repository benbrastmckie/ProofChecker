# Modal Saturation for BFMCS

This module implements modal saturation for Bundle of Maximal Consistent (fc := FrameClass.Base)
Sets (BFMCS),
enabling the elimination of the `modal_backward` sorry in Construction.lean.

## Overview

A **modally saturated** BFMCS satisfies the property that every Diamond formula that
is true in some family has a witness family where the inner formula is true. This
enables proving `modal_backward` by contraposition:

1. Suppose phi is in ALL families' MCS at time t, but Box phi is not in fam.mcs t
2. By MCS negation completeness: (Box phi).neg = Diamond (neg phi) is in fam.mcs t
3. By modal saturation: exists witness family fam' where (neg phi) is in fam'.mcs t
4. But phi is in ALL families, including fam' - contradiction

## Main Definitions

- `IsModallySaturated`: Predicate for modal saturation of a BFMCS
- `saturated_modal_backward`: Proves modal_backward for saturated BFMCS
- `SaturatedBFMCS`: A BFMCS bundled with saturation proof

## Design Notes

The key insight is that modal saturation is a SUFFICIENT condition for modal_backward.
Rather than constructing a saturated BFMCS from scratch, we define the saturation
predicate and prove that any BFMCS satisfying it has the modal_backward property.

## Phase 1: Saturation Predicate and Supporting Infrastructure
-/

/--
A Diamond formula in a family's MCS needs a witness if no other family
in the BFMCS contains the inner formula in its MCS at that time.

Specifically: needs_modal_witness B fam t psi means:
- Diamond psi is in fam.mcs t
- There is no family fam' in B.families where psi is in fam'.mcs t
-/
private def needs_modal_witness (B : BFMCS D) (fam : FMCS D) (t : D) (psi : Formula) : Prop :=
  psi.diamond ∈ fam.mcs t ∧ ∀ fam' ∈ B.families, psi ∉ fam'.mcs t

/--
A BFMCS is modally saturated if every Diamond formula that is true in some
family's MCS has a witness family in the bundle.

Formally: for every family fam, time t, and formula psi,
if Diamond psi is in fam.mcs t, then there exists fam' in families
where psi is in fam'.mcs t.
-/
def IsModallySaturated (B : BFMCS D) : Prop :=
  ∀ fam ∈ B.families, ∀ t : D, ∀ psi : Formula,
    psi.diamond ∈ fam.mcs t → ∃ fam' ∈ B.families, psi ∈ fam'.mcs t

/--
Alternative formulation: a BFMCS is modally saturated iff no Diamond formula
needs a witness.
-/

## Diamond Formula Properties

These lemmas connect Diamond formulas with MCS properties.
-/

/--
The Diamond formula unfolds to: neg (Box (neg phi)).
-/
lemma diamond_eq (phi : Formula) :
    phi.diamond = Formula.neg (Formula.box (Formula.neg phi)) := rfl

/--
If Diamond psi is in an MCS, then Box (neg psi) is not in that MCS.

This follows from MCS consistency: Diamond psi = neg (Box (neg psi)),
so having both would violate consistency.
-/
lemma diamond_excludes_box_neg {S : Set Formula}
    (h_mcs : SetMaximalConsistent (fc := FrameClass.Base) S)
    (psi : Formula) (h_diamond : psi.diamond ∈ S) :
    Formula.box (Formula.neg psi) ∉ S := by
  intro h_box
  have h_eq : psi.diamond = Formula.neg (Formula.box (Formula.neg psi)) := rfl
  rw [h_eq] at h_diamond
  exact set_consistent_not_both h_mcs.1 (Formula.box (Formula.neg psi)) h_box h_diamond

/--
If Diamond psi is in an MCS and psi is not in that MCS, then neg psi is in the MCS.

This is by MCS negation completeness.
-/
lemma diamond_and_not_psi_implies_neg {S : Set Formula}
    (h_mcs : SetMaximalConsistent (fc := FrameClass.Base) S)

    Formula.neg psi ∈ S := by

## MCS Existence for Consistent (fc := FrameClass.Base) Formulas

We need to show that if Diamond psi is in an MCS, then psi is consistent
(can be extended to an MCS).
-/

/--
If Diamond psi is in a SetMaximalConsistent (fc := FrameClass.Base) S, then psi is set-consistent
(i.e., {psi} is consistent).

**Proof Sketch**:
If {psi} is inconsistent, then psi derives bot, so neg psi is a theorem.
Then Box (neg psi) is a theorem (by necessitation). Then Box (neg psi)
is in S (theorems are in MCS). But Diamond psi = neg (Box (neg psi)) is
in S, contradicting consistency.

## REMOVED: Constant Witness Family Definitions

The following definitions were archived to
archive/Metalogic_v7/Bundle/ConstantWitnessFamily_ModalSaturation.lean:
- extendToMCS, extendToMCS_contains, extendToMCS_is_mcs
- constantWitnessFamily
- constantWitnessFamily_mcs_eq
- constructWitnessFamily
- constructWitnessFamily_contains

WHY: The constant witness family approach (mapping all times to the same MCS)
is fundamentally flawed. Constant families cannot satisfy forward_F/backward_P
because temporal saturation (F(psi)->psi within a single MCS) is impossible.
Counterexample: {F(psi), neg(psi)} is consistent but violates F(psi)->psi.

DO NOT reintroduce constant witness families for modal saturation.

## Phase 4: Modal Backward from Saturation

The key theorem: if a BFMCS is modally saturated, then modal_backward holds.
This is proven by contraposition using MCS negation completeness.
-/

/--
**Key Theorem**: Modal backward holds for saturated BFMCS.

If a BFMCS is modally saturated, then for any family fam, time t, and formula phi:
if phi is in ALL families' MCS at time t, then Box phi is in fam.mcs t.

**Proof by Contraposition**:
1. Assume phi is in all families but Box phi is NOT in fam.mcs t
2. By MCS negation completeness: neg(Box phi) is in fam.mcs t
3. Use boxDneTheorem to show: neg(Box phi) implies neg(Box(neg neg phi)) = Diamond(neg phi)
4. By modal saturation: exists fam' where neg phi is in fam'.mcs t
5. But phi is in ALL families including fam' - contradiction with consistency
