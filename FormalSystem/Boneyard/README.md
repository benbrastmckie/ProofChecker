# Boneyard -- Archived Dead Code

This directory contains archived Lean code that is no longer part of the active
development path. Files are preserved for historical reference, documentation of
dead-end approaches, and potential future consultation.

## CONVENTION WARNING: this tree is EVENT-FIRST and predates the guard-first migration

**`Formula.untl` and `Formula.snce` in the live tree take the GUARD first and the EVENT
second.** Every file in this directory predates that change and reads them the **other way
round** — event first, guard second, with two named exceptions below.

Nothing here was migrated, deliberately. This tree is not compiled: no built `.olean` lies under
any `Boneyard` path, no live module imports one, and `lakefile.lean`'s `lean_lib FormalSystem`
roots only `FormalSystem`. Rewriting ~1,900 occurrences that no compiler would ever check is pure
added risk with no verification available, so the migration excluded both Boneyard trees and left
this banner instead.

**If you resurrect a file from here, swap the two arguments of every `untl` and `snce` — in
constructor applications, in `match`/`induction` patterns, and in docstrings — before doing
anything else.** The swap is meaning-preserving only when it is uniform; a half-swapped file
compiles and silently means something different. Cross-check the result against
`FormalSystem/Syntax/Formula.lean`'s constructor docstrings and
`FormalSystem/Semantics/Truth.lean`'s clauses, and note that the prefix rendering `U(event, guard)`
emitted by `Formula.prettyPrint` is still event-first and is *not* the constructor order.

### The first exception: `BundleDeadHalf/`

[`BundleDeadHalf/`](BundleDeadHalf/README.md) is **guard-first**, like the live tree, and needs
**no** argument swap on resurrection. Its six modules were live-tree files at the moment they were
archived, long after the migration, so they already read the current way round. They carry 14
`untl`/`snce` occurrences across 12 lines in 2 files — `SuccRelation.lean` 12, `CanonicalFrame.lean`
2. Applying the banner's swap to them would silently invert their meaning while still compiling,
which is exactly the failure the banner exists to prevent. Check a directory's own README before
swapping anything.

### The second exception: `RetiredTactics/`

[`RetiredTactics/`](RetiredTactics/README.md) is **guard-first** for the same reason
`BundleDeadHalf/` is: its contents were live-tree files at the moment they were archived, long
after the migration. No argument swap on resurrection.

Both files there are **excerpts** rather than whole archived modules — the tactic declarations
lifted out of `Automation/Normalization.lean` and `Automation/Tactics/Helpers.lean`, whose
surviving halves are still live — plus the two Aesop modules, which were moved whole.

See `specs/decisions/untl-snce-argument-order.md` for the full record.

## One Archive, and the Counts That Describe It

There is exactly **one** archive directory in this repository, and this is it. There used to be
two -- a second one nested inside the live tree at
`FormalSystem/Metalogic/WeakCanonical/Kamp/Boneyard/` -- and the split was a standing trap: any
`find` or `grep` filter naming only this directory silently counted ~29,000 archived lines as
live code. Several past descriptions of this repository's size were wrong for exactly that
reason. That archive has been merged into [`Kamp/KampWeakCanonical/`](Kamp/KampWeakCanonical/README.md),
and the four Kamp-facing approach directories that used to sit at this level joined it under
[`Kamp/`](Kamp/README.md).

**This section is the single source for the archive's counts. Every other file that needs them
links here rather than restating them.**

| Quantity | Value |
|----------|------:|
| Archived `.lean` files | 163 |
| Archived lines | 90,797 |
| Top-level subdirectories | 37 |
| Archive directories in the repository | 1 |

Those figures are a snapshot; the **live** source is the invariant script, which recomputes them
on every run and is what any claim about them should cite:

```bash
bash scripts/check-module-invariants.sh              # B0 self-test + C7 live inventory
bash scripts/check-module-invariants.sh --no-build   # structural checks only
```

B0 asserts that the count of `Boneyard` directories is exactly **1** and reports how many `.lean`
files the exclusion removes; C7 reports the live inventory. Do not hand-roll a count. If you must,
the filter is a name glob, never a path prefix -- that is what makes a second archive reappearing
anywhere under `FormalSystem/` a gate failure rather than a silent miscount:

```bash
find FormalSystem -name '*.lean' -not -path '*/Boneyard/*'
```

## Identifiers Here Predate the Mathlib Naming Migration

**The declaration names in this directory were deliberately left untouched** when the rest of the
library was migrated to Mathlib naming conventions. Expect `snake_case` `def`s here
(`truth_at`, `all_future`, `nf_eval_nf`) that no longer exist anywhere in live code — roughly
**8,718 stale references across 93 files**. This is a recorded, accepted cost, not an oversight.

The reason is mechanical. The migration rewrote identifiers by position, driven by the resolved
references the elaborator records in `.ilean` artifacts, which is what made it safe: 47.2% of the
old final components are a proper prefix of another project identifier, so a textual pass would
have corrupted nearly half the sites it touched. This directory has **zero** `.ilean` artifacts
and **zero** imports from active code — nothing here is built — so the resolved-reference
mechanism structurally cannot cover it, and the textual fallback would face the full prefix
hazard with no build to catch the errors.

Consequences for anyone reading or reviving a file from here:

- A name found here will generally not resolve against live code. Translate it first; the
  rule is in [`docs/development/NAMING_CONVENTION_DEVIATION.md`](../../docs/development/NAMING_CONVENTION_DEVIATION.md).
- Do **not** grep this directory when auditing live identifier usage. It will produce thousands
  of false positives.
- Reviving a file means renaming its identifiers as part of the revival, exactly as the
  "still compiled when archived" caveat below already implies for its build state.

## Archival Criterion

A file belongs here when it is **unreachable from every Lake target root** — the
`FormalSystem` and `BimodalTest` libraries and every `lean_exe` root — and is not intended
to become reachable. Unreachability alone is not sufficient: a module that is merely
not-yet-wired belongs in `scripts/module-invariants-manifest.txt`, which compile-checks
it so it cannot rot. Archiving is for code that is deliberately out of the development
path.

Archival does **not** require that a file be broken. Some entries here still compiled
when archived; where that is true it is recorded in the subdirectory README, because
once a file is inert nothing re-checks it and that fact survives nowhere else.

## Purpose

The Boneyard serves three roles:

1. **Dead-end documentation**: Approaches that hit fundamental mathematical or
   architectural barriers. Understanding *why* they failed prevents repeating
   the same mistakes.

2. **Superseded implementations**: Working code replaced by better approaches.
   May contain useful techniques or lemmas that could be adapted.

3. **Architectural incompatibility**: Code written for a different semantic
   foundation (e.g., reflexive vs strict temporal semantics) that cannot be
   directly ported to the current system.

## Important Notes

- **No Boneyard file is imported** by any active module. The entire directory is
  inert with respect to `lake build`.
- **Code may not compile**. Many files reference removed imports, deleted
  definitions, or use outdated API conventions.
- **Sorry counts are not bugs**. Boneyard sorries represent archived dead ends,
  not open proof obligations.

## Archival Reason Taxonomy

### Unsound Axioms / Semantics
Code that relied on axioms later found to be unsound under the project's semantic
foundation. Examples: BX9 (unsound under open guard semantics), T-axiom
(`G(phi)->phi`, invalid under strict temporal semantics), closed guard interval
semantics.
- Directories: TAxiomDependentCode, ClosedGuardLegacy, XuLemma321Legacy, OpenGuardInvalid

### Superseded Approaches
Working code replaced by fundamentally different (usually simpler or more
general) approaches. The archived code may compile and even be correct, but a
better solution exists.
- Directories: ChainCompleteness, NonBurgessSeed, StageInductionGapAnalysis

### Structural Dead Ends
Approaches that hit irreparable mathematical barriers: false lemmas,
non-decreasing defect metrics, perpetual deferral obstructions, or circular
dependencies.
- Directories: UltrafilterDeadCode, QuasimodelOracle, RoundRobinChain,
  DefectDirectedChain, DeadCanonicalModel, DenseChronicle, DiscreteXY

### Architectural Incompatibility
Code written for a semantic foundation that the project has since departed from.
The proof strategies may be sound under their original semantics but cannot be
adapted to the current system without fundamental restructuring.
- Directories: StrictSemanticsLegacy, BundleTemporalCoherence

## Subdirectory Details

### BXPipelineDeadCode
Two files containing dead code from the BX pipeline after Reynolds model surgery
completion. `ReynoldsModelSurgery.lean` (407 lines) contains the
deprecated `no_gaps_faithful` proof and `prior_model_is_succ_archimedean`
corollary, which are mathematically false as stated (Z+Z counterexample with
constant predicates). `ReynoldsNoGapsDeprecated.lean` (161 lines)
contains 4 dead definitions extracted from `ReynoldsNoGaps.lean`:
`no_gaps_discrete_archimedean`, `no_gaps_prior`, `prior_implies_succ_archimedean`,
and `one_class_implies_succ_archimedean` -- all had zero external references.
The completeness pipeline uses `chronicle_no_gaps` (ChronicleNoGaps.lean) and
the Reynolds pipeline via `no_gaps_discrete` instead.

### BXPipelineGapAnalysis
Two files from the dead BX pipeline gap analysis path. `ChronicleNoGaps.lean`
(165 lines) attempted chronicle-level gap elimination using Reynolds Theorem 14
adapted to the chronicle construction. `HenkinDiscreteChain.lean` (121 lines)
documented analysis of Henkin chain approaches to sorry-free `completeness_discrete`.
Both were blocked by the fundamental falsity of `no_gaps_faithful` (Z+Z
counterexample: two copies of Z with constant MCS satisfy all `PriorModelData`
hypotheses yet have a Dedekind gap). The correct path is the Reynolds pipeline
via `no_gaps_discrete`.

### BundleTemporalCoherence
Bundle-level temporal coherence code from UltrafilterChain.lean. Semantically
wrong for TM task semantics: F(phi) witnesses may come from a different world
history, but TM requires witnesses within the same history. See subdirectory
README for detailed semantic analysis.

### ChainCompleteness
Earlier chain-based completeness attempt (12 files across Algebraic/, Bundle/,
Completeness/ subdirectories). Superseded by the SuccChain approach, which was
itself superseded by the chronicle construction. Contains deterministic chains,
resolving chains, targeted chains, and witness chains.

### ClosedGuardLegacy
Four files implementing closed guard interval semantics `[t,s]` for Until/Since.
Replaced by open guard semantics `(t,s)` which correctly handles the irreflexive
temporal order. Includes axiom definitions, soundness proofs, and derived
theorems for the closed-guard system.

### ConservativeExtension
The complete `Metalogic/ConservativeExtension/` directory (4 files + its own
README), archived as a unit: `ExtFormula.lean`, `ExtDerivation.lean`,
`Substitution.lean`, and `Lifting.lean`. A self-contained development of
conservative-extension results over the base proof system. No live module
imported any of it; it was reachable only from the deleted top-level
`Metalogic.lean` aggregator. See its own README for the mathematical content.

### DeadCanonicalModel
Originally an enriched seed approach to canonical model construction (README
only). The approach is structurally unfixable: the enrichment step cannot
maintain consistency of the extended seed. The orphan-triage pass added two
archived files: `CanonicalIrreflexivity.lean` (from `Metalogic/Bundle/`, an
irreflexivity result for the dead canonical-model route with zero live
importers) and `Substitution.lean` (from `ProofSystem/`, a broken substitution
development whose sole importer was `CanonicalIrreflexivity.lean`).

### FMPVariants
`DenseFMP.lean` and `DiscreteFMP.lean` from `Metalogic/Decidability/FMP/`.
Finite-model-property statements for the Dense and Discrete TM variants. No
live module imported either file; the tableau decision procedure consumes the
Base-variant FMP interface only.

### DefectDirectedChain
Root-scoped chain construction (1,556 lines) that attempted to build MCS chains
by directing construction toward reducing a "defect" metric. Abandoned when the
defect metric was shown to not decrease monotonically through chain extension
steps.

### DenseChronicle
Three files attempting to adapt the Burgess chronicle construction to dense
orders. Hit the density gap: `G(phi)` and `untl(phi.neg, gamma)` are
semantically contradictory on dense orders but BX lacks a density axiom to derive
the contradiction formally.

### DiscreteXY
Single file with the discrete x_content/y_content approach to BurgessR3Maximal
splitting. Replaced by the direct open guard semantics approach.

### NonBurgessSeed
Legacy g_content/h_content functions from PointInsertion.lean.
The consistent case was proved, but the inconsistent case hits the same density
gap as DenseChronicle. All code is commented out and non-compilable.

### OpenGuardInvalid
27 sorry-tainted definitions from TemporalDerived.lean (1 file, 215 lines). These
relied on BX8 (reflexive Until/Since intro), BX9 (Until/Since elimination to
disjunction), reflexive temporal order (alpha -> F(alpha)), seriality, or density
axioms -- all invalid or unavailable under the current open guard (t,s) semantics.
5 definitions with proof content or downstream users are archived with full bodies;
22 are documented as type signatures only. Net active sorry reduction: 19.

### QuasimodelOracle
Oracle-based approach to constructing forward/backward MCS chains (3 files, 44
sorries). Abandoned due to backward step transfer being semantically invalid and
BX11 perpetual deferral obstruction in the round-robin variant.

### RoundRobinChain
Round-robin chain construction (2 files, 2,522 lines). Confirmed dead after
extensive research: the depth-0 base case of `forward_F` is blocked by the BX11
perpetual deferral obstruction -- an Until obligation can be perpetually deferred
to later chain stages without ever being fulfilled.

### StageInductionGapAnalysis
Dead-end proof attempts for `IsSuccArchimedean` of the chronicle limit domain
Analysis confirmed the gap scenario is genuine: the constant-MCS case
is consistent with all axioms including Z1 and Prior-UZ. Task 129 (weak/reflexive
completeness) bypasses this via a Henkin canonical model.

### SorriedDeclExcisions
Dead-sorry closure excisions: verified-dead declaration closures (each carrying
statement-position sorries) moved out of live code. Every archived declaration was
confirmed dead by word-boundary grep — zero external consumers; where consumers
exist they fall entirely inside the moved closure. Archive files follow the
never-built policy: source-file import blocks verbatim, an
`ARCHIVED (Boneyard) — never compiled.` docstring naming the moved declarations and
ending `Do not import from live code.`, `#exit` before the first declaration, then
the excised code verbatim. Stale imports are never repaired and no path here is a
lakefile target. File inventory (see subdirectory README for details):
`Ghr93ForwardToBackwardChain.lean` (7 decls), `AlgebraicGQuotChain.lean` (5 decls),
`WeakTruthLemmaCluster.lean` (12 decls), `SingletonSorriedDecls.lean` (3 decls),
`UntilSinceCoherence.lean` (6 decls), `BundleUntilSinceStep.lean` (7 decls, from the
`## Until/Since Step Properties` section of `Bundle/SuccRelation.lean`). A related 24-decl
closure went to `StaviDiscretePath/` instead (see that section).

### SoundnessVariants
`DenseSoundness.lean` and `DiscreteSoundness.lean` from the top level of
`Metalogic/`. Thin wrapper modules for the Dense and Discrete soundness
variants with zero live importers. The live `soundness_dense` and
`soundness_discrete` theorems are proved in `Metalogic/Soundness.lean`, so
these wrappers were pure orphans.

### StaviDiscretePath
Discrete Stavi completeness path (EF game pipeline) with no live consumers:
`DiscreteGameTransfer.lean`, `DiscreteStaviCompleteness.lean`, `NFGameBridge.lean`.
Also holds `StaviExpressiveCompletenessTail.lean` (24 decls, 3 sorries) — the
dead expressive-completeness tail of `WeakCanonical/EFGames/StaviCompleteness.lean`,
archived under the SorriedDeclExcisions never-built conventions (imports verbatim,
ARCHIVED docstring, `#exit`, code verbatim) but placed here thematically alongside
the rest of the discrete Stavi pipeline. The tail closure was enlarged from the
originally-audited 16 declarations to its verified 24-decl fixpoint during excision
(8 pre-tail helpers whose only consumers sat inside the tail — see the
SorriedDeclExcisions subdirectory README for the list).

### StrictSemanticsLegacy
Largest archive (9 files, 14,330 lines, 107 sorries). Complete completeness
proof infrastructure written under strict temporal semantics. Includes algebraic
chains (UltrafilterChain, DovetailedChain), bundle constructions (SuccChainFMCS,
CanonicalConstruction), frame condition completeness, and top-level wiring.
Architecturally incompatible with current open-guard semantics. See subdirectory
README for file breakdown.

### TAxiomDependentCode
Three files depending on the T-axiom (`G(phi)->phi` / `H(phi)->phi`), which is
NOT valid under strict temporal semantics. Contains archived functions from
TargetedChain, CanonicalConstruction, and FMP TruthPreservation. Archived during
the reflexive-to-strict semantics migration.

### UltrafilterDeadCode
Four files documenting dead approaches removed from UltrafilterChain.lean during
a sorry-elimination cleanup (23 sorries removed). Includes F-preserving seed
(proven FALSE), bidirectional seed (H(a)->G(H(a)) not derivable), Z-chain (circular
dependencies), and CoherentZChain. Files contain documentation headers only, not
compilable code. See subdirectory README for detailed removal summary.

### UltrafilterFrame
Three files from Algebraic/: AlgebraicCompleteness.lean (the algebraic
completeness theorem built on the ultrafilter machinery), plus
TenseS5Algebra.lean (365 lines, 3 sorries for removed
axioms temp_a and temp_l) and UltrafilterFrame.lean (1,182 lines, 2 sorries for
temp_4). TenseS5Algebra defines the STSA typeclass and proves the Lindenbaum algebra
instance. UltrafilterFrame defines R_G/R_H/R_Box accessibility relations,
UltrafilterChain structure, and F/P resolution theorems. UltrafilterFrame was
commented out from Algebraic.lean due to elaboration interference with
BXCanonical/Completeness.lean rfl proofs; TenseS5Algebra's only consumer was
UltrafilterFrame. That elaboration-interference attribution has since been tested and did
not reproduce for the four `Algebraic/` modules that remain live -- which are now wired into
the build graph -- but it remains untested, and so remains in force, for these two archived
files; see the subdirectory README for the scoped adjudication. Both are prerequisites for
the Jonsson-Tarski representation theorem. Recoverable via git history.

### XuLemma321Legacy
Blocked proof-by-contradiction attempt for Xu's Lemma 3.2.1(i)/(ii). The
inconsistent case requires BX9, which was removed as unsound under open guard
semantics. Doubly obsolete: Xu 3.2.1 was later proved via `dcs_neg_union_consistent`.
See subdirectory README for recovery options.

## When to Consult the Boneyard

**Do consult** when:
- You are about to try an approach and want to check if it was already attempted
  and failed
- You need to understand why a particular axiom or semantic choice was made (the
  archived code shows what breaks under alternatives)
- You are writing documentation about the project's development history

**Do not consult** when:
- You are looking for working code to import or adapt (nothing here compiles
  reliably)
- You are trying to understand the current proof architecture (use the active
  Metalogic/ directory instead)
- You see a sorry in the Boneyard and think it needs fixing (it does not)

## Git Retrieval

To browse a file's history before archival:

```bash
# Follow renames to see original location
git log --follow --oneline FormalSystem/Boneyard/<subdir>/<file>.lean

# View file at a specific commit
git show <commit>:FormalSystem/<original-path>/<file>.lean

# Diff between archival and current
git diff <pre-archival-commit> HEAD -- FormalSystem/Boneyard/<subdir>/<file>.lean
```

To find when a file was archived:

```bash
# Check the commit that moved the file
git log --diff-filter=A --oneline -- FormalSystem/Boneyard/<subdir>/<file>.lean
```

## Boneyard Maintenance Standard

### How to Archive Files

1. **Create a subdirectory** under `FormalSystem/Boneyard/` with a descriptive name
2. **Move the file** using Boneyard-qualified import paths:
   - If the file imports other Boneyard files, use `import FormalSystem.Boneyard.<subdir>.<file>`
   - If the file imports active modules, keep those imports as-is
3. **Move imports before doc comments**: In Lean 4, `/-! ... -/` doc comments are commands;
   `import` statements must appear BEFORE any commands
4. **Add `#exit` if needed**: For files with deep API drift (removed axioms, renamed types),
   add `#exit` after imports to prevent compilation errors while preserving code for reference
5. **Create a README.md** in the subdirectory explaining why the code was archived,
   what it contained, and any relationship to active code
6. **Update this README** with a new row in the Directory Inventory table

### Build Policy: Never Compiled

Boneyard code is never compiled. There is no lakefile target covering the Boneyard;
liveness equals reachability: a module is live if and only if it is reachable from
`FormalSystem.lean` or another lakefile root. Nothing under a `Boneyard/`
directory is reachable from any root.

Import lines inside archived files are historical text, not build edges -- but they are **not**
optional. **This README used to say that stale imports in never-built code "are cosmetic and need
not be repaired". That policy is retired.** It was written before the archive had a gate, and
under it the archive rotted: 65 archived import lines named modules that no longer existed on
disk by the time the two archives were consolidated.

Check **C11** in `scripts/check-module-invariants.sh` now enforces the opposite rule. Every
`import FormalSystem.*` / `import BimodalTest.*` line under `FormalSystem/Boneyard/` must resolve
to a file on disk, or be named in `scripts/boneyard-import-waivers.txt` with a recorded reason.
C11 ships enforced, with no opt-out flag, and reports waiver entries that no longer occur so the
waiver file cannot become a backlog. A README must not carry a rule its own gate contradicts, so
the old sentence is retired here rather than quietly deleted.

The build invariants after any Boneyard change are therefore:

```bash
lake build                                    # default target stays green
bash scripts/check-module-invariants.sh       # ALL CHECKS PASSED, including C11
```

### Expected File Structure

Each Boneyard subdirectory should contain:
- `README.md` -- Purpose, file inventory, why archived, relationship to active code
- `.lean` files -- Archived code (may use `#exit` for non-compiling reference code)

Doc-only `.lean` files (pure comments, no imports) should be consolidated into the
README as prose or code blocks, then deleted. Code is always recoverable from git.

### Tombstones (README Only, No .lean Files)

After doc-only consolidation, these nine subdirectories contain only a README —
the code was deleted and the README is retained as the historical record:

- `BundleTemporalCoherence/`
- `BX1DependentCode/`
- `ClosedGuardLegacy/`
- `NonBurgessSeed/`
- `OpenGuardInvalid/`
- `StageInductionGapAnalysis/`
- `TAxiomDependentCode/`
- `UltrafilterDeadCode/`
- `XuLemma321Legacy/`

Each such README carries the first-line marker
`TOMBSTONE — code deleted; README retained as historical record.` Tombstone
READMEs are never deleted. The original `.lean` files are recoverable from git
history (commits before the doc-only consolidation).
(DeadCanonicalModel was formerly on this list; it now holds two archived files
from the orphan-triage pass — see its inventory row above.)
