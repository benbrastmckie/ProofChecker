# `lem:deterministic-singleton` as a biconditional — the (⇐) half via `thm:extension`

`FormalSystem/Semantics/PlusDeterminism.lean` carries the (⇒) half of
`lem:deterministic-singleton`: on a deterministic frame, two possible worlds agreeing on their
world state at one time agree at every time (`states_eq_of_deterministic`). This module adds the
converse, and packages the two as one biconditional.

## Main Definitions

- `TaskFrame.SingletonClasses` — `⟨τ⟩_x = {τ}` for every possible world and every time, in the
  tree's **pointwise-on-states** form

## Main Results

- `singletonClasses_of_deterministic` — the (⇒) half, a one-line application of
  `states_eq_of_deterministic`; choice-free
- `deterministic_of_singletonClasses` — the (⇐) half, via `thm:extension`; a theorem of **ZFC**
- `deterministic_iff_singletonClasses` — the biconditional `lem:deterministic-singleton` now is

## Why the pointwise-on-states form on both sides

`lem:deterministic-singleton` reads `⟨τ⟩_x = {τ}`, an equation between *sets of histories*.
The tree states both halves pointwise on states instead — "every possible world sharing `τ`'s
state at `x` shares it at every time" — for two reasons, and the choice is deliberate rather
than a weakening:

1. `states_eq_of_deterministic` already concludes pointwise state agreement, and gets it for
   free from `respects_task` plus determinism at the (possibly negative) duration `s - t`.
   History *equality* would additionally need extensionality for `ConvexHistory` at a general
   frame, which this tree does not have and does not need.
2. Pointwise agreement is *weaker as a conclusion* and therefore **stronger as a hypothesis**.
   Taking it on both sides makes the biconditional below strictly stronger than the
   history-equality form would be: the (⇐) direction assumes less, and the (⇒) direction
   concludes what every downstream consumer actually uses (`truth_congr_ext`, and its L⋆
   successor, convert pointwise state agreement into agreement on every formula).

## Choice dependence, recorded honestly

The two halves have **opposite** choice profiles, and this module is careful not to blur them.

- `singletonClasses_of_deterministic` is choice-free: it is `states_eq_of_deterministic`, whose
  `[propext]`-only pin is recorded in `PlusDeterminism.lean` and is **untouched by this module's
  existence**. Nothing here is added to that file; it gains no import of
  `Semantics/Extension/Extension.lean` and therefore no path to Zorn.
- `deterministic_of_singletonClasses` is a **theorem of ZFC**. It manufactures two separating
  possible worlds out of a two-point partial history by `thm:extension`, whose own footnote
  records that its proof appeals to Zorn's lemma. `#print axioms` on it reports
  `Classical.choice`, and the statement must never be advertised as choice-free.

That asymmetry is the general pattern for this appendix: "frame condition ⟹ validity" is the
safe direction, and "validity ⟹ frame condition" manufactures witnesses through
`thm:extension`.

## A step of the paper's proof that Lean does not need

The paper's argument for the (⇐) direction opens by deriving that `⇒_0` is the identity, from
*Limit* together with `lem:nullity`. In this tree that is the `FrameOver.nullity_identity`
**structure field** — `∀ w u, TaskRel w 0 u ↔ w = u`, available on every frame by projection —
so the paper's Step 1 is not transcribed. The `x = 0` branch of
`deterministic_of_singletonClasses` closes by `F.nullity_identity` outright.

`⟨τ⟩_x = {τ}` for every possible world and every time, in the tree's pointwise-on-states form:
any two possible worlds agreeing on their world state at one time agree at *every* time.

See this module's docstring for why the pointwise form is taken on both sides of
`deterministic_iff_singletonClasses` rather than the paper's history-equality form.

**(⇒) of `lem:deterministic-singleton`**, restated at the `SingletonClasses` predicate: a
deterministic frame has singleton stability classes.

One application of `states_eq_of_deterministic`; choice-free, and it adds nothing to that
result — the value of the restatement is that it puts both halves in the same shape, so that
`deterministic_iff_singletonClasses` is a bare `⟨_, _⟩`.

/--
**(⇐) of `lem:deterministic-singleton`** — the half `app:deterministic`'s formalization
deliberately skipped, now that it has a consumer.

Given `w ⇒_x u` and `w ⇒_x v`, the two-point partial histories `τ₁, τ₂` carrying `w` at time `0`
and `u` (resp. `v`) at time `x` are extended by `thm:extension` to possible worlds agreeing at
time `0`; `SingletonClasses` at time `0` then forces them to agree at time `x`, i.e. `u = v`.

Two transcription notes:

* The domain `{0, x}` is **not convex**, which is exactly why the argument is run at the
  `PartialHistory` layer and `thm:extension` — not `cor:occurrence` — is the tool.
* The paper's Step 1, deriving that `⇒_0` is the identity from *Limit* plus `lem:nullity`, has
  no counterpart here: `F.nullity_identity` is a structure field, and it closes the `x = 0`
  branch by itself.

**This is a theorem of ZFC**, via `thm:extension`'s appeal to Zorn's lemma.
