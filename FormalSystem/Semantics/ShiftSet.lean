# ShiftSet - The shift-set representation of task models

This module establishes the **representation theorem** relating task models to *shift sets*:
structures over the two-sorted signature `⟨Ω, D; <, +, 0, sh, (A_p)⟩` in which a single carrier
`Ω` carries a `D`-action `sh` together with a valuation on atoms.

## What the representation theorem says

Both directions are proved here, and each comes with its **truth correspondence** — a bare pair
of constructions with no transfer of `TruthAt` would type-check and yet be vacuous, since it is
precisely `TruthAt` transfer that a downstream Łoś lemma must be stated against.

- `ShiftSet.forward_repr` — every shift set `S` induces a task frame (`ShiftSet.frame`) and a
  task model (`ShiftSet.model`) whose truth at the orbit history through `w` agrees with
  shift-set truth: `TruthAt S.model (S.hist w) t φ ↔ ShiftTruth S w t φ`.
- `ShiftSet.reverse_repr` — every task model `M` over a frame `F` induces a shift set
  (`ShiftSet.ofModel`) on the carrier `F.HF` of total histories, whose shift-set truth agrees
  with truth in `M`: `ShiftTruth (ShiftSet.ofModel F M) τ t φ ↔ TruthAt M τ.val t φ`.

## Four axioms in place of seven frame fields

The `ShiftSet` structure carries exactly four axiom fields — `carrier_nonempty`, `sh_zero`,
`sh_add`, `sep` — plus the valuation `A`. The live frame
(`FormalSystem/Semantics/TaskFrame.lean`) has **seven** fields, and `ShiftSet.frame` discharges
all seven. Three of them are free consequences of the task relation being *functional*
(`TaskRel w d u := u = sh w d`) together with the group action:

- `serial` — witnessed by `sh w x` and `sh w (-x)`;
- the **interpolation** half of the biconditional `comp` — witnessed, uniquely, by `sh w x`;
- `saturation` — under a functional relation every fiber and every segment is a singleton or
  empty, so a directed family of nonempty ones is a family of copies of one singleton and its
  intersection is that singleton. No frame-theoretic machinery, and no Zorn.

Only `limit` is *not* free: it fails for an arbitrary `D`-action, and this module *proves* that
it fails, in `ShiftSet.SepNotDerivable.sep_not_derivable`: `D = ℚ` acting on `ℚ ⧸ (dyadics)`
satisfies both action laws and refutes the separation condition. The failure mode is a dense
proper stabiliser. That is what the `sep` field is for — see its own docstring.

## On `Classical.choice` in the reverse direction

`#print axioms` on `reverse_repr` reports `Classical.choice`. Its sole provenance is
`PartialHistory.hF_nonempty` (`FormalSystem/Semantics/Extension/Extension.lean`), which is
Zorn-based, and which the reverse direction uses only to witness that the carrier `F.HF` is
nonempty. This is not a defect: choice is ordinary mathematics here, and the standard this
module is held to forbids unproved placeholders, not `Classical.choice`.

A **shift set** over the duration group `D`: a carrier `Ω` with a `D`-action `sh` and a
valuation `A` on atoms.

`D` is a `TemporalOrder` — the reified `def:temporal-order` — rather than a bare `Type` plus the
four algebra binders hand-copied. That is what lets `ShiftSet.fibre` land in `FrameOver D`
directly, with no `TemporalOrder.of` in the way, and what makes `ofModel`'s target
`ShiftSet F.Duration` typecheck on the nose.

The universe discipline the earlier binder shape recorded is preserved, not relaxed:
`TemporalOrder.carrier : Type`, so `↑D : Type`, `WorldState : Type` and `Carrier : Type` all sit
where they did. A universe-polymorphic duration here would still land the reverse direction's
carrier where the forward direction could not consume it; nothing about this change opens that
door.

  **Separation** — the paper's *Limit* axiom, transcribed over the shift action: a point lying
  in every arbitrarily small shift-neighbourhood of `w` *is* `w`.

  Two facts about this field matter downstream.

  1. It is **first-order** over the signature `⟨Ω, D; <, +, 0, sh, (A_p)⟩` — it quantifies only
     over elements of the two sorts and mentions only signature symbols. It is therefore
     preserved by ultraproducts, which is exactly the property the semantic-compactness route
     needs of it. No *non-elementary* hypothesis is required anywhere in this development.
  2. The stronger **free-action** axiom `∀ w d, sh w d = w → d = 0` is **rejected** as a
     replacement. Under the reverse direction the carrier is `F.HF`, and a constant total
     history is fixed by every shift — full stabiliser — so freeness is outright refuted there
     and `ShiftSet.ofModel` could not be built. Separation is the correct weakening: it *is*
     dischargeable from `F.limit` alone (see `ShiftSet.rev_sep`), with no new frame hypothesis.

Extensionality for convex histories: equal domains and pointwise-equal states force equality.

**This is a local copy** of `convexHistory_ext`
(`FormalSystem/Metalogic/Decidability/Verified/Bridge/RegionFrame.lean`). The copy is
deliberate: importing anything under `Metalogic/` from `Semantics/` would invert the layering
this library is built on. Consolidating the two into `Semantics/ConvexHistory.lean` and
retargeting `RegionFrame.lean` is a clean follow-up, kept out of this module's scope so that the
scope stays honest.

The task frame induced by a shift set, under the **functional** task relation
`TaskRel w d u := (u = sh w d)`.

All **seven** live `FrameOver` fields are discharged here. Three come for free from
functionality plus the group action and require no shift-set axiom of their own — `serial`, the
*interpolation* half of the biconditional `comp`, and `saturation` — correcting the design
document's list, which was written against an earlier five-field frame structure and named only the
other four. The one field that is genuinely *not* free is `limit`; it is exactly `S.sep`.

The task frame induced by a shift set: its fibre, included into the total space.

The inclusion is the constructor `⟨TemporalOrder.of D, S.fibre⟩`, so `S.frame.toFibre` is
`S.fibre` and `S.frame.WorldState` is `S.Carrier`, both by `rfl`. `@[reducible]` is preserved
from the pre-fibration definition and is load bearing: `hist`'s `respects_task` proof rewrites

**The constructed frame's total histories are exactly the shift orbits.**

This is the new forward obligation the task re-issue anticipated. It is genuine — the forward
direction's `box` case consumes it, since `TruthAt`'s `box` clause quantifies over *all* total
histories while `ShiftTruth`'s quantifies over carrier points — and it is easy, following from
`respects_task` at `0` alone. It was, however, neither the only new obligation nor the hard one:
discharging `limit` (via the `sep` field) and the three "free" frame fields of `ShiftSet.frame`
was the substantive work.

Note the statement is equality of *histories*, not merely of states at each time; that is what
`wh_ext` is for.

Truth on a shift set, clause for clause parallel to `TruthAt`
(`FormalSystem/Semantics/Truth.lean`).

The `box` clause quantifies over the **whole carrier**: there is no `Omega` parameter anywhere in
the current semantics, and `TruthAt`'s own `box` clause quantifies over all total histories of
the frame, which under `ShiftSet.frame` are exactly the orbits (`total_eq_orbit`).

**FORWARD DIRECTION of the representation theorem.**

Truth in the task model induced by a shift set, evaluated along the orbit history through `w`,
is shift-set truth at `w`. The `box` case is where `hist_isTotal` (left to right) and
`total_eq_orbit` (right to left) are consumed; every other case is a structural transport.

The separation condition, discharged on total histories **straight out of `F.limit`**.

At each time `t`, `σ.respects_task t (t + y)` turns a witnessing shift `τ = σ.timeShift y` into
`F.TaskRel (σ.states t) y (τ.states t)`, and `F.limit` then collapses the two states; `wh_ext`
lifts that to equality of histories.

**No new frame hypothesis is needed.** That is precisely why the `sep` field is the right axiom
and the stronger free-action axiom is not: freeness is not dischargeable here at all — a
constant total history is fixed by every shift.

**REVERSE DIRECTION**: every task model induces a shift set.

The carrier is `F.HF`, the total histories of the frame; the action is time shift; the
separation field is `rev_sep`, and there is deliberately **no** freeness field. The valuation
reads each atom off at time `0` of the history.

## `sep` is not derivable from the action laws

The `sep` field is a genuine axiom of the shift-set notion, not a strengthening that could be
dropped and recovered. The witness below is a concrete `D`-action satisfying `sh_zero` and
`sh_add` for which the separation condition is false: `D = ℚ` acting by translation on
`ℚ ⧸ H`, where `H` is the group of dyadic rationals — a *dense proper* subgroup of `ℚ`.
Density gives the arbitrarily-small witnesses the separation hypothesis asks for; properness
(`1/3 ∉ H`) makes its conclusion false.

The `ℝ`/`ℚ` variant named in the design discussion is avoided here only because
`Mathlib.Data.Real.Irrational` is not part of this checkout's partial Mathlib build; the dyadic
variant is elementary and self-contained.

**The separation condition is not derivable from the two action laws.**

This is what justifies `sep` being a field of `ShiftSet` rather than a lemma about it: there is
a `ℚ`-action satisfying `sh_zero` and `sh_add` whose separation condition is false. Without the
field, `ShiftSet.frame` could not discharge `FrameOver.limit`, so `ShiftSet` without `sep` would
not induce a task frame at all.
