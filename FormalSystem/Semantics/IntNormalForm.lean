# The ℤ-Frame Normal Form

Over `D = ℤ` a task frame is determined by a single relation: its **one-step** relation
`step w u := TaskRel w 1 u`. This module establishes that determination in the decomposition
direction — every `FrameOver intOrder` *is* the iterate of its own one-step relation — and supplies the
arithmetic core (`iter`, `iter_add`) that the synthesis direction and the history-space
characterization both consume.

## Why ℤ, and why this is the spine

Three facts about `FrameOver intOrder` collapse the general theory to a graph-theoretic one:

- `⇒₀` is the identity — carried directly by the `nullity_identity` field. (In the paper this is
  the ℤ-instance of *Limit*: `|y| < 1` forces `y = 0` over ℤ, so the intersection of the positive
  cones of `w` is `Fib(w, 0)`, which *Limit* pins to `{w}`.)
- `⇒ₙ = step^n` for `n ≥ 0`, by induction from the paper's *Compositionality*
  (`def:frame#Compositionality`) at `x = n`, `y = 1`.
- Negative durations are the converse convention (`def:task-relation`), carried by the `converse`
  field.

Everything downstream — the characterization of `H_F` as the bi-infinite step-paths, frame
synthesis from a bare bi-serial relation, and computable model checking — rests on this.

## Main Definitions

- `iter` — `n`-fold iteration of a binary relation, `iter R 0 = Eq` and
  `iter R (n+1) w u = ∃ v, iter R n w v ∧ R v u`
- `FrameOver.step` — the one-step relation of a `FrameOver intOrder`
- `IsStepPath` — a bi-infinite walk `f : ℤ → WorldState` stepping between consecutive times
- `TaskFrame.HF.path` — the bare path underlying a possible world
- `FrameOver.HFofStepPath` — the possible world determined by a bi-infinite step-path

## Main Results

- `iter_add` — `iter R (m + n)` factors as `iter R m` followed by `iter R n`
- `FrameOver.taskRel_natCast_iff_iter` — the nonnegative core: `TaskRel w (n : ℤ) u ↔ step^n w u`
- `FrameOver.taskRel_eq_iter` — the uniform two-sided characterization, valid at every `d : ℤ`
- `FrameOver.mem_HF_iff_adjacent` — `H_F` over ℤ is exactly the set of bi-infinite step-paths
- `FrameOver.isTotal_respects_iff_adjacent` — the predicate-on-histories form of the same fact

## The Mathlib succ-Archimedean-to-ℤ transfer: binder-fit finding

`Semantics/Validity.lean`'s `ValidZTime` quantifies over duration types carrying
`[AddCommGroup D] [LinearOrder D] [IsOrderedAddMonoid D] [SuccOrder D] [PredOrder D]`
`[IsSuccArchimedean D] [IsPredArchimedean D] [Nontrivial D]`. Two Mathlib results transfer such a
`D` to `ℤ`, and they are **not** interchangeable. Both binder fits were machine-checked against
this repository's pinned Mathlib before anything here was written:

- `orderIsoIntOfLinearSuccPredArch : D ≃o ℤ` fits that bundle **verbatim** — `NoMaxOrder D`,
  `NoMinOrder D`, and `Nonempty D` all synthesize from it, so no hypothesis need be added. It is
  `noncomputable`, and it delivers only an **order** isomorphism.
- `LinearOrderedAddCommGroup.int_orderAddMonoidIso_of_isLeast_pos : D ≃+o ℤ` delivers the stronger
  **order-and-additive** isomorphism, but does **not** fit the bundle as it stands: `Archimedean D`
  does not synthesize from `[IsSuccArchimedean D] [IsPredArchimedean D]` (those are order-successor
  conditions, not the additive Archimedean property), and it additionally requires an
  `IsLeast {y : D | 0 < y} x` witness.

The distinction is load bearing rather than cosmetic. Durations *add* — `TaskRel`'s
*Compositionality* is stated at `x + y` — so a transfer that only preserves order is not enough to
carry a frame across; the additive iso is the one that is actually needed. The route for the
`ValidZTime`-to-ℤ transfer is therefore the second lemma, with `Archimedean D` and the
least-positive-element witness supplied (the successor structure is what produces the latter),
**not** a drop-in application of the first.

That route has since been taken. `Semantics/DurationClassification.lean` carries
`archimedean_of_lub` for the Dedekind-complete branch and now also the discrete branch's
successor-based analogue: `archimedean_of_succ` (the `Archimedean D` instance),
`isLeast_pos_succ_zero` (the witness), and `intIso : D ≃+o ℤ` packaging both.
`Semantics/IntTransfer.lean` transports the frame, `TaskModel`, `ConvexHistory`, and `TruthAt`
along that isomorphism, yielding `validZTime_iff_validInt : ValidZTime φ ↔ ValidInt φ`.

## What buying the right to work over ℤ is worth

The transfer above is not bookkeeping for its own sake: it is what makes the frame axioms cheap.
`FrameOver.ofStep` below discharges **all seven** `FrameOver` fields from a bare bi-serial relation
on a finite nonempty carrier, leaving exactly **one** genuine obligation — bi-seriality (`fwd` and
`bwd`). Its docstring tabulates the source of every field. So for *any* relation over `ℤ` on a
finite carrier, however non-permissive its shape, the four `def:frame` axioms cost one obligation
and nothing else. `Decidability/IntPresentation.lean`'s `toTaskFrame` is literally
`FrameOver.ofStep P.stepRel P.fwd P.bwd`, and pays exactly that.

This pricing is available **only over ℤ**, and the asymmetry is the whole reason the transfer is
worth doing first. Two of the seven discharges are ℤ-specific: `limit` comes from
`TaskFrame.limit_of_succOrder`, which needs the successor structure, and `ofStep` itself is stated
at `FrameOver intOrder`. A frame left polymorphic in `D` — such as `RefinedFilteredTaskFrame D` under
`Metalogic/Decidability/FMP/` — has neither, so each axiom must be re-discharged by hand for the
particular relation at hand. Estimates that price re-discharging the frame axioms as a large,
open-ended piece of work are measuring the `D`-polymorphic case; they do not transfer to the
ℤ case, and quoting them at a ℤ-frame overstates its cost by a wide margin.

## Iteration of a binary relation

The arithmetic core. Stated over a bare `W → W → Prop` with no frame, no duration type, and no
order, so that it is reusable wherever a step relation appears.
-/

/--
`iter R n` is the `n`-fold composite of the binary relation `R`: `iter R 0` is equality, and
`iter R (n+1)` is `iter R n` followed by one more `R`-step.

The recursion appends the new step on the **right**, which is what makes `iter_add`'s proof a
direct induction on the second summand and matches the `Compositionality`-at-`y = 1` shape used by
`FrameOver.taskRel_natCast_iff_iter`.

Iteration adds: an `(m + n)`-step path factors, at the `m`-th state, into an `m`-step path
followed by an `n`-step path.

This is the whole of *Compositionality* for the normal form — both directions of the paper's
biconditional at once — which is why a frame synthesized from a bare step relation gets its `comp`
field for free.

## The one-step relation and the decomposition theorem
-/

/--
The **one-step relation** of a task frame over ℤ: `step F w u` holds exactly when a task of
duration `1` takes `w` to `u`.

Over ℤ this single relation determines the whole frame — see `taskRel_eq_iter` below — which is
what reduces the semantics of a finite-`WorldState` frame to reachability in a finite directed
graph.

/--
**The decomposition theorem, nonnegative core**: over ℤ, a task of natural-number duration `n` is
exactly an `n`-fold iteration of the one-step relation.

By induction on `n`. The base case is the `nullity_identity` field (`⇒₀` is the identity); the
step case is the `comp` field — the paper's biconditional *Compositionality*
(`def:frame#Compositionality`) — instantiated at `x = n`, `y = 1`, both nonnegative.

/--
**The decomposition theorem**: over ℤ, an arbitrary frame is determined by its one-step
relation, at *every* duration — negative durations included.

The statement is uniform rather than case-split: the two conjuncts are each guarded by a sign
condition, so at a positive `d` the second is vacuous, at a negative `d` the first is, and at
`d = 0` both fire and together say `w = u` (which is exactly `nullity_identity`). The sign split
survives only inside the proof, where the negative half is discharged by the `converse` field
(`def:task-relation`'s converse convention) — the same route the paper uses.

`Int.natAbs` is the right index on both sides because `(-d).natAbs = d.natAbs`: a backward task of
duration `d < 0` is a forward `|d|`-step path traversed in the other direction.

## `H_F` over ℤ is exactly the set of bi-infinite step-paths

`def:world-history` makes a possible world a task-respecting assignment on *all* of `D`, with
an all-pairs obligation. Over ℤ that all-pairs obligation is redundant: adjacency at consecutive
integers implies it, by `taskRel_eq_iter`. This is what makes both the truth lemma and the model
checker tractable — a total history over a finite carrier becomes a bi-infinite walk in a finite
directed graph.

`regionFrame` is deliberately **not** the carrier used here. Its
`not_regionConstant_regionHistory` machine-checks that no history on that carrier ever repeats a
state, which forecloses every lasso argument on it. This presentation exists precisely so that the
downstream periodicity arguments have an obstruction-free carrier.

## Frame synthesis: from a bi-serial one-step relation to a `FrameOver intOrder`

The converse of the decomposition theorem. Six of the seven `FrameOver` fields come for free from
the normal form; the seventh, *Seriality*, is a genuine hypothesis and cannot be dropped.

**Seriality is free from *Occurrence*, never from ℤ.** It is tempting to think finiteness or
discreteness rescues it. They do not: the relation `R w d u := (d = 0)` on `W = Unit` over `D = ℤ`
satisfies `nullity_identity`, *Compositionality*, the converse convention, *Limit*, and
*Saturation*, and fails *Seriality* — on a one-element carrier. `ofStep` therefore takes forward and
backward seriality of `R₁` as hypotheses (`fwd`, `bwd`), and they are exactly bi-seriality of the
one-step relation. Do not attempt to derive them.

**Frame synthesis over ℤ**: a bi-serial relation on a finite nonempty carrier generates a
`FrameOver intOrder`.

The seven field discharges, and where each comes from:

| field | source |
|-------|--------|
| `nonempty` | the `[Nonempty W]` instance |
| `nullity_identity` | free — `iter R₁ 0` *is* `Eq` |
| `comp` | free — `iter_add`, which is the paper's biconditional *Compositionality* whole |
| `converse` | free — `ofStepRel` is symmetric in its two sign-guarded conjuncts by construction |
| `serial` | **the one genuine obligation**: exactly `fwd` and `bwd` (see the section note above) |
| `limit` | `TaskFrame.limit_of_succOrder` — ℤ is a `SuccOrder`, so *Limit* is automatic |
| `saturation` | `TaskFrame.saturation_of_finite` — the carrier is finite |

`saturation_of_finite` is the *only* applicable route here, because `R₁` is arbitrary in shape and
every other `Saturation` helper constrains the relation's shape. It costs `Classical.choice`, and
that cost is accepted for `ofStep` specifically. It is **not** a licence to re-route a frame whose
relation *does* fit a choice-free class helper — see `saturation_of_finite`'s own docstring.

### Worked instances

Two small ℤ frames the results above are exercised on: `staticFrame` (already in the tree) for the
history-space characterization, and `flipFrame` (synthesized here by `ofStep`) for frame synthesis.
`flipFrame` is the two-state cycle — the smallest carrier on which a lasso argument has anything
to bite on — so it is kept as a named definition rather than inlined into an `example`.

/-- `staticFrame W` over ℤ relates a state only to itself, so its step relation is equality and
its bi-infinite step-paths are exactly the constant paths. -/
example (W : Type) [Nonempty W] (w : W) :
    IsStepPath (FrameOver.staticFrame W (D := ℤ)) (fun _ => w) := by
  intro _
  exact (FrameOver.staticFrame_rel_iff W (D := ℤ) w 1 w).mpr rfl

/-- The two-state flip relation on `Bool` is bi-serial, so `ofStep` synthesizes a `FrameOver intOrder`
from it: the canonical two-cycle, and the smallest frame on which a lasso argument has anything
to bite on. -/
def flipFrame : FrameOver intOrder :=
  FrameOver.ofStep (fun w u : Bool => w ≠ u)
    (fun w => ⟨!w, by cases w <;> simp⟩) (fun w => ⟨!w, by cases w <;> simp⟩)

/-- `ofStep` really does recover the relation it was given. -/
example (w u : Bool) :
    (FrameOver.ofStep (fun w u : Bool => w ≠ u)
      (fun w => ⟨!w, by cases w <;> simp⟩) (fun w => ⟨!w, by cases w <;> simp⟩)).step w u
      ↔ w ≠ u :=
  FrameOver.ofStep_step _ _ _ w u

/-- …and the characterization then produces an actual member of `H_F` over that frame. -/
example (W : Type) [Nonempty W] (w : W) :
    ∃ τ : TaskFrame.HF (FrameOver.staticFrame W (D := ℤ)), τ.path = fun _ => w :=
  (FrameOver.mem_HF_iff_adjacent (FrameOver.staticFrame W (D := ℤ)) (fun _ => w)).mpr
    (fun _ => (FrameOver.staticFrame_rel_iff W (D := ℤ) w 1 w).mpr rfl)
