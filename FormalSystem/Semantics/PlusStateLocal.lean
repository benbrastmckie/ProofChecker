# State-locality: the L⁺ fragment whose truth is fixed by the present world state

`PlusFormula.StateLocal` is a syntactic fragment of L⁺
(`FormalSystem/PlusLanguage/Formula.lean`), and `IsPlusStateLocal` is the semantic property it
approximates: at a fixed time `t`, two possible worlds carrying the *same world state at `t`*
agree about `φ`. That is exactly the class `⊡` quantifies over, so a state-local `φ` is already
`⊡`-stable — the headline `φ ↔ ⊡φ` below.

## Main Definitions

- `PlusFormula.StateLocal` — the syntactic fragment, by structural recursion
- `IsPlusStateLocal` — the semantic property: `SameStateAt τ σ t` transfers truth at `t`

## Main Results

- `isPlusStateLocal_box`, `isPlusStateLocal_stab` — `□` and `⊡` are state-local for an
  **arbitrary** argument, which is why the recursion admits them without a recursive hypothesis
- `isPlusStateLocal_of_stateLocal` — soundness of the syntactic fragment against the semantics
- `not_isPlusStateLocal_someFuture`, `not_isPlusStateLocal_somePast` — the two excluded
  constructors are excluded by *theorem*, not by stipulation
- `plusStateLocal_stab_iff` — the headline, pointwise: `φ ↔ ⊡φ` at every point, for state-local
  `φ`
- `plusStateLocal_plusValid_iff_stab` — the headline as a validity
- `stab_of_stateLocal` — the `→` half in argument shape, and the strict generalization of the
  atom-level `p → ⊡p` this tower used to carry

## Which constructors are state-local, and why

Read off `PlusTruthAt` (`Semantics/PlusTruth.lean`) clause by clause, at the **same** evaluation
time on both sides:

| Constructor | State-local? | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `atom p` | yes | `M.valuation (τ.states t ht) p` reads the state at `t` and nothing else |
| `bot` | yes | constant |
| `imp φ ψ` | yes if both are | pointwise |
| `box φ` | yes, for arbitrary `φ` | `∀ σ, σ.IsTotal → …` does not mention `τ` at all |
| `stab φ` | yes, for arbitrary `φ` | the class `⟨τ⟩ₜ` is unchanged by replacing `τ` with any history agreeing at `t` (`stab_congr_sameState`) |
| `untl ψ φ` | no | quantifies over `s > t`, where the two histories may diverge |
| `snce ψ φ` | no | quantifies over `s < t`, likewise |

`box` and `stab` are the two entries a reader is most likely to expect a recursive hypothesis on.
They do not need one: `isPlusStateLocal_box` and `isPlusStateLocal_stab` are proved for an
arbitrary argument, so the fragment is strictly larger than a naive "every subformula is
state-local" reading would give. Both were settled here **by proof**, not by analogy with the L⋆
twin.

## Sound, not complete

`PlusFormula.StateLocal` is a **sufficient** syntactic condition, not a characterization. For
instance `Fp → Fp` is semantically state-local — it is a tautology, so both sides of the
biconditional hold at every point — yet it is syntactically rejected, because `imp` recurses into
two `untl`s and the `untl` clause is `False` unconditionally. Recorded here so the gap reads as a
design choice: the fragment is the one the consumers need, kept small enough that its soundness
proof is a seven-case induction with no side conditions.

The gap runs the other way too, and in the fragment's favour: `⊡Fp` *is* accepted, even though
its subformula `Fp` is not, because the `stab` arm is `True` at an arbitrary argument. Acceptance
turns on the outermost constructor, not on the whole subformula tree.

## The two exclusions live on one frame

`not_isPlusStateLocal_someFuture` and `not_isPlusStateLocal_somePast` are both witnessed on the
permissive frame `NF` over `ℤ` (`Semantics/PlusNonValidities.lean`), where every function `ℤ → ℕ`
is a possible world and `natModel` makes each atom true at world state `0` and nowhere else. No
second countermodel frame is built: two possible worlds agreeing at `0` and disagreeing away from
`0` refute both.

L⁺ has no time registers, so the L⋆ module's third exclusion — `not_isStateLocal_timeRecall` —
has no counterpart here. Two exclusions are all the seven-constructor recursion needs.

## How this fragment relates to the other two shapes of the concept

State-locality had, before this module, three incompatible presentations across the tower. Here
is how each relates to `PlusFormula.StateLocal`, so the tower is systematic rather than merely
parallel.

**1. To the L⋆ fragment, along `ofPlus`.** `stateLocal_ofPlus_iff`
(`Semantics/StateLocalTransfer.lean`) proves `(ofPlus φ).StateLocal ↔ φ.StateLocal` — a
**biconditional**, not merely preservation. `ofPlus` maps the seven L⁺ constructors onto the
seven matching L⋆ ones and the two recursions assign each of them the same arm, so the L⁺
fragment is exactly the `ofPlus`-preimage of the L⋆ fragment. The two L⋆ constructors that have
no L⁺ source, `timeStore` (admitted recursively) and `timeRecall` (excluded), are precisely the
difference between the nine-arm and seven-arm recursions. The transfer lives in its own module,
not here: `Metalogic/Conservativity/Plus/AxiomValidity.lean` imports this one, and an L⋆ import
here would invert the L → L⁺ → L⋆ layering.

**2. To `stab_state_only` (`Semantics/PlusTruth.lean`).** That lemma is a **different-times**
statement: `τ(t) = σ(s)` transfers `⊡φ` from `(τ, t)` to `(σ, s)`, which is what the atomization
route (`Metalogic/Conservativity/Plus/Atomization.lean`) consumes. This module's `stab` arm,
`isPlusStateLocal_stab`, is its **same-time shadow**: one `t` on both sides. The two are related
by `plusTruthAt_timeShift`, and share a common core — `stab_congr_sameState`, which
`stab_state_only` is proved from and which `isPlusStateLocal_stab` is literally an instance of.
The different-times shape does **not** generalize to this fragment: `box φ` at `t` and at `s` can
differ. So the two face opposite ways: `stab_state_only` says `⊡φ` is state-local, this module
says a state-local `φ` is already `⊡`-stable.

**3. To `c_stab_state_only` (`Metalogic/Independence/CoarsenedModels.lean`).** That is the
**coarsened port** of (2), and it is the one relation that is *not* covered by anything here.
`CTruthAt` differs from `PlusTruthAt` in the `stab` clause alone: it quantifies over `SameUnder K`
(agreement of the states' `π`-images) rather than over `SameStateAt` (agreement of the states
themselves), which is strictly weaker. `IsPlusStateLocal` transfers truth along state equality
only, so no instantiation of the results here produces a `CTruthAt` goal, and the coarsened `atom`
case rests on `CoarseModel.atom_inv` — a field of the coarsened model that this fragment has no
access to. A coarsened twin of `isPlusStateLocal_of_stateLocal` is provable (its `atom` arm from
`atom_inv`, its `stab` arm from `c_stab_congr_sameUnder`, its `box` arm from the history-free
clause), but it is a second induction rather than a consequence of this one, and it is not built
here.

**The state-locality fragment of L⁺**, by structural recursion.

`atom`, `bot` and `imp` are the propositional core; `box` and `stab` are admitted for an
arbitrary argument (see `Semantics/PlusStateLocal.lean`'s `isPlusStateLocal_box` and
`isPlusStateLocal_stab`); and `untl`, `snce` are excluded, each with a countermodel in that
module.

/-! ## The semantic property -/

/--
**State-locality, semantically.** `φ` is state-local when, at every frame and model, any two
possible worlds carrying the same world state at `t` agree about `φ` at `t`.

L⁺ has no time registers, so this is `IsStateLocal` (`Semantics/StarStateLocal.lean`) with the
stored-time vector deleted and nothing else changed; the two are arm-for-arm comparable.

The hypotheses could be weakened from `τ.IsTotal`/`σ.IsTotal` to `τ.domain t`/`σ.domain t` —
every proof below uses totality only at `t`, except `plusStateLocal_stab_iff`'s right-to-left
half, which needs `τ ∈ ⟨τ⟩ₜ` and therefore genuinely needs `τ` total. The stronger hypotheses
are kept deliberately, so that this definition and `IsStateLocal` differ in exactly one respect
(the register vector) rather than two.

    ∀ t : F.Duration, SameStateAt τ σ t →
      (PlusTruthAt M τ t φ ↔ PlusTruthAt M σ t φ)

/-! ## `□` and `⊡` are state-local for an arbitrary argument -/

/--
**`□φ` is state-local, whatever `φ` is.** The `box` clause quantifies over *every* total history
and never mentions `τ`, so the two sides are literally the same proposition.

This settles, positively and by proof rather than by analogy with L⋆, the question of whether
`□` belongs in the fragment: it does, and without a hypothesis on `φ`.

state-locality)

theorem isPlusStateLocal_box (φ : PlusFormula) : IsPlusStateLocal (.box φ) :=
  fun _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ => Iff.rfl

/--
**`⊡φ` is state-local, whatever `φ` is.** Discharged from `stab_congr_sameState`
(`Semantics/PlusTruth.lean`), which is exactly this statement at domain hypotheses rather than
totality: the truth of `⊡φ` at `(τ, t)` depends only on the `∼ₜ`-class of `τ`.

That proof dependency is the first of the three relations this module records: the L⁺ fragment's
`stab` arm *is* `stab_congr_sameState`, not a re-derivation of it.

/-! ## Soundness of the syntactic fragment -/

/--
**The soundness theorem.** Every formula in the syntactic fragment has the semantic property.

Seven cases, one per constructor. `box` and `stab` discharge to the two lemmas above with no
inductive hypothesis; `untl` and `snce` are vacuous, the syntactic predicate being `False`
there.

predicate; this is the L⁺ twin of `isStateLocal_of_stateLocal`)

/-! ## The excluded constructors are excluded by theorem

Each witness lives on `NF` with `natModel` (`Semantics/PlusNonValidities.lean`), and each uses a
pair of possible worlds agreeing at time `0` and disagreeing away from it. Both are stated as
negations of `IsPlusStateLocal`, the semantic property: the *syntactic* predicate is `False` on
these constructors by definition, so its negation would be a vacuous claim.

L⁺ has no time registers, so the L⋆ module's third exclusion — `not_isStateLocal_timeRecall` —
does not arise here. Two exclusions are all the seven-constructor recursion needs. -/

/--
**`F φ` is not state-local**, already at an atom. `zeroHist` and `lateHist` agree at time `0` and
differ at every later time, and `natModel` makes `p` true exactly at world state `0`: so `F p`
holds at `(zeroHist, 0)` and fails at `(lateHist, 0)`. This is the `untl` exclusion.

only place the totality of `τ` is used.

**`φ → ⊡φ` for state-local `φ`**, in the pointwise argument shape the consumers use.

This is the **strict generalization** of the atom-level stability lemma the L⁺ tower used to
carry: that lemma was `p → ⊡p` at an atom `p`, and this is `φ → ⊡φ` at every formula the
seven-constructor recursion admits — every Boolean combination of atoms, `□`-formulas and
`⊡`-formulas, at arbitrary arguments under the two modals. `stateLocal_atom p` recovers the atom
instance in one application, which is how `Metalogic/Conservativity/Plus/AxiomValidity.lean`
discharges the `PlusAxiom.atom_stab` arm.

The one hypothesis the atom-restricted statement did not carry is `hτ`: totality is needed for
the right-to-left half of `plusStateLocal_stab_iff` and hence, harmlessly, here. Both consumers
sit inside `PlusValidIn.of_forall_total`, which already binds it.
