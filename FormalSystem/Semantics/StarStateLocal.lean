# State-locality: the L⋆ fragment whose truth is fixed by the present world state

`StarFormula.StateLocal` is a syntactic fragment of L⋆
(`FormalSystem/StarLanguage/Formula.lean`), and `IsStateLocal` is the semantic property it
approximates: at a fixed time `t` and a fixed stored-time vector `v⃗`, two possible worlds
carrying the *same world state at `t`* agree about `φ`. That is exactly the class `⊡` quantifies
over, so a state-local `φ` is already `⊡`-stable — the headline `φ ↔ ⊡φ` below.

## Main Definitions

- `StarFormula.StateLocal` — the syntactic fragment, by structural recursion
- `IsStateLocal` — the semantic property: `SameStateAt τ σ t` transfers truth at `(t, v⃗)`

## Main Results

- `isStateLocal_box`, `isStateLocal_stab` — `□` and `⊡` are state-local for an **arbitrary**
  argument, which is why the recursion admits them without a recursive hypothesis
- `isStateLocal_of_stateLocal` — soundness of the syntactic fragment against the semantics
- `not_isStateLocal_someFuture`, `not_isStateLocal_somePast`, `not_isStateLocal_timeRecall` —
  the three excluded constructors are excluded by *theorem*, not by stipulation
- `stateLocal_stab_iff` — the headline, pointwise: `φ ↔ ⊡φ` at every point, for state-local `φ`
- `stateLocal_starValid_iff_stab` — the headline as a validity

## Which constructors are state-local, and why

Read off `StarTruthAt` (`Semantics/StarTruth.lean`) clause by clause, at the **same** evaluation
time and the **same** register vector on both sides:

| Constructor | State-local? | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `atom p` | yes | `M.valuation (τ.states t ht) p` reads the state at `t` and nothing else |
| `bot` | yes | constant |
| `imp φ ψ` | yes if both are | pointwise |
| `box φ` | yes, for arbitrary `φ` | `∀ σ, σ.IsTotal → …` does not mention `τ` at all |
| `stab φ` | yes, for arbitrary `φ` | the class `⟨τ⟩ₜ` is unchanged by replacing `τ` with any history agreeing at `t` (`sameStateAt_congr_left`) |
| `untl ψ φ` | no | quantifies over `s > t`, where the two histories may diverge |
| `snce ψ φ` | no | quantifies over `s < t`, likewise |
| `timeStore i φ` | yes if `φ` is | evaluation stays at `t`, and both sides write the same `t` |
| `timeRecall i φ` | no | moves evaluation to `vᵢ`, which the hypothesis at `t` does not constrain |

`box` and `stab` are the two entries a reader is most likely to expect a recursive hypothesis on.
They do not need one: `isStateLocal_box` and `isStateLocal_stab` are proved for an arbitrary
argument, so the fragment is strictly larger than a naive "every subformula is state-local"
reading would give.

## Same-time, not different-times

`stab_state_only` (`Semantics/PlusTruth.lean`) is a **different-times** statement: `τ(t) = σ(s)`
transfers `⊡φ` from `(τ, t)` to `(σ, s)`. That shape does **not** generalize to this fragment —
`box φ` at `t` and at `s` can differ, and `timeStore i` writes a different time into the register
on each side. The same-time shape used here (one `t`, one `v⃗`) is both provable for the fragment
and exactly what the consumer needs: `settledDisj_iff` (`Semantics/StarValidity.lean`) evaluates
`φ` at the *single* time held in register `2`.

So this module is the companion facing the other way to `stab_state_only`: that lemma says `⊡φ`
is state-local, this one says a state-local `φ` is already `⊡`-stable.

## Sound, not complete

`StarFormula.StateLocal` is a **sufficient** syntactic condition, not a characterization. For
instance `↑ⁱ↓ⁱφ` is semantically state-local whenever `φ` is — the store immediately preceding
the recall returns evaluation to the present time — yet it is syntactically rejected, because the
`timeRecall` clause is `False` unconditionally. Recorded here so the gap reads as a design
choice: the fragment is the one the consumers need, kept small enough that its soundness proof is
a nine-case induction with no side conditions.

## The three exclusions live on one frame

`not_isStateLocal_someFuture`, `not_isStateLocal_somePast` and `not_isStateLocal_timeRecall` are
all witnessed on the permissive frame `NF` over `ℤ` (`Semantics/PlusNonValidities.lean`), where
every function `ℤ → ℕ` is a possible world and `natModel` makes each atom true at world state `0`
and nowhere else. No second countermodel frame is built: two possible worlds agreeing at `0` and
disagreeing away from `0` refute all three.

**The state-locality fragment of L⋆**, by structural recursion.

`atom`, `bot` and `imp` are the propositional core; `box` and `stab` are admitted for an
arbitrary argument (see `Semantics/StarStateLocal.lean`'s `isStateLocal_box` and
`isStateLocal_stab`); `timeStore` is admitted recursively, since it does not move the evaluation
time; and `untl`, `snce`, `timeRecall` are excluded, each with a countermodel in that module.

Sufficient, not necessary — see the module docstring's "Sound, not complete".

/-! ## The semantic property -/

/--
**State-locality, semantically.** `φ` is state-local when, at every frame and model, any two
possible worlds carrying the same world state at `t` agree about `φ` at `t` — under the *same*
stored-time vector on both sides.

The register vector is quantified inside, not fixed outside, so that the `timeStore` case of
`isStateLocal_of_stateLocal` can instantiate its inductive hypothesis at the updated vector.
-/
def IsStateLocal (φ : StarFormula) : Prop :=
  ∀ (F : TaskFrame) (M : TaskModel F) (τ σ : ConvexHistory F), τ.IsTotal → σ.IsTotal →
    ∀ (t : F.Duration) (v : ℕ → F.Duration), SameStateAt τ σ t →
      (StarTruthAt M τ t v φ ↔ StarTruthAt M σ t v φ)

/-! ## `□` and `⊡` are state-local for an arbitrary argument -/

/--
**`□φ` is state-local, whatever `φ` is.** The `box` clause quantifies over *every* total history
and never mentions `τ`, so the two sides are literally the same proposition.

This settles, positively, the question of whether `□` belongs in the fragment: it does, and
without a hypothesis on `φ`.

theorem isStateLocal_box (φ : StarFormula) : IsStateLocal (.box φ) :=
  fun _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ => Iff.rfl

/--
**`⊡φ` is state-local, whatever `φ` is.** The `stab` clause quantifies over the histories in
`⟨τ⟩ₜ`, and `sameStateAt_congr_left` says that class is unchanged when `τ` is replaced by any
history carrying the same state at `t`.

    exact hh ρ hρ ((hclass ρ).mpr hs)
  · intro hh ρ hρ hs
    exact hh ρ hρ ((hclass ρ).mp hs)

/-! ## Soundness of the syntactic fragment -/

/--
**The soundness theorem.** Every formula in the syntactic fragment has the semantic property.

Nine cases, one per constructor. `box` and `stab` discharge to the two lemmas above with no
inductive hypothesis; `untl`, `snce` and `timeRecall` are vacuous, the syntactic predicate being
`False` there; `timeStore` uses its inductive hypothesis at the *updated* register vector, which
is why `IsStateLocal` quantifies the vector internally.

/-! ## The excluded constructors are excluded by theorem

Each witness lives on `NF` with `natModel`, and each uses a pair of possible worlds agreeing at
time `0` and disagreeing away from it. All three are stated as negations of `IsStateLocal`, the
semantic property: the *syntactic* predicate is `False` on these constructors by definition, so
its negation would be a vacuous claim. -/

**`F φ` is not state-local**, already at an atom. `zeroHist` and `lateHist` agree at time `0` and
differ at every later time, and `natModel` makes `p` true exactly at world state `0`: so `F p`
holds at `(zeroHist, 0)` and fails at `(lateHist, 0)`. This is the `untl` exclusion.

Left to right is `isStateLocal_of_stateLocal`: every `σ ∈ ⟨τ⟩ₜ` agrees with `τ` about `φ`. Right

place the totality of `τ` is used.
