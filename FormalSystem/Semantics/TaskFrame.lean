# TaskFrame — the frame fibration: `TemporalOrder`, `FrameOver`, and the total space

This module defines task frames, the fundamental semantic structures for bimodal logic TM.

## The fibration

`def:frame` reads a frame as `𝔉 = ⟨W, 𝔇, ⇒⟩`: a nonempty set of world states, **a temporal
order**, and a task relation. The temporal order is a *component*, on the same footing as the
other two. This module encodes that as a fibration, in three declarations:

| Lean | Paper | Role |
|------|-------|------|
| `TemporalOrder` (`Semantics/TemporalOrder.lean`) | `def:temporal-order` | the object `𝔇` — "a nontrivial totally ordered abelian group", reified |
| `FrameOver D` | frames at a fixed `𝔇` | the **fibre**; the sole declaration site of the six frame fields |
| `TaskFrame` | `𝔉 = ⟨W, 𝔇, ⇒⟩` | the **total space**, `Σ (D : TemporalOrder), FrameOver D` |

`FrameOver.toTaskFrame` is the inclusion of a fibre into the total space, and it is literally the
constructor: `⟨D, F⟩`. Structure eta makes the projection an identity rather than an isomorphism
up to transport — `⟨G.Duration, G.toFibre⟩ = G`, `(F.toTaskFrame).toFibre = F` and
`(F.toTaskFrame).Duration = D` all hold by `rfl`, pinned as `example`s at the end of this module.
`instCoeOutFrameOver` lets a fibre value be handed to `ConvexHistory`, `TaskModel` and `TruthAt`,
which are stated over the total space.

**Why a component and not a type parameter.** A property of the temporal order alone cannot be
*predicated of a frame* while the order is an index; it can only be quantified at the carrier.
With `Duration` a field, `def:frame-properties`' Discrete / Dense / Complete are ordinary
predicates on a `TaskFrame`, through its `Duration` component, exactly as the paper states them.
Conversely the fibre is what makes "the frames over a fixed temporal order" sayable at all — a
propositional carrier equation cannot carry it, because the equation is a `Prop` while
`OfNat F.Duration 1` is data, so no numeral elaborates under it. `FrameOver intOrder` has both:
numerals elaborate, and the order is fixed.

`TaskFrame`'s flat surface is preserved: `F.WorldState`, `F.TaskRel`, `F.saturation` and the rest
are delegating accessors on the total space, `@[reducible]` where the value is data and
`theorem`s where it is a `Prop` (Lean refuses `@[reducible]` on a proof; proof irrelevance makes
that costless).

Where a frame's duration carrier is pinned to a bare `Type` by a neighbouring abstraction this
module does not own — `BFMCS` in the bundle layer, `FrameConditionFor` and `TemporalCarrier` in
the decidability bridge — the frame is written `FrameOver (TemporalOrder.of D)`. That is the
same fibre, named through `TemporalOrder.of`, and it is why that constructor is permanent.

## Paper Specification Reference

**Task Frames (`def:frame`)**:
The JPL paper "The Perpetuity Calculus of Agency" defines a frame (verbatim: "A \textit{frame}
is any $\F = \tuple{W, \D, \Rightarrow}$ where $W$ is a nonempty set of world states, $\D$ is
a temporal order, and $\Rightarrow$ is a task relation satisfying the following for
$x, y \geq 0$") with exactly FOUR axioms:
- *Compositionality* (`def:frame#Compositionality`, verbatim): "$w \Rightarrow_{x + y} v$ if
  and only if $w \Rightarrow_x u$ and $u \Rightarrow_y v$ for some $u \in W$." — a
  BICONDITIONAL: right-to-left is composition, left-to-right is interpolation, and both
  directions are load-bearing.
- *Seriality* (`def:frame#Seriality`, verbatim): "$w \Rightarrow_x u$ and $v \Rightarrow_x w$
  for some $u, v \in W$."
- *Limit* (`def:frame#Limit`, verbatim): "$\bigcap\limits_{x > 0} (w)_x = \set{w}$."
- *Saturation* (`def:frame#Saturation`, verbatim): "$\bigcap \mathcal{S} \neq \emptyset$ for any
  $\supseteq$-directed family $\mathcal{S}$ of nonempty fibers and segments."

Nullity is NOT an axiom. The paper's `lem:nullity` (verbatim: "$w \Rightarrow_0 w$ for every
world state $w \in W$ in every task frame $\F = \tuple{W, \D, \Rightarrow}$.") is DERIVED,
choice-free, from *Seriality* at `x = 0` plus *Limit*, and asserts reflexivity only.

The supporting apparatus — nonempty `W`, the positive-cone primitive relation, the converse
convention, fiber, cone, and segment (`def:task-relation`), and the `⊇`-directed family
(`def:frame`'s opening clause; formerly the standalone `def:directed`, which the paper's 2026-09
wave inlined into `def:frame` and deleted — recorded `DANGLING` in
`specs/paper-definitions-of-record.md`) — is transcribed in this module's "Fiber, cone, segment,
and directed-family apparatus" section. The temporal order is `def:temporal-order` (verbatim: "A \textit{temporal
order} is a nontrivial totally ordered abelian group $\D = \tuple{D, +, 0, \leq}$ with
\textit{positive cone} $D^+ \coloneq \set{x \in D : x \geq 0}$.").

**ProofChecker Implementation**:
This implementation generalizes the time group to any type `D` with an
ordered additive commutative group structure, which provides:
- Additive abelian group structure (zero, addition, inverse)
- Total linear order (≤ relation)
- Order compatibility with addition

This allows for various temporal structures:
- `Int`: Discrete integer time (standard temporal logic)
- `Rat`: Dense rational time (for fine-grained temporal reasoning)
- `Real`: Continuous real time (for physical systems)
- Custom bounded or modular time structures

**Alignment status relative to the four-axiom `def:frame`**:
- The two-sided `TaskRel` together with the `converse` field **is** the paper's extended
  relation over a primitive relation living on the positive cone. `converse` packages
  `def:task-relation`'s definitional converse convention as structure data; it is not an extra
  temporal-symmetry axiom.
- `comp` **is** the paper's biconditional *Compositionality*, carried whole. Its `←`
  (composition) half is projected back out as the derived `forward_comp`, whose statement is
  unchanged from when it was a field; its `→` (interpolation) half is projected out as
  `interpolates`, definitionally `Interpolates TaskRel`.
- `serial`, `limit`, and `saturation` carry the paper's other three axioms, each stated by
  citation of the corresponding bare-relation predicate (or, for *Limit*, its literal
  transcribed shape) rather than restated inline.
- `nullity_identity` is an iff, strictly STRONGER than the paper's derived `lem:nullity`
  (reflexivity only). Its final form is an open design question — see the field's docstring.
- Reflection (`nullity`) and backward composition (`backward_comp`) are **derived** here,
  matching `lem:nullity`'s derived status in the paper.
- Mixed-sign composition is not so much prohibited as **inexpressible at the primitive level**,
  since primitive durations are nonnegative.
- The ordered additive group structure provides the required abelian group with total order.

**Known gaps relative to the paper**: none of the structural ones remain. The two that stood
here are now closed, and are recorded as closed rather than deleted, since both were long-lived:

- `W` nonempty (`def:frame`, verbatim: "$W$ is a nonempty set of world states";
  `def:task-relation`) is the `nonempty` field, discharged at every frame in the tree. Its
  immediate payoff is that `TaskFrame.not_validOn_bot` (Semantics/Validity.lean) is now the bare
  `¬ F.ValidOn ⊥`, with no world state taken as an argument.
- `D` nontrivial (`def:temporal-order`) is `[Nontrivial D]`, now among the structure's own
  binders and inherited by `FiniteFrameOver`. `Valid` and `SemanticConsequence`
  (Semantics/Validity.lean) already carried it and still do — they bind `D` themselves, so
  theirs is not made redundant by the structure's; what the structure's binder removes is the
  possibility of writing a frame over a trivial duration order at all.

All four of `def:frame`'s axioms are now carried by the structure, so the former entries here
for *Seriality*, *Limit*, *Saturation*, and the interpolation direction of *Compositionality*
are retired rather than restated: they are the `serial`, `limit`, `saturation`, and `comp`
fields. The apparatus that makes *Saturation* statable — `Fib`, `cone`, `Seg`,
`DirectedFamily`, `IsFiber`, `IsSegment` — is defined below the module header and above the
structure, and is consumed by it. *Limit*'s transcription against the extended relation is
`∀ w u, (∀ x, 0 < x → ∃ y, |y| < x ∧ TaskRel w y u) → u = w`; the `⊇` half of the paper's
equality is `nullity` plus cone membership and needs no field, and the two reusable discharge
routes are `limit_of_succOrder` and `limit_of_shift` below.

## Main Definitions

- `FrameOver D`: the fibre over a temporal order — world states, task relation, and the six
  frame axioms; the sole declaration site of the axioms
- `TaskFrame`: the total space, `Σ (D : TemporalOrder), FrameOver D`, with `Duration` and
  `toFibre` as its two fields
- `FrameOver.nullity_identity`: Zero duration iff identity (`TaskRel w 0 u ↔ w = u`) —
  stronger than the paper's derived `lem:nullity`; open design question, see its docstring
- `FrameOver.comp`: the paper's biconditional *Compositionality* (`0 ≤ x`, `0 ≤ y`), stated as
  `TaskFrame.Compositional TaskRel`
- `FrameOver.serial`, `FrameOver.limit`, `FrameOver.saturation`: *Seriality*, *Limit*, and
  *Saturation*, stated as `TaskFrame.Serial TaskRel`, *Limit*'s literal transcribed shape, and
  `TaskFrame.Saturation TaskRel`
- `FrameOver.forward_comp`: the `←` (composition) half of `comp`, derived; its statement is
  verbatim that of the former field of the same name
- `FrameOver.interpolates`: the `→` (interpolation) half of `comp`, derived, definitionally
  `TaskFrame.Interpolates TaskRel`
- `FrameOver.converse`: The definitional converse convention (`TaskRel w d u ↔ TaskRel u (-d) w`)
- `FrameOver.nullity`: Derived reflexivity theorem (`TaskRel w 0 w`, matching `lem:nullity`)
- `TaskFrame.Fib`, `TaskFrame.cone`, `TaskFrame.Seg`, `TaskFrame.DirectedFamily`,
  `TaskFrame.IsFiber`, `TaskFrame.IsSegment`: the `def:task-relation` / `⊇`-directed
  apparatus over a bare relation
- `TaskFrame.Saturation`, `TaskFrame.Serial`, `TaskFrame.Interpolates`,
  `TaskFrame.Compositional`: `def:frame`'s axioms as predicates over a bare relation, hosted
  above the structure so that its fields cite them *definitionally* (a field's type may only
  mention earlier declarations). *Limit* is deliberately unnamed and used in its literal
  transcribed shape

## Main Results

- `TaskFrame.limit_of_succOrder`: *Limit* is automatic over a discrete duration
  type (`[SuccOrder D] [NoMaxOrder D]`)
- `TaskFrame.limit_of_shift`: *Limit* is automatic for deterministic-shift frames
  over any nontrivial duration type, dense included
- `TaskFrame.exists_uniform_radius_of_finite`: on a finite carrier, *Limit* upgrades to a
  uniform positive radius around each state
- Example task frames for testing and demonstrations (polymorphic over time type)

## Implementation Notes

- `(D : TemporalOrder)` is one binder, not a carrier plus four algebraic instance binders; the
  four `def:temporal-order` components are `D`'s own fields, re-exported as instances, so `↑D`
  carries them with no ceremony
- Task relation `TaskRel w x u` means: world state `u` is reachable from `w` by task
  of duration `x`
- Nullity: zero-duration task is identity, stated as an iff (open design question against the
  paper's reflexivity-only `lem:nullity`)
- Compositionality is carried whole, as the paper's biconditional on the positive cone; its two
  halves are the derived `FrameOver.forward_comp` and `FrameOver.interpolates`
- Genuine side conditions on the carrier — `[SuccOrder ↑D]`, `[DenselyOrdered ↑D]`,
  `[Archimedean ↑D]` — remain ordinary instance binders. Only `def:temporal-order`'s own four
  components stopped being binders
- `omega` reads the *syntactic* type of a hypothesis and does not see through the `TemporalOrder`
  carrier coercion, so arithmetic-carrying binders at the `ℤ` fibre are written `(d : ℤ)`, and
  where a hypothesis is produced by a frame field's own type the recovery form is an explicit
  restatement (`@LT.lt ℤ _ a b`), never a `▸` cast

## The `def:frame` apparatus and axiom predicates

The fiber/cone/segment/directed-family apparatus and three of `def:frame`'s four axioms are
declared **before** the frame structure, not after it. That ordering is load bearing: a
structure field's type may only mention declarations that precede it, so these are the
declarations the structure's axiom fields are stated from. Everything here is over a bare
relation `R : W → D → W → Prop`, so nothing in this block depends on the structure.

### Fiber, cone, segment, and directed-family apparatus

The supporting apparatus of the paper's frame definition (`def:frame`), stated — like the Limit
discharge helpers above — against a bare relation `R : W → D → W → Prop` rather than a
`FrameOver` field, so the definitions apply verbatim to a frame's `TaskRel` whether or not the
corresponding axioms are carried as structure data. This apparatus is what makes the paper's
*Saturation* axiom ("`⋂ 𝒮 ≠ ∅` for any `⊇`-directed family `𝒮` of nonempty fibers and segments")
statable at all.

Recorded source, `def:task-relation` (verbatim):
- *Fiber:* `\Fib(w, x) \coloneq \set{u \in W : w \Rightarrow_x u}`.
- *Cone:* `(w)_x \coloneq \bigcup\limits_{\vert{y} < x} \Fib(w, y)` where `x > 0`.
- *Segment:* `[w, v]_x^y \coloneq \Fib(w, x) \cap \Fib(v, -y)` where `x, y \geq 0`.

Recorded source, `def:frame`'s opening clause (verbatim): "Letting a nonempty family of sets
$\mathcal{S}$ be \textit{$\supseteq$-directed} just in case $S \subseteq S_1 \cap S_2$ for some
$S \in \mathcal{S}$ whenever $S_1, S_2 \in \mathcal{S}$". (Formerly the standalone
`def:directed`; see `DirectedFamily`'s docstring for the retirement.)

Fibers and segments are TWO separate classes of sets (`IsFiber`, `IsSegment`): a one-sided
fiber does not count as a segment, and a "fibers and segments" hypothesis is always the
disjunction `IsFiber s ∨ IsSegment s`, never a single merged class.

Fiber of `w` at duration `x` under the relation `R`.

Recorded source (`def:task-relation`, *Fiber* clause, verbatim):
"`\Fib(w, x) \coloneq \set{u \in W : w \Rightarrow_x u}`."

`Fib R w x` is the set of states reachable from `w` by a task of duration exactly `x`; by the
converse convention, negative-duration fibers run the relation backwards. The paper defines
fibers for every duration `x ∈ D`, so no sign proviso is carried here.

Cone of radius `x` around `w` under the relation `R`.

Recorded source (`def:task-relation`, *Cone* clause, verbatim):
"`(w)_x \coloneq \bigcup\limits_{\vert{y} < x} \Fib(w, y)` where `x > 0`."

The paper's proviso `x > 0` is carried at use sites rather than in the type: for `x ≤ 0` no
duration `y` satisfies `|y| < x`, so the cone is empty and the definition is harmless outside
the intended domain. Membership `u ∈ cone R w x` unfolds to exactly the witness shape the Limit
discharge helpers above consume (`∃ y, |y| < x ∧ R w y u`), so the paper's *Limit* axiom
`⋂_{x > 0} (w)_x = {w}` transcribes as
`∀ w u, (∀ x, 0 < x → u ∈ cone R w x) → u = w` (the `⊇` half being reflexivity plus cone
membership at every radius).

Segment between `w` and `v` at forward offset `x` and backward offset `y`, written `[w, v]_x^y`

Recorded source (`def:task-relation`, *Segment* clause, verbatim):
"`[w, v]_x^y \coloneq \Fib(w, x) \cap \Fib(v, -y)` where `x, y \geq 0`."

The bracket form is the notation of record; the paper's retired `\Seg` function-application
notation is deleted from its preamble and must not be reintroduced. The proviso `x, y ≥ 0` is
carried by `IsSegment` below rather than in this definition's type.

A `⊇`-directed family of sets.

Recorded source (`def:frame`'s opening clause, verbatim): "Letting a nonempty family of sets
$\mathcal{S}$ be \textit{$\supseteq$-directed} just in case $S \subseteq S_1 \cap S_2$ for some
$S \in \mathcal{S}$ whenever $S_1, S_2 \in \mathcal{S}$".

**The anchor moved twice, and the current shape is the third.** The condition itself has never
changed; its home in the paper has. It was first a standalone `def:directed` stating an
undifferentiated "\textit{directed}"; then that definition split into a `$\supseteq$-Directed`
and a `$\subseteq$-Directed` clause, of which *Saturation* consumes only the `$\supseteq$` one;
then the paper's 2026-09 wave deleted `def:directed` outright, dropped the `$\subseteq$` half
entirely, and inlined the `$\supseteq$` half into `def:frame`'s opening clause — which is what is
quoted above. `def:directed` is recorded `DANGLING` in
`specs/paper-definitions-of-record.md`; do not cite it as a live anchor, and do not reintroduce
the unqualified word "directed", which was ambiguous even before the split.

The nonemptiness of the family is part of the definition (it comes from "a nonempty family of
sets"); the nonemptiness of its *members* is a separate hypothesis wherever
*Saturation*-shaped statements need it.

`s` is a fiber of the relation `R`: one of the two separate classes of sets the *Saturation*

classes of sets the *Saturation* axiom (`def:frame`) ranges over. A one-sided fiber does not
count as a segment — the two classes are kept separate, and a "fibers and segments" hypothesis
is the disjunction `IsFiber R s ∨ IsSegment R s`.

## The frame axioms in bare-relation form

`def:frame`'s four axioms, stated as `Prop`-valued predicates over a bare task relation
`R : W → D → W → Prop`. Three of them live here — *Saturation*, *Seriality*, and the
interpolation half of *Compositionality*; *Limit* is deliberately left unnamed and used in its
literal transcribed shape (see the discharge helpers `limit_of_succOrder` and `limit_of_shift`
above).

**These predicates are the sole form in which the axioms are available.** Where the `FrameOver`
structure carries the corresponding fields, `FrameOver.saturation` must be *definitionally*
`Saturation TaskRel`, `FrameOver.serial` definitionally `Serial TaskRel`, and the interpolation
half of biconditional *Compositionality* definitionally `Interpolates TaskRel`, **all as defined
here**. Discharging a downstream hypothesis is then a mechanical substitution (`F.saturation`,
`F.serial`, `F.interpolates`) with zero restatement. If a field lands whose statement differs,
the results that consume these predicates stop typechecking — and that compilation failure *is*
the acceptance test. That invariant is recorded in
`specs/decisions/total-history-validity-decisions.md` (the four-axiom frame-alignment decision).

*Saturation* in particular must be literally the hypothesis the Step Lemma's proof consumes at the
sole application site the paper names, never an inert structure field.

They are hosted in this module, rather than beside `Constraints` in `FrameAxioms.lean`, for a
structural reason: a structure field's type may only mention declarations that precede it, so a
predicate declared in a module that *imports* this one could never become a `FrameOver` field.
-/

/--
The *Saturation* axiom, over a bare task relation.

Recorded source (`def:frame#Saturation`, verbatim): "$\bigcap \mathcal{S} \neq \emptyset$ for any
$\supseteq$-directed family $\mathcal{S}$ of nonempty fibers and segments."

**Where this sits in the ball-space hierarchy.** The paper attaches a footnote to this axiom
(quoted from `def:frame`): the nonempty fibers and segments form a *ball space* on `W` in the
sense of Ćmiel, Kuhlmann and Kuhlmann, and *Saturation* is the **downward-directed-intersection
condition $\mathbf{S}_1^d$** of that hierarchy — "the nest condition $\mathbf{S}_1$ with a
$\supseteq$-directed system of balls in place of a nest". The footnote concludes that it is
therefore **at least as strong as** the standard *spherically complete* condition, which is
$\mathbf{S}_1$ itself. The name "Saturation" is not a synonym for "spherically complete"; reading
it as one understates the axiom. (Note the paper's 2026-09 wave *withdrew* the strictness claim:
the footnote used to read "strictly stronger", and now reads "at least as strong as". The
implication $\mathbf{S}_1^d \Rightarrow \mathbf{S}_1$ is still asserted; the converse is no
longer denied. Do not restore "strictly stronger" here.)

Three points of the transcription, each load bearing:

1. *Directed* is `def:frame`'s own opening clause, transcribed as `DirectedFamily`: "$S \subseteq
   S_1 \cap S_2$ for some $S \in \mathcal{S}$ whenever $S_1, S_2 \in \mathcal{S}$", which already
   carries the nonemptiness of the family `S`. It was a standalone `def:directed` until the
   paper's 2026-09 wave inlined it here and deleted the label; see `DirectedFamily`'s docstring.
2. "Nonempty fibers and segments" is a condition on each *member*: it is both a class condition
   (`IsFiber R s ∨ IsSegment R s`) and a nonemptiness condition (`s.Nonempty`). Fibers and
   segments are **two separate classes**; a one-sided fiber does not count as a segment.
3. "$\bigcap \mathcal{S} \neq \emptyset$" is `(⋂₀ S).Nonempty`.

This predicate is the sole form in which *Saturation* is available: it is what the Step Lemma's
proof consumes at the one application site the paper names, and what the `FrameOver`
saturation field is definitionally equal to.

**Unrelated to tableau saturation.** `FormalSystem/Metalogic/Decidability/Saturation.lean` uses
"saturation" in the proof-theoretic sense — closure of a tableau branch under its expansion
rules. That module declares no `Saturation` namespace, so the two names never collide; the
overlap is terminological only.

The *Seriality* axiom, over a bare task relation.

Recorded source (`def:frame#Seriality`, verbatim): "$w \Rightarrow_x u$ and $v \Rightarrow_x w$
for some $u, v \in W$."

The `0 ≤ x` proviso is `def:frame`'s own blanket condition on its axiom list (verbatim: "a task
relation satisfying the following for $x, y \geq 0$"), carried here as an explicit hypothesis
rather than in the type. Both conjuncts are stated: every state has an `x`-successor *and* an
`x`-predecessor.
-/
def Serial {W : Type} (R : W → D → W → Prop) : Prop :=
  ∀ (w : W) (x : D), 0 ≤ x → (∃ u, R w x u) ∧ (∃ v, R v x w)

/--
The interpolation half of *Compositionality*, over a bare task relation.

Recorded source (`def:frame#Compositionality`, verbatim): "$w \Rightarrow_{x + y} v$ if and only
if $w \Rightarrow_x u$ and $u \Rightarrow_y v$ for some $u \in W$."

*Compositionality* is a **biconditional**, and both directions are load bearing. The
right-to-left direction — composition — is already the existing structure field
`FrameOver.forward_comp`. This definition is the missing left-to-right direction: a task of
duration `x + y` can be *interpolated* at every intermediate point. The full biconditional axiom
is therefore `forward_comp ∧ Interpolates`.

As with `Serial`, the `0 ≤ x`, `0 ≤ y` provisos are `def:frame`'s blanket condition on its axiom
list, carried as explicit hypotheses.
-/
def Interpolates {W : Type} (R : W → D → W → Prop) : Prop :=
  ∀ w v x y, 0 ≤ x → 0 ≤ y → R w (x + y) v → ∃ u, R w x u ∧ R u y v

/--
The *Compositionality* axiom in full, over a bare task relation.

Recorded source (`def:frame#Compositionality`, verbatim): "$w \Rightarrow_{x + y} v$ if and only
if $w \Rightarrow_x u$ and $u \Rightarrow_y v$ for some $u \in W$."

This is the **biconditional**, both of whose directions are load bearing. It is the paper's axiom
itself rather than either half: unfolded, it is

```
∀ w v x y, 0 ≤ x → 0 ≤ y → (R w (x + y) v ↔ ∃ u, R w x u ∧ R u y v)
```

and its two halves are `Interpolates R` (the `→` direction, above) and the composition law that
`FrameOver.forward_comp` records (the `←` direction). Naming the conjunction as a predicate — in
the same style as `Serial` and `Saturation` — is what lets the `FrameOver` `comp` field be stated
by *citation* rather than by restating the shape inline, and lets `comp_of` assemble it from the
two halves without higher-order unification against an applied relation.

The `0 ≤ x`, `0 ≤ y` provisos are `def:frame`'s blanket condition on its axiom list.

**The fibre of the frame fibration**: task frames over a *fixed* temporal order `D`.

`FrameOver D` is the sole declaration site of the frame axioms in this development. The total
space `TaskFrame` below is `Σ (D : TemporalOrder), FrameOver D` — it *has* a `FrameOver` rather
than restating one — so every axiom exists exactly once and the inclusion of a fibre into the
total space is the constructor `⟨D, F⟩`, not a transport.

A frame over `D` consists of:
- a type of world states,
- a task relation connecting world states via timed tasks of duration `x : ↑D`,
- nullity identity: a zero-duration task is the identity (`w = u`),
- compositionality: tasks compose, and interpolate, on the positive cone,
- the converse convention, `TaskRel w d u ↔ TaskRel u (-d) w`,
- seriality, limit and saturation.

The task relation `TaskRel w x u` means: starting from world state `w`, executing a task of
duration `x` can result in world state `u`.

**Why the fibre is primitive.** "The task frames over a fixed duration type" is how the entire ℤ
layer of this development is stated, and it is not expressible against a frame that carries its
duration as an opaque field: `(F : TaskFrame) (h : F.Duration = ℤ)` cannot supply
`OfNat F.Duration 1`, because `h` is a `Prop` and the numeral is data. Indexing by a
`TemporalOrder` says the same thing with the numerals intact.

**Paper Alignment**: The paper's `def:frame` carries exactly FOUR axioms — *Compositionality*
(a biconditional), *Seriality*, *Limit*, *Saturation* — and no Nullity axiom (`lem:nullity` is
derived, reflexivity only). This structure carries **all four**, as `comp`, `serial`, `limit`,
and `saturation`, each by citation of a bare-relation predicate rather than by inline
restatement. It additionally carries the converse convention (`converse`) and an iff-form
zero-duration law (`nullity_identity`) that is strictly stronger than the paper's derived
`lem:nullity`. What remains absent is structural rather than axiomatic — see the module
docstring's "Known gaps" list.

**Axiomatization Notes**:
The paper's own presentation (`def:task-relation`) takes the primitive task relation to live on
the positive cone `D⁺ = {x : 0 ≤ x}` and extends it to negative durations by the converse
convention. This structure is that presentation: the two-sided `TaskRel` is the *extended*
relation, `converse` is the convention that defines it from the primitive one, and
`forward_comp`'s `0 ≤ x`, `0 ≤ y` hypotheses confine composition to the primitive domain.

The paper's *Compositionality* (`def:frame#Compositionality`, verbatim: "$w \Rightarrow_{x + y}
v$ if and only if $w \Rightarrow_x u$ and $u \Rightarrow_y v$ for some $u \in W$") is a
BICONDITIONAL, and the `comp` field carries it whole: its right-to-left (composition) direction
is projected out as `forward_comp` and its left-to-right (interpolation) direction as
`interpolates`.

*Reflection* and backward composition are derived rather than postulated here (`nullity`,
`backward_comp`), matching `lem:nullity`'s derived status in the paper, and mixed-sign
composition is not prohibited but inexpressible at the primitive level, since primitive
durations are nonnegative.

  **The world-state type is nonempty.**

  `def:temporal-order` and `def:task-relation` both read `W` as a nonempty set of world states:
  *Seriality* quantifies existentially over `W` at every duration, and `cor:occurrence` builds a
  total history through a *given* world state. A frame with an empty carrier satisfies every one
  of the four axioms vacuously while validating `⊥`, which is exactly what
  `Semantics/Validity.lean`'s `not_validOn_bot` has to rule out — it did so by taking a
  world state as an extra argument precisely because this field was absent.

  Carried as a field rather than as an instance binder on the structure: instance binders on
  `FrameOver` would have to be supplied at every mention of the type, whereas a field is
  discharged once per frame at its construction site and read off as `F.worldNonempty`
  thereafter. It is instance-implicit and re-exported below, so `Nonempty F.WorldState` is
  also available to synthesis.

  /-- Task relation: `TaskRel w x u` means u is reachable from w by task of duration x -/
  TaskRel : WorldState → D → WorldState → Prop
  /--
  Nullity identity constraint: zero-duration task relates exactly identical states.

  For any world states `w` and `u`, `TaskRel w 0 u` holds iff `w = u`.
  This is stronger than just reflexivity: it says zero duration means no change.

  **Not a strengthening — this field is DERIVABLE, and the frame class is extensionally
  exactly the paper's.** An earlier revision of this docstring called the field "strictly
  stronger than the paper" and left the keep-or-demote choice open as a design question. That
  was wrong on the mathematics. Both halves of the `↔` follow from the other fields:

  * **Reflexivity** (`w = u → TaskRel w 0 u`) is `lem:nullity`, derived choice-free from
    *Seriality* at `x = 0` plus *Limit*. It is already proved in this tree as
    `TaskFrame.nullity_of_serial_limit` (`Semantics/FrameAxioms.lean`).
  * **Injectivity-at-zero** (`TaskRel w 0 u → w = u`) follows from the `limit` field **alone**,
    by instantiating its cone witness at `y := 0`: for every `x > 0` we have `|0| < x` and
    `TaskRel w 0 u`, so `limit` forces `u = w`. *Seriality* is not needed for this half.

  Verbatim, `lem:nullity` reads: "$w \Rightarrow_0 w$ for every world state $w \in W$ in every
  task frame $\F = \tuple{W, \D, \Rightarrow}$." It asserts reflexivity only, which is why
  the second bullet is the part that had to be checked separately.

  Both derivations typecheck against this module's own predicates:

  ```lean
  theorem inj_at_zero_of_limit {W : Type} {R : W → D → W → Prop}
      (hLim : ∀ w u, (∀ x : D, 0 < x → ∃ y, |y| < x ∧ R w y u) → u = w)
      (w u : W) (h : R w 0 u) : u = w :=
    hLim w u fun x hx => ⟨0, by simpa using hx, h⟩

  theorem nullity_iff_of_serial_limit {W : Type} {R : W → D → W → Prop}
      (hSer : TaskFrame.Serial R)
      (hLim : ∀ w u, (∀ x : D, 0 < x → ∃ y, |y| < x ∧ R w y u) → u = w)
      (w u : W) : R w 0 u ↔ w = u :=
    ⟨fun h => (inj_at_zero_of_limit hLim w u h).symm,
     fun h => h ▸ TaskFrame.nullity_of_serial_limit hSer hLim w⟩
  ```

  **Consequences.** The Lean frame class
  `{nullity_identity, comp, converse, serial, limit, saturation}` and the paper's four `def:frame`
  axioms plus nonempty `W` plus the converse convention are **inter-derivable**: the Lean class
  adds no content the paper lacks, and imposes no constraint the paper does not. In particular
  the `⊇` half of *Limit*'s `⋂_{x>0}(w)_x = {w}` — that `w` itself lies in every positive cone —
  is exactly reflexivity-at-zero, so it is supplied by the first bullet rather than assumed.

  **The field is kept.** With derivability settled, deleting it versus retaining it is an
  *ergonomic* call, not a mathematical one — deletion would break every construction site that
  currently discharges it directly. It is retained here as documented redundancy for construction
  ergonomics. The deletion question is an owner decision and is recorded as such in this task's
  author memo; it is not settled by this module either way.

  Stated by citation as `TaskFrame.Compositional TaskRel`, never restated inline. Unfolded it is

  Both directions are load bearing. Its `←` (composition) half is projected back out as the

  of the old field is untouched; its `→` (interpolation) half is projected out as
  `FrameOver.interpolates`, definitionally `TaskFrame.Interpolates TaskRel`.

  The `0 ≤ x`, `0 ≤ y` hypotheses are how the paper's positive-cone domain restriction is
  expressed against the two-sided extended relation. Composition over negative durations is
  derived (`backward_comp`); mixed-sign composition is inexpressible at the primitive level

  lives on the positive cone `D⁺ = {x : 0 ≤ x}` and is extended to negative durations by the
  converse convention (`def:task-relation`, verbatim: "extended to negative durations by the
  \textit{converse convention} $w \Rightarrow_{-x} u \coloneq u \Rightarrow_{x} w$ for
  $x \geq 0$"). A two-sided
  Lean relation cannot carry that stipulation in its type, so it is carried as this field: the
  pair (two-sided `TaskRel`, `converse`) is precisely the paper's *extended* relation over a
  primitive relation on `D⁺`, and it constrains the negative half of `TaskRel` to be exactly
  the reflection of the positive half rather than adding independent content.

  This is exactly what `TaskFrame.limit_of_succOrder`, `TaskFrame.limit_of_shift`, and the

/-! ## Bare-relation discharge helpers

Everything below is stated against a bare relation `R : W → D → W → Prop` over an ambient
carrier, never against a frame field, so it applies to any relation whether or not a frame
carries it. That is why it belongs in `TaskFrame` beside the bare-relation predicates of record
(`Serial`, `Interpolates`, `Saturation`) rather than in the fibre namespace.

### Limit discharge helpers

The paper's *Limit* axiom (`def:frame#Limit`, verbatim: "$\bigcap\limits_{x > 0} (w)_x =
\set{w}$") transcribes against the extended relation as

```
∀ w u, (∀ x, 0 < x → ∃ y, |y| < x ∧ R w y u) → u = w
```

The two theorems below are the two reusable ways to discharge that obligation. They are stated
against a bare relation `R : W → D → W → Prop` rather than against a `FrameOver` field, so they
apply verbatim to a frame's `TaskRel` whether or not the axiom is carried as structure data.
(An earlier paper wave folded Nullity into this axiom's name; the paper's current name is
simply *Limit*, and the helpers are named accordingly.)
-/

/--
*Limit* holds automatically over a duration type with a successor operation.

Over a `SuccOrder`, `Order.succ 0` is a positive duration with nothing strictly between it and
`0` in absolute value, so the hypothesis at `x = Order.succ 0` already forces the witness
duration to be `0`, and iff-Nullity closes the goal. This discharges every frame whose duration
type is discrete (`Int` in particular).

`NoMaxOrder D` is what makes `0 < Order.succ 0` available; it is *not* an extra burden in
practice, because `[AddCommGroup D] [LinearOrder D] [IsOrderedAddMonoid D] [Nontrivial D]`
already implies it by instance search. The repo's standard discrete binder bundle
(`[SuccOrder D] [PredOrder D] [IsSuccArchimedean D] [IsPredArchimedean D] [Nontrivial D]`, used
throughout `SoundnessLemmas/FrameClassVariants.lean`) therefore subsumes both hypotheses, and no
frame carrying that bundle needs any new hypothesis to apply this lemma. `IsSuccArchimedean` is
not used.

*Limit* holds for any deterministic-shift frame, over *any* duration type — dense included.

A frame is a *deterministic shift* when the duration of a transition is recoverable from its
endpoints, via a position function `pos : W → D` with `R w y u → pos u = pos w + y`. The witness
duration supplied by the *Limit* hypothesis is then the *same* `pos u - pos w` for every
radius `x`, so `|pos u - pos w| < x` for all `x > 0` and the shift must be `0`; `hzero` then
closes the goal.

`[Nontrivial D]` is genuinely required and is not an artifact of the proof: over a trivial
duration group no positive `x` exists, the hypothesis is vacuous, and the conclusion fails (take
`R := fun _ _ _ => False` on a two-element carrier). The paper independently mandates a
nontrivial totally ordered abelian group for exactly this reason.

This is the shape of every flow-style frame — carriers of the form `Index × D` whose relation
advances the second component by the duration — so it is the discharge route for the bundled
flow frames as well as the multi-family bridge frames.

/--
On a finite carrier, *Limit* upgrades to a *uniform* positive radius around each state.

*Limit* is a pointwise limit statement: for each `u ≠ w` there is *some* radius below
which `u` is unreachable from `w`. When the carrier is finite, taking the minimum of those
radii over the carrier turns this into a single positive `x` that works for every `u` at once:
nothing but `w` is reachable from `w` within `x`.

**Consequence.** A finite frame satisfying *Limit* over a densely ordered duration type is
temporally *rigid*: a convex history through `w` at time `t` is constant on `(t - x, t + x)`, so
over a dense duration domain histories are locally constant. That is the correct content of the
axiom, not a defect — but it means the filtration and FMP frames cannot remain
dense-polymorphic once *Limit* is carried as a frame axiom. The move of FMP to `ℤ` is
therefore forced by the axiom rather than being a convenience.

**Status.** This is the deliberate substitute for the paper's cone-topology T1 result
(`app:topology-r0`). Formalizing that result requires first building the cone topology — `(w)_x`
as a basis, a proof that it *is* a basis, a `TopologicalSpace` instance — and no topology exists
anywhere in this library; the infrastructure, not the one-line proof, is the cost. This lemma
gives a machine-checked consequence of *Limit* in the same cost bracket, is topology-free,
and has direct bearing on the finite-model constructions.

## Reusable axiom-class discharge helpers

Every live frame construction in this library whose relation is *not* a deterministic
shift falls into one of three relation classes, and each class discharges `def:frame`'s four
axioms once and for all:

- **total** — `R w x u` for all `w`, `x`, `u`, on a `Subsingleton` carrier (`trivialFrame`,
  `intTimeFrame`, `genericTimeFrame`);
- **permissive** — `R w d u ↔ (d ≠ 0 ∨ w = u)` (`natFrame`, `intNatFrame`, `genericNatFrame`,
  and the test frames);
- **equality** — `R w d u ↔ w = u` (`staticFrame`).

The fourth class, deterministic shift, is already served by `limit_of_shift` above.

Each helper takes the class membership as an `Iff` hypothesis rather than matching a literal
lambda, so a site discharges it with `fun _ _ _ => Iff.rfl` and no defeq-unfolding risk. Every
conclusion is *syntactically* `Serial R` / `Interpolates R` / `Saturation R`, or the literal
transcribed *Limit* shape `∀ w u, (∀ x, 0 < x → ∃ y, |y| < x ∧ R w y u) → u = w` that
`limit_of_succOrder` and `limit_of_shift` conclude and `nullity_of_serial_limit` consumes — never
a restatement.

A nontrivial totally ordered abelian group has a positive element.

The paper mandates a nontrivial duration group (`def:frame`), and this is the one consequence of
that mandate the *Limit* arguments actually use: without a positive radius the *Limit* hypothesis
is vacuous and the axiom is unprovable.

The *Saturation* core argument for every relation whose nonempty fibers and segments are each
either the whole carrier or a singleton.

Recorded source (`def:frame`'s opening clause, verbatim): "Letting a nonempty family of sets
$\mathcal{S}$ be \textit{$\supseteq$-directed} just in case $S \subseteq S_1 \cap S_2$ for some
$S \in \mathcal{S}$ whenever $S_1, S_2 \in \mathcal{S}$".

If some member is a singleton `{a}`, directedness forces `a` into every other member: the
witness `S' ⊆ {a} ∩ t` is nonempty, so its point is both `a` and a point of `t`. If no member is
a singleton, every member is the whole carrier and any point of any member serves. This is the
`⊆`-least-member argument `lem:step`'s closing remark uses, isolated so that the permissive and
equality classes can both cite it.

The *Saturation* core argument for a directed family that has a `⊆`-minimal member: **the paper's
actual mathematical content, in fully constructive form**.

Recorded source (`cor:saturation-finite`, via `specs/paper-definitions-of-record.md`, verbatim:
"Every task frame $\F = \tuple{W, \D, \Rightarrow}$ with finite $W$ satisfies \textit{Saturation},
choice-free."), whose argument is: directedness upgrades a `⊆`-minimal member to a `⊆`-*least*
member, and a least member is both nonempty and equal to the intersection.

Given a minimal `Sstar` and any other member `T`, directedness supplies `S' ∈ S` with
`S' ⊆ Sstar ∩ T`. Then `S' ⊆ Sstar`, so minimality forces `Sstar ⊆ S'`, and composing gives
`Sstar ⊆ T`. So `Sstar` is contained in every member, and any of its points — it is nonempty by
hypothesis — lies in `⋂₀ S`.

**This lemma depends on no axioms at all** (not even `propext`), which is the sense in which the
paper's choice-free claim survives transcription. The classical content of `cor:saturation-finite`
lives entirely in *producing* the minimal member from finiteness, which is what
`saturation_of_finite` below adds on top. Separating the two is deliberate: it puts the
constructive core on the record independently of the classical step, and it makes the lemma
reusable at any carrier where a minimal member is available by other means.

The companion `sInter_nonempty_of_directed_of_univ_or_singleton` above serves the disjoint case
where every member is the whole carrier or a singleton; neither subsumes the other.

**Every relation on a finite carrier satisfies *Saturation***.

Recorded source (`cor:saturation-finite`, via `specs/paper-definitions-of-record.md`, verbatim:
"Every task frame $\F = \tuple{W, \D, \Rightarrow}$ with finite $W$ satisfies \textit{Saturation},
choice-free."). Since `Set W` is well-founded under `<` when `W` is finite, a directed family has
a `⊆`-minimal member; `sInter_nonempty_of_directed_of_minimal` above then closes the goal.

**Indifferent to the kind of member.** The proof consumes only *finiteness*, *directedness*, and
*member nonemptiness*; the `IsFiber R s ∨ IsSegment R s` disjunct is never used. That matches the
paper's own `%% CHANGE (sigma-elim)` remark that the finite-`W` argument does not care whether a
member is a fiber or a segment.

**Obstruction note — why this lemma is not, and cannot be, `Classical.choice`-free.**
The paper's "choice-free" is a claim about **ZF vs ZFC**: the argument does not need the axiom of
choice, *given classical logic*. Lean's `Classical.choice` is a different object — the single
axiom from which Lean derives **both** excluded middle (via Diaconescu) and AC — so
`#print axioms` has no vocabulary in which to state the paper's distinction. Worse, the
`Classical.choice`-free version is not merely hard but **impossible**: weak excluded middle
(`¬¬P ∨ ¬P`) is derivable from `Saturation R` at the finite carrier `Bool` over `D = Int`, using
`R w d u := (d = 0 ∧ w = u) ∨ (d = 3)`, from `[propext, Quot.sound]` alone. A choice-free proof of
this lemma would therefore prove WLEM in Lean's intuitionistic core, where it is not derivable.
This is a mismatch between the paper's metatheory and Lean's axiom accounting, not a defect in
either. What *is* preserved, and what the corollary is actually for, is the absence of **Zorn**:
this proof does not route through `PartialHistory.exists_maximal_extension`, in deliberate
contrast with `thm:extension`, which does.

**Do not re-derive the existing class helpers from this lemma.** `saturation_of_subsingleton`
depends on exactly `[propext]`; routing it (or `saturation_of_permissive`, or `saturation_of_eq`)
through this lemma would regress it to `Classical.choice` and propagate that regression to the
three `Unit`-carriered universal frames that consume it. This lemma is an **additional** route for
relations of arbitrary shape — the case no existing helper covers, since each of those constrains
the relation's shape — never a consolidation of them.

/-! ## Frame constants

Three small frames used throughout the tree and the test suite, each a value of the fibre over
the temporal order of an ambient carrier `D`. They live in `FrameOver` so that dot notation on
a fibre-typed frame reaches them.

### The `(D : TemporalOrder)` migration was measured and **declined**

`trivialFrame`, `staticFrame` and `natFrame` keep an ambient bare-`Type` carrier `D` and a type
`FrameOver (TemporalOrder.of D)`, rather than taking a `(D : TemporalOrder)` binder directly.
That is a decision on counted evidence, not an omission, and this is its record so that it is not
re-opened.

**The measurement** (whole repository, `FormalSystem/` and `Tests/`, at the time of the count):

| Constant | Occurrences | Explicit `(D := …)` | of which **concrete** (`Int`/`ℤ`/`ℚ`/`ℤ ×ₗ ℤ`) | of which **abstract** (`D`/`↑D`) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `trivialFrame` | 61 | 33 | 21 | 12 |
| `staticFrame`  | 61 | 43 |  9 | 34 |
| `natFrame`     | 53 | 25 | 17 |  8 |
| **total**      | 175 | **101** | **47** | **54** |

**Why that count decides it.** The migration was expected to be a mechanical
`(D := ℤ) → (D := intOrder)` rewrite that *removed* annotations. It removes none. A concrete site
still has to name its order — nothing in `trivialFrame`'s type determines `D`, since its
`WorldState` is `Unit` — so all 47 concrete annotations survive the migration, merely renamed.
Meanwhile each of the **54 abstract** sites, where the surrounding declaration binds `D : Type`
because a neighbouring abstraction pins it to a bare type (`BFMCS` in the bundle layer,
`FrameConditionFor`, `TemporalCarrier`, and the frame-condition family
`C : (D : Type) → … → Prop` in the decidability bridge), would have to grow into
`(D := TemporalOrder.of D)`. Unification cannot invert `TemporalOrder.carrier ?D =?= D`, so the
wrapper cannot be left implicit. Net annotation count: 101 → 101, with 54 of them strictly
longer. The phase's GO condition was a *strict decrease*; the measurement is a strict
non-improvement.

This is the same finding `TemporalOrder.of`'s own docstring records as "Kept permanently, on
evidence", now with the counts behind it. The corresponding tidy-up that *was* taken is the
converse one: `Examples/TemporalStructures.lean`'s `genericTimeFrame` and `genericNatFrame`,
which are already `(D : TemporalOrder)`, are now `abbrev`s pointing at `trivialFrame` and
`natFrame` here, so the two binder shapes share one definition rather than duplicating it.
`TemporalOrder.of ↑D` is `D` by `rfl` (structure eta), which is what makes that direction free
while this one is not.

Static task frame: every world state is related to itself, and only itself, at every duration.

World states can be any type. `TaskRel w x u` holds iff `w = u`, for every duration `x`:
nothing ever changes, at any timescale. Polymorphic over both world state type and temporal
type.

This frame replaces the former zero-duration-only identity frame
(`TaskRel := fun w x u => w = u ∧ x = 0`), which violated the paper's *Seriality* axiom
(`def:frame#Seriality`, verbatim: "$w \Rightarrow_x u$ and $v \Rightarrow_x w$ for some
$u, v \in W$") over every nontrivial duration type: at any `x > 0` no successor existed. The
static relation satisfies all four recorded axioms of `def:frame` — *Compositionality* in both
directions (interpolate through `w` itself), *Seriality* (`staticFrame_serial` below),
*Limit* (only `w` is reachable from `w` at all), and *Saturation* (every nonempty fiber and
segment is the same singleton along a directed family) — as well as every field of the current
structure.

The `[Nontrivial D]` binder is carried because `staticFrame_limit` requires it: over a trivial
duration type `0 < x` is unsatisfiable, so *Limit*'s hypothesis is vacuous and the conclusion
`u = w` cannot be reached. Every reference to this frame elaborates at `Int`, which supplies the
instance.

Natural number based task frame.

World states are natural numbers. Task relation: `TaskRel w d u` holds iff
either `d ≠ 0` (any transition for non-zero duration) or `w = u` (identity for zero duration).
This satisfies nullity_identity while remaining permissive.
Polymorphic over temporal type `D`.

The `[SuccOrder D] [NoMaxOrder D]` binders are carried because `natFrame_limit` requires them:
over a dense `D` the permissive relation puts every state in every cone of every other state and

# The bundled frame

`def:frame` reads a task frame as `F = ⟨W, 𝔇, ⇒⟩`: the temporal order is a *component* of the
frame, on the same footing as the world-state carrier and the task relation. `TaskFrame` carries
it as the field `Duration`, so the encoding unfolds exactly as the paper writes it, and
`FrameOver D` above is the fibre over a fixed such component.

The consequence that motivates the shape: a property of the temporal order alone cannot be
predicated of a frame while the order is an *index*, so density, discreteness and Dedekind
completeness would have to be quantified at the carrier rather than asserted of the frame. With
`Duration` a field they are ordinary predicates on a `TaskFrame` — `def:frame-properties` reads
as the paper states it.

The transitional aliases and bridge definitions that carried the migration have been removed;
`FrameOver.toTaskFrame` and `instCoeOutFrameOver` are their permanent replacements.
-/

/--
**A task frame** `F = ⟨W, D, ⇒⟩` (`def:frame`), with the temporal order carried as the field
`Duration`.

The algebra of `Duration` — abelian group, linear order, order-compatible addition,
nontriviality: `def:temporal-order`'s "nontrivial totally ordered abelian group" — is carried
as instance-implicit *fields* rather than as instance binders on the structure, for the reason
already recorded for `worldNonempty`: a binder must be supplied at every mention of the type,
whereas a field is discharged once per frame at its construction site.

Instance-implicit fields are in scope for the types of later fields, so the four axiom fields
still cite the bare-relation predicates of record *definitionally* — see the definitional-content
`example`s at the end of this module, which are what keep the frame and the Step Lemma chain
from drifting apart.

**The canonical inclusion of a fibre into the total space.**

This is the constructor. `FrameOver D → TaskFrame` needs no coercion, no transport and no
universe crossing: a frame over `D` *is* the second component of a total-space frame whose first
component is `D`, and `(F.toTaskFrame).toFibre = F`, `(F.toTaskFrame).Duration = D` and
`⟨G.Duration, G.toFibre⟩ = G` all hold by `rfl`.

**A fibre value is usable wherever the total space is expected**, via the inclusion.

`ConvexHistory`, `TaskModel` and `TruthAt` are stated over `TaskFrame`, so every fibre-typed frame
has to reach the total space to be used with them. Writing `.toTaskFrame` at each such site would
be pure noise: the inclusion is the constructor and carries no content.

This was introduced as the permanent replacement for the migration's transitional `CoeOut`, and the
reason that one can be deleted without a per-site campaign. It also covers the case that
instance no longer can: for an *abstract* `(D : TemporalOrder)`, matching
a `FrameOver ⟨?E⟩`-shaped instance against `FrameOver D` needs structure eta on `D` at
reducible transparency, which instance resolution does not perform. Both coercions produce the
same term — `⟨D, F⟩` — so which one fires is never observable.

### The flat surface, preserved

`TaskFrame`'s fields are `Duration` and `toFibre`, but every consumer in the tree writes
`F.WorldState`, `F.TaskRel w d u` and `F.saturation`. Generalized field notation resolves by the
head constant of `F`'s type and never consults a coercion, so those spellings are kept alive as
**delegating accessors** rather than by asking several hundred sites to write `F.toFibre.…`.

The data accessors are `@[reducible]`, which is what keeps `F.WorldState` transparent to
unification and to instance synthesis. The Prop-valued ones are `theorem`s: Lean rejects
`@[reducible]` on a proof, and by proof irrelevance nothing is lost — what a consumer needs is
that the *declared type* is literally the recorded bare-relation predicate at `F.TaskRel`, which
it is, so the Step Lemma's consumption of `F.saturation` stays definitional at both levels.

/-! ## The round trip, and the total-space identity

`TaskFrame` is `Σ (D : TemporalOrder), FrameOver D`, and structure eta makes that an *identity*
rather than an isomorphism-up-to-transport: the pair of a frame's two projections **is** the
frame, by `rfl`, and the inclusion of a fibre is the constructor, so both round trips are `rfl`
too. This is what replaces v01's `CoeOut` device, and it is why there is no shim ledger in this
refactor. The block below is that identity mechanized, together with the exported algebra on a
bundled frame's `Duration`.

Merged from two sections — `BridgeChecks` and `TotalSpaceIdentity` — that checked the same round
trip from its two ends.

-- The inclusion is a definitional isomorphism: both round trips are `rfl` by structure eta.
example (F : TaskFrame) : F.toFibre.toTaskFrame = F := rfl
example (F : TaskFrame) : (⟨F.Duration, F.toFibre⟩ : TaskFrame) = F := rfl

example {E : TemporalOrder} (F : FrameOver E) : F.toTaskFrame.TaskRel = F.TaskRel := rfl

-- The flat accessors are the fibre's fields, definitionally -- which is what keeps the migrated
-- files' spellings (`F.WorldState`, `F.TaskRel w d u`, `F.saturation`) meaning exactly what they
-- meant before, and what keeps the Step Lemma's consumption of `saturation` definitional.
example (F : TaskFrame) : F.WorldState = F.toFibre.WorldState := rfl
example (F : TaskFrame) : F.TaskRel = F.toFibre.TaskRel := rfl

-- A finite total-space frame forgets to a total-space frame by the same constructor.
example (F : FiniteTaskFrame) : F.toTaskFrame.Duration = F.Duration := rfl
example (F : FiniteTaskFrame) : F.toTaskFrame.WorldState = F.WorldState := rfl

-- The exported algebra on a bundled frame's `Duration`.

/-! ## The definitional-content checks, at all three ambient shapes

The Cross-Task Acceptance Criterion for the axiom fields is that each is *literally* the recorded
bare-relation predicate, never an equivalent restatement — because the Step Lemma
(`Semantics/Extension/Step.lean`) consumes the predicates, and an inert field that merely
*implied* them would let the frame and the chain drift apart silently. Each `example` below
elaborates by citation alone, and would fail the moment a field's statement were restated.

The check is run once per shape a frame is written in — the bundled `TaskFrame`, the fibre
`FrameOver D` (the sole declaration site of the axioms), and the two finite forms — plus the
`TemporalOrder.of` identity that lets a frame over an ambient carrier be the same fibre.

Merged from three sections — `BundledDefinitionalContent`, `DefinitionalContent` and
`FibreDefinitionalContent` — that repeated the same four checks once per shape.
