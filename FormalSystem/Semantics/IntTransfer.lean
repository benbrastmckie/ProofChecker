# Carrier Normalization: Transporting the Semantics along a Duration Isomorphism

`ValidZTime` quantifies over *every* discrete duration carrier `D` — every nontrivial
successor-Archimedean ordered abelian group. This module shows that quantifier is redundant:
one carrier, `ℤ`, already decides it. The headline result is

  `validZTime_iff_validInt : ValidZTime φ ↔ ValidInt φ`

and the machinery that gets there is a generic transport of the whole semantic stack —
the frame, `TaskModel`, `ConvexHistory`, `TruthAt` — along an arbitrary ordered-group
isomorphism `e : D ≃+o E`. The isomorphism that specializes it to `ℤ` is
`DurationClassification.lean`'s `intIso`.

Note the transport is stated for `≃+o`, an *additive order* isomorphism, not `≃o`. Durations
**add** — `TaskRel`'s Compositionality is stated at `x + y` — so an order-only isomorphism
cannot carry a frame across. This is why `orderIsoIntOfLinearSuccPredArch`, which fits the
`ValidZTime` binder bundle verbatim, is not the route; see the `archimedean_of_lub` docstring
in `Semantics/DurationClassification.lean` for the full recorded finding.

## Design decision: `Aligned`, not `Equiv`

There is no `ConvexHistory F ≃ ConvexHistory (F.map e)` here, and there deliberately is not one.
Round-tripping `ConvexHistory.map` and `ConvexHistory.comap` forces a *dependent* equality on the
`states` field — `states` is indexed by a proof of `domain`, so the two round-tripped fields do
not even have the same type until the domain equation is transported — and the proof degenerates
into `HEq` wrangling.

The `Prop`-valued relation `Aligned` avoids this entirely. `Aligned.st` is a **non-dependent**
equation between two `F.WorldState` terms, because `(FrameOver.map F e).WorldState` is
*definitionally* `F.WorldState`. Its one genuine transport is discharged by the tree's existing
`ConvexHistory.states_eq_of_time_eq`. Do not replace `Aligned` with an `Equiv`.

`Aligned e` is, verbatim, the `Rel` field of a `Semantics.TruthCorr` (`alignedCorr` below): the
generic relational transport `Truth.truthAt_of_truthCorr` asks for a relation on histories, atomic
agreement on related pairs, and existence of a related total history in each direction — never
for an inverse. That is why no `Equiv` was ever needed, and why `truthAt_map` is now a one-line
instance of the generic lemma rather than its own induction.

## Recorded tactic traps

Two measured failures, recorded so a future editor does not re-hit them:

* `simpa` does **not** close `(ConvexHistory.comap e ρ').domain s` from `ρ'.domain (e s)`. The
  equality is *definitional* and `simp` normalizes straight past it. Use the bare term
  `fun s => hρ' (e s)` (`alignedCorr.total_bwd`).
* `linarith` does not fire on the bare `AddCommGroup` + `LinearOrder` bundle these lemmas run
  on — there is no ring structure. (This one bites in `DurationClassification.lean`'s
  `succ_eq_add_succ_zero`, not here, but it is the same binder bundle.)

## Main results

- `FrameOver.map`: transport a task frame along `e : D ≃+o E`, all seven fields.
- `TaskModel.map`, `ConvexHistory.map`, `ConvexHistory.comap`: the model and history transports.
- `Aligned`, `aligned_map`, `aligned_comap`, `isTotal_map`: the `HEq`-free correspondence
  between a history and its transport.
- `alignedCorr`: `Aligned e` packaged as a `TruthCorr M (M.map e)`.
- `truthAt_map`: `TruthAt M σ t φ ↔ TruthAt (M.map e) σ' (e t) φ` for aligned `σ`, `σ'` —
  `Truth.truthAt_of_truthCorr` at `alignedCorr`.
- `ValidInt`: validity over `ℤ`-frames only.
- `validZTime_iff_validInt`: **carrier normalization** — `ValidZTime φ ↔ ValidInt φ`.

## Is this base change along a temporal-order morphism?

**Verdict: only along isomorphisms, and that restriction is forced — not incidental.**

`FrameOver.map F e` *is* reindexing: it leaves `WorldState` alone and precomposes `TaskRel`'s
duration argument with `e.symm`, so as a construction it is base change along `e.symm : ↑E → ↑D`,
carrying the fibre over `D` to the fibre over `E`. To that extent the suspicion is correct and the
fibration language names something already here.

But the construction does **not** generalize to a one-directional morphism, and the obstruction is
identifiable to a single axiom. Read the field proofs:

| field | what it uses | needs |
|---|---|---|
| `nullity_identity`, `converse` | `map_zero`, `map_neg` | a group hom |
| `comp`, `serial`, `saturation` | `map_le_map_iff e.symm` in the `.mpr` direction | `e.symm` order-reflecting |
| **`limit`** | `map_lt_map_iff e` **and** `map_lt_map_iff e.symm` | **both directions** |

*Limit* is the one that forces it. Its hypothesis is instantiated at `e x` — pushing a duration
*forward* — while its witness is produced as `e.symm n`, pulling one *back*. A base change along a
morphism `g : ↑E → ↑D` with no inverse has nothing to instantiate the hypothesis with. Nor is this
an artifact of the proof: *Limit* says every positive cone shrinks to a point, and a
non-surjective reindexing can omit precisely the small durations that witness it.

Everything downstream inherits the restriction. `ConvexHistory.comap`, and through it the `box`
case of `truthAt_map`, consume `e` in the *forward* direction, so the truth-transfer theorem is an
equivalence of fibres induced by an isomorphism of bases, not a functorial action of a morphism.

**Consequence for scope.** There is no general `FrameOver.baseChange` hiding in this file waiting
to be named, and introducing one would require new mathematics — a genuine theory of
temporal-order morphisms, with *Limit* re-proved under whatever weaker hypothesis turns out to
suffice. That is out of scope here and is recorded as a finding, not a deferral: what this module
contains is the statement that **the fibres over isomorphic temporal orders are equivalent**, at
the frame (`map`), model (`TaskModel.map`), history (`map`/`comap`/`Aligned`) and truth
(`truthAt_map`) levels. The declarations below are migrated to the fibre and otherwise left
exactly as they were.

Transport a task frame along an ordered-group isomorphism of temporal orders.

The world states are carried over unchanged — only the duration index of `TaskRel` moves, by
pulling back along `e.symm`. Each of the seven fields is then the original field composed with
`e.symm`, with `map_add`/`map_neg`/`map_sub` and `map_le_map_iff`/`map_lt_map_iff` supplying the
compatibility.

The *Saturation* field is the cheapest of the interesting ones rather than the most expensive:
under an ordered-group isomorphism the fiber and segment predicates (`TaskFrame.Fib`,
`TaskFrame.Seg`) pick out the *identical* subsets of `WorldState`, so `F.saturation` is handed
back the **same** directed family. No directedness argument is reconstructed.

Two histories over corresponding frames agree pointwise under `e`.

**Why a relation and not an `Equiv`.** The obvious alternative — an equivalence
`ConvexHistory F ≃ ConvexHistory (FrameOver.map F e).toTaskFrame` — does not survive contact with the `states`
field, which is *dependent*: it is indexed by a proof of `domain`. Round-tripping `map` and
`comap` therefore forces a dependent structure equality and degenerates into `HEq` wrangling.

`Aligned` sidesteps this. Because `(FrameOver.map F e).WorldState` is **definitionally**
`F.WorldState`, the field `st` is an ordinary non-dependent equation between two `F.WorldState`
terms, and its only genuine transport (in `aligned_comap`) is discharged by the tree's existing
`ConvexHistory.states_eq_of_time_eq`. No `HEq` appears anywhere in this module; an `HEq` showing
up is the signal that the forbidden `Equiv` route was taken.

Pull a history back along `e` from the transported frame to the original.

This is the direction `truthAt_map`'s `box` case needs: `□` quantifies over histories of the

produce a `ConvexHistory F`.

A pulled-back history is aligned with the one it came from.

Unlike `aligned_map` this is not definitional: the domain and state equations sit at
`e (e.symm n)` rather than `n`. The `dom` half is `simp`; the `st` half is exactly what the
tree's existing `ConvexHistory.states_eq_of_time_eq` is for, and no new transport lemma is needed.

**The frame transport is a truth correspondence.** `Aligned e` is the relation, `e` (as an order
isomorphism) the time reindexing, and the two totality witnesses are `ConvexHistory.map` (forward,
with `isTotal_map`) and `ConvexHistory.comap` (backward).

The `atom` field is the only place any real work happens: it is the domain/state agreement of
`Aligned` unfolded at one time, with `σ.states_eq_of_time_eq` bridging `e.symm (e t)` and `t`.

Trap, recorded: in `total_bwd`, `(ConvexHistory.comap e σ').domain s` follows from
`σ'.domain (e s)` **definitionally**, and `simpa` normalizes past it and fails. The bare term
`fun s => hσ' (e s)` is the proof.

**Carrier normalization.** Quantifying over every discrete duration carrier is the same as
quantifying over `ℤ` alone.

The forward direction is a single instantiation: `ℤ` discharges the whole `ValidZTime` binder
bundle, so `h ℤ F M τ hτ t` is the proof.

The reverse direction is where the work is. Given an arbitrary discrete carrier `D`,
`DurationClassification.lean`'s `intIso : D ≃+o ℤ` normalizes it, `FrameOver.map` /
`TaskModel.map` / `ConvexHistory.map` carry the model across, `isTotal_map` carries totality, and
`truthAt_map` carries truth back. Note the transfer must be an *additive* order isomorphism:
durations add, so the order-only `orderIsoIntOfLinearSuccPredArch` could not be used here.

`ValidZTime`'s `PredOrder`/`IsPredArchimedean` binders go unused — `intIso` needs only the
successor half.
