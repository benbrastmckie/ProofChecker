# The derived nullity lemma, and the constraints imposed on a new duration

This module derives `lem:nullity` from *Seriality* and *Limit*, transcribes `def:constraints`,
and proves the fiber/segment classification lemmas that `def:constraints` supports.

## Where the axiom predicates live

*Saturation*, *Seriality*, and the interpolation half of *Compositionality* are `Prop`-valued
predicates over a **bare task relation** `R : W → D → W → Prop`, and are declared in
`Semantics/TaskFrame.lean` **above** the `FrameOver` structure — a structure field's type may
only mention earlier declarations, so that is where they must live for the fields to cite them.
This module consumes them.

## The fields, and the invariant they were held to

`FrameOver` now carries all four of `def:frame`'s axioms: `comp` (the full biconditional
*Compositionality*, as `TaskFrame.Compositional TaskRel`), `serial`, `limit`, and `saturation`.
The hard invariant recorded in `specs/decisions/total-history-validity-decisions.md` (the
four-axiom frame-alignment decision) was met: `FrameOver.saturation` is *definitionally*
`Saturation TaskRel`, `FrameOver.serial` is definitionally `Serial TaskRel`, and the
interpolation half of biconditional *Compositionality* is available as `FrameOver.interpolates`,
definitionally `Interpolates TaskRel`. Discharging a downstream hypothesis is therefore a
mechanical substitution (`F.saturation`, `F.serial`, `F.interpolates`) with zero restatement; a
field whose statement differed would make the results that consume these predicates stop
typechecking, and that compilation failure *is* the acceptance test.

The bare-relation form is retained alongside the fields on purpose: results that need only one
axiom take exactly that axiom as an explicit hypothesis, and remain applicable to a relation
that is not (yet) packaged as a frame.

*Saturation* in particular must be literally the hypothesis the Step Lemma's proof consumes at the
sole application site the paper names, never an inert structure field.

## Paper Specification Reference

Anchors below are `\label` keys into `specs/paper-definitions-of-record.md`, which — not the
paper source — is the citation source of record.

- *Compositionality* (`def:frame#Compositionality`, verbatim): "$w \Rightarrow_{x + y} v$ if and
  only if $w \Rightarrow_x u$ and $u \Rightarrow_y v$ for some $u \in W$."
- *Seriality* (`def:frame#Seriality`, verbatim): "$w \Rightarrow_x u$ and $v \Rightarrow_x w$ for
  some $u, v \in W$."
- *Limit* (`def:frame#Limit`, verbatim): "$\bigcap\limits_{x > 0} (w)_x = \set{w}$."
- *Saturation* (`def:frame#Saturation`, verbatim): "$\bigcap \mathcal{S} \neq \emptyset$ for any
  $\supseteq$-directed family $\mathcal{S}$ of nonempty fibers and segments."
- `def:frame`'s opening clause (verbatim): "Letting a nonempty family of sets $\mathcal{S}$ be
  \textit{$\supseteq$-directed} just in case $S \subseteq S_1 \cap S_2$ for some
  $S \in \mathcal{S}$ whenever $S_1, S_2 \in \mathcal{S}$". This is where the family's own
  nonemptiness comes from. **Retired anchor.** This clause used to be the standalone
  `def:directed`, which the paper's 2026-09 wave folded inline into `def:frame` and deleted;
  `def:directed` is recorded `DANGLING` in `specs/paper-definitions-of-record.md`. The old
  definition had a `$\supseteq$-Directed` and a `$\subseteq$-Directed` clause, of which
  *Saturation* — and hence `DirectedFamily` — consumed the `$\supseteq$` half only; the paper now
  defines only that half, so the split no longer exists to choose from.
- `lem:nullity` (verbatim): "$w \Rightarrow_0 w$ for every world state $w \in W$ in every task
  frame $\F = \tuple{W, \D, \Rightarrow}$."
- `def:constraints` (verbatim): "For a partial history $\tau : X \to W$ over a task frame $\F$
  and duration $z \in D \setminus X$, the \textit{constraints on $z$} are the segments
  $[\tau(t), \tau(s)]_{z-t}^{s-z}$ for times $t,s \in X$ where $t < z < s$ when both
  $t,s \in X$, and the fibers $\fib{\tau(t), z - t}$ for $t \in X$ otherwise."

The `Fib` / `Seg` / `DirectedFamily` / `IsFiber` / `IsSegment` apparatus these statements are
built from lives in `TaskFrame.lean`, transcribed there from `def:task-relation` and (for
`DirectedFamily`) from `def:frame`'s opening clause, formerly the now-retired `def:directed`.

## Main Definitions

- `TaskFrame.Saturation` — the *Saturation* axiom over a bare relation
- `TaskFrame.Serial` — the *Seriality* axiom over a bare relation
- `TaskFrame.Interpolates` — the interpolation (left-to-right) half of *Compositionality*
- `PartialHistory.IsPaired` — the "otherwise" side condition of `def:constraints`
- `PartialHistory.Constraints` — `def:constraints`, the constraints imposed on a new duration

## Main Results

- `TaskFrame.nullity_of_serial_limit` — `lem:nullity`, DERIVED (not an axiom) from *Seriality* at
  `x = 0` plus *Limit*, choice-free

## Implementation Notes

- **No `FrameOver` structure field is added or changed here.** Everything is stated over a bare
  relation or over an existing frame's `TaskRel`.
- **Fibers and segments are two separate classes.** A "fibers and segments" hypothesis is always
  the disjunction `IsFiber R s ∨ IsSegment R s`. The retired device by which a one-sided fiber
  counted among the segments must not reappear.
- **Directedness is a definition of its own on the tree's side** (`TaskFrame.DirectedFamily`),
  including the nonemptiness of the *family*; the nonemptiness of its *members* is a separate
  conjunct in `Saturation`, exactly as the paper phrases it. On the paper's side it is no longer
  separate: it was the standalone `def:directed` until the 2026-09 wave inlined it into
  `def:frame`'s opening clause (`def:directed` is recorded `DANGLING`). Keeping it separate here
  is a tree-side choice, not a transcription of the paper's current structure.
- **`Limit` is deliberately not given a name here.** It is used only as a hypothesis of
  `nullity_of_serial_limit`, in the literal transcribed shape
  `∀ w u, (∀ x, 0 < x → ∃ y, |y| < x ∧ R w y u) → u = w`, which is precisely the conclusion of
  `TaskFrame.limit_of_succOrder` and `TaskFrame.limit_of_shift`. Keeping the raw shape lets those
  two existing discharge helpers be passed directly.
- Segments are written in the paper's bracket form `[w, v]_x^y` only; the retired `\Seg`
  function-application notation is gone from the paper preamble and must not be reintroduced.

## Where `Saturation` / `Serial` / `Interpolates` live

The three axiom predicates this module was originally written to host —
`TaskFrame.Saturation`, `TaskFrame.Serial`, `TaskFrame.Interpolates` — now live in
`FormalSystem/Semantics/TaskFrame.lean`, beside the `Fib` / `cone` / `Seg` / `DirectedFamily` /
`IsFiber` / `IsSegment` apparatus they are built from. Their fully qualified names, statements,
and namespace are unchanged (`FormalSystem.Semantics.TaskFrame.{Saturation,Serial,Interpolates}`),
so every consumer of this module sees them exactly as before.

The relocation is forced by the invariant recorded above: the `FrameOver` structure must be able
to carry these predicates as fields *definitionally*, and a structure field's type can only
mention declarations that precede it. A predicate declared in a module that imports
`TaskFrame.lean` can never be a `FrameOver` field. Hosting them beside the apparatus is what
makes the fields statable without restating anything.

`lem:nullity`: every world state loops at duration zero.

Recorded source (`lem:nullity`, verbatim): "$w \Rightarrow_0 w$ for every world state $w \in W$
in every task frame $\F = \tuple{W, \D, \Rightarrow}$."

**Nullity is DERIVED, not an axiom.** `def:frame` has exactly four axioms — *Compositionality*,
*Seriality*, *Limit*, *Saturation* — and Nullity is not among them. This theorem is the
derivation, from *Seriality* at `x = 0` plus *Limit*, and it is **choice-free**, in contrast with
the Extension Theorem's appeal to Zorn's lemma.

The argument is the paper's: *Seriality* at `x = 0` supplies some `u` with `w ⇒₀ u`; since
`|0| < x` for every `x > 0`, that `u` lies in the cone `(w)_x` at every positive radius, so
*Limit* forces `u = w`.

The *Limit* hypothesis is taken in the literal transcribed shape
`∀ w u, (∀ x, 0 < x → ∃ y, |y| < x ∧ R w y u) → u = w`, which is exactly what
`TaskFrame.limit_of_succOrder` and `TaskFrame.limit_of_shift` conclude, so either may be passed
directly.

Note this asserts **reflexivity only**, which is all `lem:nullity` asserts. The
`FrameOver.nullity_identity` field is an iff, and its other half — injectivity-at-zero,
`R w 0 u → u = w` — follows from the `limit` hypothesis **alone**, by instantiating the cone
witness at `y := 0`. So the field is derivable from `serial` + `limit` together and is *not* a
strengthening of the paper; see that field's own docstring in `TaskFrame.lean` for both
derivations. Nothing here strengthens or weakens the field, and nothing here depends on it.

The time `t` is *paired* about the duration `z`: some other time in the domain lies on the
opposite side of `z`, so that the two sandwich `z`.

This is the side condition behind `def:constraints`'s "otherwise": a time `t ∈ X` contributes a
*fiber* precisely when it is **not** paired, since when it is paired the constraint it imposes is
already carried by a segment (the segment `[τ(t), τ(s)]_{z-t}^{s-z}` is the intersection of the
fiber conditions at `t` and at `s`).

Both disjuncts are needed because `t` may lie on either side of `z`; `z ∉ X` is what makes the
two disjuncts exhaustive at every `t ∈ X`.

Observation, recorded but not needed here: this collapses globally. If `X` has times both below
and above `z` then *every* `t ∈ X` is paired and `Constraints τ z` consists of segments only; if
`X` lies entirely on one side of `z` then no `t` is paired and `Constraints τ z` consists of
fibers only.

`def:constraints`: the constraints imposed on a new duration `z` by a partial history `τ`.

Recorded source (`def:constraints`, verbatim): "For a partial history $\tau : X \to W$ over a
frame $\F = \tuple{W, \D, \Rightarrow}$ and duration $z \in D \setminus X$, the
\textit{constraints imposed on $z$} are the segments $[\tau(t), \tau(s)]_{z-t}^{s-z}$ for times
$t,s \in X$ where $t < z < s$, and the fibers $\Fib(\tau(t), z - t)$ for $t \in X$ otherwise."

The two clauses are the two disjuncts, in the paper's order:

- **Segments**, for every pair of domain times `t < z < s`, written in the bracket form
  `[τ(t), τ(s)]_{z-t}^{s-z}` — i.e. `Seg F.TaskRel (τ t) (τ s) (z - t) (s - z)`. Both offsets
  `z - t` and `s - z` are positive here, so each such member genuinely satisfies `IsSegment`.
- **Fibers**, `Fib(τ(t), z - t)`, for every domain time `t` that is *not* paired about `z` — the
  paper's "otherwise", transcribed as `¬ IsPaired τ z t`.

`z ∉ dom τ` (the paper's `z ∈ D \ X`) is **not** carried in this definition's type; it is a
hypothesis at the use sites that need it, matching how the `x, y ≥ 0` segment proviso is carried
by `IsSegment` rather than by `Seg`.
