# Forward recurrence: the frame-level correspondent of the density schema

The density schema `GGφ → Gφ` has **no** duration-level correspondent — a frame over a non-dense
carrier can validate every instance of it, as `Metalogic/Independence/StaticFrame.lean`'s
static frame over `ℤ` shows. What it *does* correspond to is a condition on the frame's own
structure, namely on which total histories `F.TaskRel` allows:

> whenever `s` immediately succeeds `t`, any state property holding throughout `(s, ∞)` along a
> total history already holds at `s`.

That is `TaskFrame.FwdRec`. Over a densely ordered carrier there are no covering pairs at all, so
the condition is vacuous and every frame satisfies it — which is why density's *soundness* half
never looked like a frame condition.

## Two results at two different strengths — stated separately, never merged

* **Atomic**, at arbitrary `D`: `F` validates every *atomic* instance of `GGφ → Gφ` iff `F.FwdRec`
  (`validOn_atomic_density_iff_fwdRec`, below). No hypothesis on the carrier.
* **Full schema**, at `D = ℤ` only: the schema-level statement needs the `Walk`/`MinCyc`
  periodicity apparatus, and the `ℤ` restriction is exactly what that apparatus buys. It is not
  proved here.

Merging the two would over-claim: the atomic version generalizes to every duration group and the
schema version, as currently proved anywhere, does not. Whether forward recurrence gives the full
schema over a general non-dense `D` — with "periodic" weakened to shift-recurrence under a
history-preserving order automorphism — is open, with the sum of `ℤ`/`nℤ` over `ℤ ×ₗ ℤ` as the
candidate counterexample.

## Main results

* `TaskFrame.FwdRec` — the frame condition, over bundled frames
* `validOn_atomic_density_iff_fwdRec` — the atomic correspondence, at arbitrary `D`

/-! ## The frame condition -/

/--
**Forward recurrence at covering pairs.**

Stated over a bundled `TaskFrame`, so the carrier appears only as `F.Duration` and there is no
free carrier parameter. `t < s` together with `∀ r, t < r → r < s → False` says that `s`
immediately succeeds `t`; the conclusion is the "every state property holding throughout
`(s, ∞)` already holds at `s`" form, which is the shape the density axiom instance consumes.

This is a condition on `F`'s own structure — on which total histories `F.TaskRel` allows — and
**not** a condition on `F.Duration` alone. That distinction is the whole content of the (T0)
refutation recorded in `Semantics/Correspondence/DurationFrames.lean`.

def TaskFrame.FwdRec (F : TaskFrame) : Prop :=
  ∀ (τ : F.HF) (t s : F.Duration), t < s → (∀ r, t < r → r < s → False) →
    ∀ A : F.WorldState → Prop,
      (∀ r, s < r → A (τ.val.states r (τ.property r))) → A (τ.val.states s (τ.property s))

/-! ## The atomic correspondence -/

/--
**Exact correspondence for the atomic density schema, at an arbitrary duration group.**

`F` validates every atomic instance of `GGφ → Gφ` exactly when `F` is forward-recurrent at
covering pairs. Both sides are properties of `F`; neither is a property of `F.Duration` alone.

(⇒) reads the recurrence witness off a single axiom instance, at the model whose valuation *is*
the state property `A`. (⇐) splits on whether the interval `(t, s)` is inhabited: if it is, the
axiom instance goes through on order grounds alone, and if it is not, `s` covers `t` and the
frame condition is consumed exactly there.
