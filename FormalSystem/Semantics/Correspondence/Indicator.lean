# Indicator exactness for the dense and paper-Discrete classes

`X⊤ = Formula.next Formula.top = U(⊤, ⊥)` says "the current time has an immediate successor". Its
truth clause unfolds to

```
∃ s, t < s ∧ True ∧ ∀ r, t < r → r < s → False
```

which mentions no atom: the valuation is never consulted, so `X⊤`'s frame-relative validity is a
pure order condition on the frame's duration group. Two of them, in fact, and they are the
*exact* order conditions:

* `F ⊨ ¬X⊤` iff `F.Duration` is densely ordered — `validOn_neg_nextTop_iff`;
* `F ⊨ X⊤` iff every point of `F.Duration` has an immediate successor —
  `validOn_nextTop_iff`, equivalently `F.IsDiscrete` by `validOn_nextTop_iff_isDiscrete`.

**No ordered-group homogeneity argument is involved.** `DenselyOrdered` is literally
`∀ a b, a < b → ∃ c, a < c ∧ c < b`, which is the falsity condition of `X⊤` on the nose; the
biconditional is not obtained by transporting a condition at `0` along translations.

Each of the two is an *indicator* in the sense of `Galois.galoisClosed_of_indicator`, so both
closure results below are single applications of its iff-shaped entry point
`galoisClosed_of_indicator_iff`, with no per-class argument.

## The closed and the not-closed, in one place

The two corollaries below are the **closed** half of a four-part picture; the other half lives in
`Metalogic/Independence/`, and the two halves are only intelligible together:

| Class | Closed? | Where |
|---|---|---|
| `FrameClass.Sat FrameClass.Dense` | yes | `galoisClosed_sat_dense`, below |
| `{F \| F.IsDiscrete}` (the paper's bare clause) | yes | `galoisClosed_isDiscrete`, below |
| `FrameClass.Sat FrameClass.ZTime` | **no** | `LexIntWitness.lean`'s `sat_ztime_ssubset_mod_axiomSet` |
| `FrameClass.Sat FrameClass.RTime` | **no** | `RationalWitness.lean`'s `sat_rtime_ssubset_mod_axiomSet` |

### Why the Discrete row splits

`TaskFrame.IsDiscrete` — `def:frame-properties`' bare Discrete clause, guarded by `(∃ y, x < y)` —
is the class `X⊤` indicates, and it *is* Galois-closed (`galoisClosed_isDiscrete`).

`FrameClass.Sat FrameClass.ZTime` is `TaskFrame.IsZTime`, `def:TMplus-f`'s Hölder
narrowing to ℤ-time. It is strictly stronger, and it is **not** Galois-closed —
`Metalogic/Independence/LexIntWitness.lean` exhibits a frame over `ℤ ×ₗ ℤ` inside
`Mod (AxiomSet .ZTime)` and outside it. Stating the closure corollary below over
`Sat .ZTime` would therefore contradict that witness. The corollary is over `{F | F.IsDiscrete}`
and must stay there.

The RTime row does not split the same way: `Sat .Dense` (the row that *is* closed) is the
paper's bare Dense clause, while `Sat .RTime` adds Dedekind completeness, which
`RationalWitness.lean`'s static frame over `ℚ` satisfies axiomatically without satisfying
semantically.

## Main results

* `validOn_neg_nextTop_iff` — IND-D: `¬X⊤` indicates density
* `validOn_nextTop_iff` — IND-F: `X⊤` indicates immediate successors
* `validOn_nextTop_iff_isDiscrete` — the same, against the paper's guarded predicate
* `galoisClosed_sat_dense` — `Sat .Dense` is Galois-closed
* `galoisClosed_isDiscrete` — `{F | F.IsDiscrete}` is Galois-closed

**IND-D.** `¬X⊤` is valid on `F` exactly when `F`'s duration group is densely ordered.

(⇐) is immediate: density fills every open interval, so the guard `∀ r ∈ (t, s), ⊥` can never be
met. (⇒) is the contrapositive: if some interval `(a, b)` is empty then `X⊤` is true at `a`, and
the model and history needed to witness that come from `TaskModel.allFalse` and
`TaskFrame.hF_nonempty_of_frameAxioms` — the latter wholly frame-intrinsic, so no side condition
leaks into the statement.

**IND-F.** `X⊤` is valid on `F` exactly when every point of `F`'s duration group has an
immediate successor.

This is the raw order statement, without the paper's `(∃ y, x < y)` guard;
`validOn_nextTop_iff_isDiscrete` supplies the guarded form.

**IND-F against the paper's predicate.** `X⊤` is valid on `F` exactly when `F.IsDiscrete`.

`TaskFrame.IsDiscrete` carries `def:frame-properties`' guard `(∃ y, x < y) →`, which
`validOn_nextTop_iff` does not. Discharging it is the one step past the raw statement, and it is
available because `Nontrivial` is a *field* of `TemporalOrder`: `TaskFrame.exists_pos_of_nontrivial`
supplies a positive duration `p`, so `x < x + p` witnesses the guard at every `x`. Without that
step the two conditions are inequivalent on a trivial carrier — which is exactly why the paper
writes the guard.

**The dense class is Galois-closed**: `Mod (Th (Sat .Dense)) = Sat .Dense`.

One application of `galoisClosed_of_indicator_iff` at `φ := ¬X⊤`, handed
`validOn_neg_nextTop_iff` whole — the iff entry point absorbs the split into `hmem` and `hback`
that the two-argument form would need.

`Sat .Dense` unfolds to `TaskFrame.IsDense`, which is `DenselyOrdered F.Duration`, so no
translation between the two spellings is needed. Note that no proof theory enters: that `¬X⊤` is
also `Axiom.dense_indicator` (whose `minFrameClass` is `.Dense` by `rfl`) is rhetorically apt but
plays no role in the argument.

**The paper-Discrete class is Galois-closed**: `Mod (Th {F | F.IsDiscrete}) = {F | F.IsDiscrete}`.

One application of `galoisClosed_of_indicator_iff` at `φ := X⊤`, handed
`validOn_nextTop_iff_isDiscrete` whole.

**This is `TaskFrame.IsDiscrete`, the paper's bare Discrete clause — NOT
`FrameClass.Sat FrameClass.ZTime`.** The latter is `TaskFrame.IsZTime`, the ℤ-time
narrowing, and it is *not* Galois-closed: `Metalogic/Independence/LexIntWitness.lean` exhibits a
frame over `ℤ ×ₗ ℤ` that models every `.ZTime` axiom without being successor-Archimedean.
Restating this corollary over `Sat .ZTime` would contradict that witness.
