# Witness frames for the duration-level correspondence theorems

`app:discrete`, `app:dense` and `app:complete` are the paper's three correspondence theorems,
one per frame-class clause of `def:frame-properties`. Each has a (⇐) direction that is per-frame
soundness and a (⇒) direction that needs a *witness frame over the given duration group*
refuting the axiom whenever the order condition fails. This module supplies the two witness
frames and the order-theoretic glue the second of them needs; the biconditionals themselves are
stated below them.

* **The translation frame** `translationFrame D` — `W = D`, `w ⇒_x u ⟺ u = w + x`. Deterministic,
  so its fibres are singletons and the *Saturation* argument is `ClockFrame.clockRel_saturation`'s;
  *Limit* is `TaskFrame.limit_of_shift` at the identity position function, whose docstring names
  exactly this flow-style shape as its intended use. Serves `app:discrete` and `app:complete`,
  because its total histories realize an arbitrary set of times as the truth set of an atom.
* **The permissive frame** `permissiveFrame D` — `W = Bool`, `w ⇒_d u ⟺ d ≠ 0 ∨ w = u`. Every
  state assignment whatsoever is a legal history, which is what lets it carry the one-off
  "blip" history that refutes the density schema over a non-dense carrier. Serves `app:dense`.

## Why the permissive frame needs glue, and the translation frame does not

`TaskFrame.limit_of_permissive` carries `[SuccOrder D] [NoMaxOrder D]`, and neither is available
for an arbitrary `TemporalOrder`. Both are supplied by the hypothesis under which the frame is
*used* — that `D` is **not** densely ordered:

* `NoMaxOrder D` is free from `Nontrivial` plus the ordered-group structure, via
  `TaskFrame.exists_pos_of_nontrivial` (`noMaxOrder_of_duration`);
* `SuccOrder D` comes from `Semantics.duration_dense_or_least_pos`'s non-dense branch fed into
  `SuccOrder.ofSuccLeIff (· + p)` (`succOrderOfIsLeastPos`).

Both are plain lemmas returning the structure, **not** global instances: `SuccOrder` and
`NoMaxOrder` on an arbitrary duration carrier have tree-wide elaboration surface, and the frame
constructions below need them only locally, at a `letI`.

## Statement shape: (T1), and the (T0) refutation

The three biconditionals below quantify over the **fibre** `FrameOver D`, never over bundled
frames constrained by a `Duration` equation. `FrameOver.toTaskFrame` is `@[reducible]` with
`(F.toTaskFrame).Duration = D` by `rfl`, so the fibre-quantified shape needs no transport, while
an `F.Duration = D` formulation would.

**The per-frame reading (T0) is false and must not be silently substituted.** (T0) reads
"`F ⊨ ax` iff `F` is a Discrete/Dense/Complete task frame", and its (⇒) direction fails on
degenerate frames: `FrameOver.staticFrame` over `ℤ` has constant histories, so it validates the
*whole* density schema while `ℤ` is not densely ordered. (See
`Metalogic/Independence/StaticFrame.lean`, whose `static_untl_iff_disc` makes every `untl` on
such a frame collapse to its event.) Only (T1) — "(∀ `F` over `D`, `F ⊨ ax`) iff `D` is
Discrete/Dense/Complete" — is true, and it is what the appendix proofs actually conclude. The
adjudication of record is `specs/paper-definitions-of-record.md`'s reading note on
`app:discrete`/`app:dense`/`app:complete`, from the definitional review's §2.4.

## Main results

* `translationFrame`, `permissiveFrame` — the two witness frames
* `noMaxOrder_of_duration`, `succOrderOfIsLeastPos` — the glue
* `translationHF`, `permissiveHF` — each witness frame's reference total history, bundled
* `translation_realizes`, `translation_realizes_allPast`, `translation_realizes_allFuture`,
  `permissive_realizes` — the atom-realisation step, named once instead of rebuilt inline
* `validOn_df_iff_isDiscrete`, `validOn_dn_iff_denselyOrdered`, `validOn_co_iff_isComplete` —
  the three (T1) biconditionals

/-! ## Order-theoretic glue -/

/--
A duration group has no maximum: `Nontrivial` supplies a positive element, and adding it moves
strictly upward. A plain lemma rather than a global instance — see the module docstring.
-/
theorem noMaxOrder_of_duration (D : TemporalOrder) : NoMaxOrder ↑D := by
  obtain ⟨p, hp⟩ := TaskFrame.exists_pos_of_nontrivial (D := ↑D)
  exact ⟨fun a => ⟨a + p, lt_add_of_pos_right a hp⟩⟩

/--
A least strictly positive element makes `x ↦ x + p` a successor function: `x + p ≤ y ↔ x < y`,
with (→) from `x < x + p` and (←) from `p ≤ y - x`.

Combined with `Semantics.duration_dense_or_least_pos`, this is exactly the `SuccOrder` a
*non-densely-ordered* duration group carries. A plain lemma rather than a global instance.

/-! ## The translation frame's history and model

`translationFrame` itself now lives in `Semantics/Frames/Standard.lean`; only the reference
history and the set-indexed model stay here, where the correspondence theorems below use them.
-/

/--
The translation frame's **reference history**: the identity assignment `t ↦ t`, total.

Together with a model whose valuation is the characteristic function of a set `A ⊆ D`, this
realizes `A` as the truth set of an atom — which is what makes the translation frame a witness
for the (⇒) directions of `app:discrete` and `app:complete`.

/-- The translation frame's **reference total history**, bundled as an `HF`.

This is the history every (⇒) witness below evaluates along; naming it here is what lets those
proofs mention the history once rather than rebuild the `⟨_, _⟩` pair and then carry a `hτ`
equation through every `simp only`. -/

**Atom realisation.** The translation frame realises an arbitrary `A ⊆ ↑D` as the truth set of an
atom along its reference history.

This is the step the (⇒) directions of `validOn_df_iff_isDiscrete` and `validOn_co_iff_isComplete`
turn on: pick `A`, and the atom's extension *is* `A`. Any atom does — the valuation is built from
`A`, not read off a fixed one.

`permissiveFrame` itself now lives in `Semantics/Frames/Standard.lean`; only the history and
model constructions stay here.

the task relation holds at every nonzero duration, and at duration `0` the two endpoints
coincide.

/--
**Atom realisation, permissive twin.** The permissive frame realises an arbitrary `f : ↑D → Bool`
as the truth set of an atom along its reference history.

The counterpart of `translation_realizes` for `validOn_dn_iff_denselyOrdered`, whose (⇒) witness
is the permissive frame rather than the translation frame. Without it that proof would be the
one of the three left unconverted.

      ↔ f t = true :=
  permissiveModel_atom D so nm f p t

/-! ## The three (T1) correspondence theorems

All three (⇒) directions run the same argument, and the realisation lemmas above are what make
that visible: choose the realising data (a set `A ⊆ ↑D`, or an assignment `f : ↑D → Bool`), name
its realisation as an atom's truth set (`translation_realizes` / `permissive_realizes` and their
`H`/`G` forms), build the schema's antecedent through that realisation, instantiate the
hypothesis at the witness frame, and read the consequent back through the same realisation.

The atom is `Atom.mkBase "p"` throughout. Any atom would do — the refuting valuations are built
from the chosen data rather than read off a fixed one — which is why the realisation lemmas carry
a `(p : Atom)` binder instead of this module fixing one. -/

/--
**`app:dense` at (T1).** Every frame over `D` validates the density schema `GGφ → Gφ` exactly
when `D` is densely ordered.

(⇐) is the direct semantic argument: density interpolates a point `r` between `t` and the target
`s`, and `GGφ` at `t` yields `Gφ` at `r`, which yields `φ` at `s`.

(⇒) runs the contrapositive through `duration_dense_or_least_pos`: a `D` that is not densely
ordered has a least positive element `p`, which supplies both the `SuccOrder` and the
`NoMaxOrder` that `permissiveFrame` needs. On that frame the one-off "blip" history — an atom
false at `a + p` and true everywhere else — validates `GGφ` at `a` (every time strictly above a
time strictly above `a` is strictly above `a + p`) while refuting `Gφ` there.

Note the (⇒) direction genuinely needs the permissive frame: `FrameOver.staticFrame` would *not*
serve, since its constant histories validate the whole schema over every carrier. That is the
(T0) refutation, recorded in this module's header.

**`app:discrete` at (T1).** Every frame over `D` validates the **DF** schema
`(Hφ ∧ φ ∧ F⊤) → F(Hφ)` exactly when `D` satisfies `def:frame-properties`' Discrete clause.

(⇐) is direct: the `F⊤` conjunct supplies a time strictly above `t`, discreteness turns that
into the *least* such time `y'`, and `Hφ` at `y'` holds because every `r < y'` is either below
`t` (covered by `Hφ` at `t`), equal to `t` (covered by `φ`), or strictly between — which
leastness excludes.

(⇒) uses the translation frame with the atom's truth set taken to be `{r | r ≤ x}`. The
antecedent holds at `x` by construction, so the consequent hands over a `v > x` with
`∀ r < v, r ≤ x` — which is exactly `IsLeast {z | x < z} v`.

**`app:complete` at (T1).** Every frame over `D` validates the **CO** schema
`△(Hφ → F(Hφ)) → (Hφ → Gφ)` exactly when `D` satisfies `def:frame-properties`' Complete clause.

(⇐) is the least-upper-bound argument. Suppose `Hφ` holds at `t` but `φ` fails at some `s > t`.
The set `S = {u | Hφ at u}` contains `t` and is bounded above by `s`, so it has a least upper
bound `m`; `m ∈ S`, because a time below `m` is below some member of `S` and so is covered by
that member's `Hφ`. The `△` hypothesis at `m` then produces a member of `S` strictly above `m`,
contradicting that `m` bounds `S`.

(⇒) takes the atom's truth set on the translation frame to be `{r | ∃ u ∈ S, r < u}`, the strict
down-set generated by an arbitrary nonempty bounded-above `S`. `Hφ` then holds exactly at the
times no member of whose strict past is an upper bound of `S`, and the `△` antecedent holds
*because* `S` has no least upper bound — a time at which it failed would be one. `Gφ` at a
member of `S` then forces every upper bound of `S` to lie strictly below a member of `S`, which
is a contradiction.
