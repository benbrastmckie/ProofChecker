# Walks, minimal cycles, and per-history periodicity

The apparatus behind the **schema** half of the forward-recurrence correspondence at `ℤ`.
`Semantics/Correspondence/FwdRec.lean` proves the *atomic* half at an arbitrary duration group
with no machinery at all; the full schema needs more, and this module is that more.

Two independent layers:

* **`Walk`** — pure digraph combinatorics on `ℤ → W`, mentioning no frame, no formula and no
  duration group. A *walk* is a `σ : ℤ → W` with `R (σ n) (σ (n+1))` at every `n`; `AllRec R`
  says every walk revisits, strictly later, every state it occupies. The theorem chain
  `exists_minCyc → minCyc_mem → succ_unique → det → periodic` shows that `AllRec` forces every
  walk to be **periodic**, by way of the sharper fact that it forces the digraph to be
  *deterministic along walks* (`succ_unique`: two walks agreeing at one time agree one step
  later). This is where the `ℤ` restriction lives: the argument is an induction on walk indices
  and does not survive replacing `ℤ` by an arbitrary non-dense carrier.
* **`truthAt_add_hist_period`** — truth periodicity from a **per-history** period. Contrast
  `Metalogic/Independence/LoopingDuration.truthAt_add_period`, which needs a *frame-uniform*
  period because its `□` case reaches into other histories. Here the `□` case is discharged by
  `Truth.box_time_const` instead — a boxed formula's truth value is a constant of the model — so
  a period belonging to `τ` alone suffices, with no `BoxFree` restriction.

`density_of_hist_periodic` joins the two halves at the formula level: a frame all of whose total
histories are periodic validates the **whole** density schema, at an arbitrary duration group.
The `ℤ` restriction enters only when `Semantics/Correspondence/FwdRecBridge.lean` derives that
periodicity hypothesis from `TaskFrame.FwdRec`.

## The Mathlib survey for `Walk` / `MinCyc` is **negative**, and is recorded so it is not re-run

`Walk` and `MinCyc` look like they should be Mathlib abstractions. They are not, and the search
has already been done; do not restructure them onto any of the following:

- `SimpleGraph.Walk` — finite, indexed by a list of edges, and *undirected*; a bi-infinite
  `ℤ`-indexed path in a directed relation is not an instance of it.
- `Quiver.Path` — also finite and indexed from a fixed source; no bi-infinite form.
- `Relation.ReflTransGen` — a reachability *predicate*, not a path object, so it cannot carry the
  per-index data (`walk : ℤ → W`) that `succ_unique` and `det` reason about.
- `Function.minimalPeriod` / `IsPeriodicPt` — about iterates of an endofunction `f : α → α`. The
  digraph here is a *relation*, not a function; that it turns out to be deterministic along walks
  is the conclusion (`succ_unique`), not a hypothesis available at the definition site.

What *is* taken from Mathlib is `Function.Periodic`: `per_period`, `MinCyc.perd` and `periodic`'s
conclusion are all stated in it below, so the periodicity vocabulary is shared even though the
walk vocabulary cannot be.

## Provenance

Transcribed from the frame-correspondence research probes (`03_probes.lean`),
Probes H and I, which are the compiled evidence of record. The `Walk` layer transcribes
unchanged — it never mentions a frame — and the two truth-level results are restated over
bundled `TaskFrame`s.

## Main results

* `Walk.periodic` — `AllRec` forces every walk to be `Function.Periodic`
* `Walk.succ_unique`, `Walk.det` — the determinism that periodicity rests on
* `truthAt_add_hist_period` — truth periodicity from a per-history period
* `density_of_hist_periodic` — periodic histories validate the full density schema

**Containment.** Every state a closed walk at `x` occupies lies on the minimal cycle at `x`.

The proof grafts the closed walk's periodic extension onto the *past* of the minimal cycle's
future, and reads the conclusion off `AllRec` at the grafted point.

/-! ## Per-history truth periodicity -/

/--
**Truth periodicity from a *per-history* period.**

`Metalogic.Independence.truthAt_add_period` needs a *frame-uniform* period, because its `□` case
reaches into other histories. Here the `□` case is discharged instead by `Truth.box_time_const` —
a boxed formula's truth value is a constant of the model — so a period belonging to `τ` alone
suffices, and no `BoxFree` restriction is needed.

**Why this keeps its own `induction φ` and is not a `Semantics.TruthCorr` (nor `TruthIso`)
instance.**

`Truth.truthAt_of_truthCorr` subsumes every truth transport whose reindexing is uniform across
histories — `truthAt_of_truthIso`, `TimeShift.timeShift_preserves_truth`,
`IntTransfer.truthAt_map` — and `truthAt_add_period` above is one of its instances (through
`TruthIso`). This theorem is **not**, and cannot be made one without weakening it.
`TruthCorr.atom` is quantified over *every* related pair of histories, and `TruthIso.atom` over
every total history — it has to be, because `TruthAt`'s `□` clause ranges over all of them and
the generic induction applies its hypothesis at a pair the caller did not choose. This theorem's
hypothesis `hper` is about **one** history `τ`. Supplying a `TruthCorr` would therefore mean
strengthening `hper` to a frame-uniform period, which is exactly `truthAt_add_period`'s
hypothesis and strictly stronger than what this statement assumes — and its consumer supplies
only the per-history form, obtained from `Walk.periodic` at a single walk.

The distinction is not incidental to the packaging: it is the same one the paragraph above
records, seen from the other side. A per-history period survives here **only** because the `□`
case never touches the induction hypothesis.

**Per-history periodicity suffices for the full density schema**, at an arbitrary duration group.

Note what this does *not* say: it is a sufficient condition on the frame's histories, not a
characterization, and it makes no reference to `ℤ`. The `ℤ` restriction of the schema-level
correspondence comes entirely from deriving this hypothesis out of `TaskFrame.FwdRec`, which is
what `Walk.periodic` does and what needs the walk induction.
