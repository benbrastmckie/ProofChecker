# Truth - Truth Evaluation in Task Semantics

This module defines truth evaluation for TM formulas in task models.

**Irreflexive Temporal Semantics (A2 Guard Convention)**: Temporal operators G (allFuture)
and H (allPast) use STRICT semantics (< instead of ≤), meaning "all strictly
future/past times" (excluding the present). Under irreflexive semantics, the
T-axioms (Gφ → φ, Hφ → φ) are NOT valid. Until uses strict witness (s > t) with
open guard (t, s). Since uses strict witness (s < t) with open guard (s, t).

This is the open guard convention: strict witness, open guard. The seriality
axioms (⊤ → F(⊤), ⊤ → P(⊤)) replace the T-axioms (BX1/BX1').

## Paper Specification Reference

**Bimodal Logic Semantics (`app:TaskSemantics`, `def:BL-semantics`)**:
The JPL paper defines truth evaluation for TM formulas, and this module transcribes it. The
temporal clauses are **strict** on both sides: the pinned anchor `def:BL-semantics` quantifies H
over `y < x` and G over `x < y` on the nose, so this tree matches the paper exactly rather than
refining it. (Earlier revisions of this docstring described the paper's convention as reflexive
and this tree's reading as a refinement of it; both descriptions were stale and have been
corrected against the anchor of record.)
- `M,τ,x ⊨ p` iff `τ(x) ∈ |p|` (atom satisfaction — at a possible world `τ ∈ H_F`, which is the
  only place the paper evaluates truth; there is no domain conjunct in the paper's clause)
- `M,τ,x ⊨ ⊥` is false (bottom)
- `M,τ,x ⊨ φ → ψ` iff `M,τ,x ⊨ φ` implies `M,τ,x ⊨ ψ` (implication)
- `M,τ,x ⊨ □φ` iff `M,σ,x ⊨ φ` for all σ ∈ H_F, the total histories (box: necessity)
- `M,τ,x ⊨ Past φ` iff `M,τ,y ⊨ φ` for all y ∈ D where y < x (past, strict)
- `M,τ,x ⊨ Future φ` iff `M,τ,y ⊨ φ` for all y ∈ D where x < y (future, strict)

**Critical Semantic Design (this tree's encoding; Decision A of
`specs/decisions/total-history-validity-decisions.md`)**:
`def:BL-semantics` defines truth only at possible worlds `τ ∈ H_F`, whose domain is all of `D`,
and quantifies the temporal clauses over all `y ∈ D`. This tree evaluates `TruthAt` on
**arbitrary** `ConvexHistory`s and reads the paper's clauses unchanged on them; the one place that
forces a choice is the atom clause, and the choice is:
- Atoms at times outside the domain are FALSE (not undefined). The domain conjunct is this
  tree's generalisation, not a paper clause; at a possible world it is trivially satisfied.
- Temporal operators still quantify over all of `D`, "beyond" the history's domain
- Validity (`Validity.lean`) quantifies only over total histories, so the paper's statements are
  unaffected; the generalisation matters only for finite histories used as intermediate objects
  (e.g., a chess game ending at move 31)

**ProofChecker Implementation Alignment**:
✓ Atom: `∃ (ht : τ.domain t), M.valuation (τ.states t ht) p`
  is the paper's `τ(x) ∈ |p|` plus the domain conjunct described above (atoms false outside
  the domain; trivially satisfied at a possible world)
✓ Bot: `False` matches paper's definition
✓ Imp: Standard material conditional matches paper
✓ Box: `∀ (σ : ConvexHistory F), σ.IsTotal → TruthAt M σ t φ`
  matches paper's quantification over σ ∈ H_F (the frame's total histories)
✓ Past (H): via `@[simp] past_iff`: `∀ s, s < t → TruthAt M τ s φ`
  uses strict ordering (all past times, excluding now); derived via def + Until/Since
✓ Future (G): via `@[simp] future_iff`: `∀ s, t < s → TruthAt M τ s φ`
  uses strict ordering (all future times, excluding now); derived via def + Until/Since

## Main Definitions

- `TruthAt`: Truth of a formula at a model-history-time triple
- No notation defined (parsing conflicts with validity notation)

## Main Results

- Basic truth lemmas (e.g., `bot` is always false)
- Truth evaluation examples
- Time-shift preservation theorems for temporal operators

## Simp-normal form

The `Truth.*` characterization lemmas below are the truth layer's **simp normal form**: each
rewrites a `TruthAt`-headed goal about a compound formula into the corresponding meta-level
connective, so a proof never has to unfold the `Formula.and` / `Formula.or` / `Formula.neg`
definition chain by hand. The family is confluent and terminating; twelve alternative spellings
of the same formula were each checked to converge on the normal form under bare `simp`.

| Formula | Lemma | Normal form (RHS) |
|---|---|---|
| `¬φ` | `neg_iff` | `¬ TruthAt M τ t φ` |
| `⊤` | `top_true` | `True` (the lemma is the proof, not an `Iff`) |
| `⊥` | `bot_false` | `False` |
| `φ → ψ` | `imp_iff` | `TruthAt … φ → TruthAt … ψ` |
| `φ ∧ ψ` | `and_iff` | `TruthAt … φ ∧ TruthAt … ψ` |
| `φ ∨ ψ` | `or_iff` | `TruthAt … φ ∨ TruthAt … ψ` |
| `□φ` | `box_iff` | `∀ σ, σ.IsTotal → TruthAt M σ t φ` |
| `◇φ` | `diamond_iff` | `∃ σ, σ.IsTotal ∧ TruthAt M σ t φ` |
| `ψ U φ` | `untl_iff` | the `untl` clause |
| `ψ S φ` | `snce_iff` | the `snce` clause |
| `Fφ` | `some_future_iff` | `∃ s, t < s ∧ TruthAt M τ s φ` |
| `Pφ` | `some_past_iff` | `∃ s, s < t ∧ TruthAt M τ s φ` |
| `Gφ` | `future_iff` | `∀ s, t < s → TruthAt M τ s φ` |
| `Hφ` | `past_iff` | `∀ s, s < t → TruthAt M τ s φ` |
| `△φ` | `always_iff` | `∀ s, TruthAt M τ s φ` |
| `K⁺φ` | `kPlus_iff` | `∀ s, t < s → ∃ r, t < r ∧ r < s ∧ TruthAt M τ r φ` |
| `K⁻φ` | `kMinus_iff` | `∀ s, s < t → ∃ r, s < r ∧ r < t ∧ TruthAt M τ r φ` |
| `M(φ,ψ)` | `strong_release_iff` | the `untl` clause with a nested `and` |
| `ST(φ,ψ)` | `strong_trigger_iff` | the `snce` clause with a nested `and` |

All of the above are tagged into the `truth_norm` simp set declared in
`FormalSystem/Automation/TruthNormAttr.lean`, alongside `TruthAt`'s own defining equations, so
`simp only [truth_norm]` — or equivalently the `truth_simp` macro — opens the whole family at
once.

**`always` has two forms, and only one may carry the attribute.** `always_iff` (the collected
`∀ s` form) is the normal form and is the tagged one. `always_iff_tri` (the three-conjunct
past/present/future form, mirroring `MinusTruth.always_iff`) is the **introduction** form and is
deliberately left plain. The two are logically equivalent but syntactically distinct, so tagging
both makes `simp` apply whichever was declared first and silently strand every proof written
against the other; that failure was reproduced rather than merely anticipated. Build an `always`
with `always_iff_tri`, eliminate one with `always_iff`.

**A caveat when rewriting an existing `simp only` list.** Adding these names to a list that still
mentions `Formula.and` / `Formula.or` / `Formula.neg` is a no-op: simp rewrites bottom-up, so the
syntax-unfolding lemmas fire on the argument before the `TruthAt`-headed characterization lemma
can match. The syntax lemmas have to come **out** of the list as the characterization lemmas go
in.

## Note on Bridge Theorems

The bridge theorems connecting the proof system to semantics — the temporal-duality
infrastructure — live under `Metalogic/SoundnessLemmas/`, not here, so that this module depends
on no proof-system notion.

## Implementation Notes

- Truth is defined recursively on 6 formula constructors (atom, bot, imp, box, untl, snce)
- Modal box quantifies over all possible worlds at current time
- Until/Since use strict witness (s > t / s < t) with open guards (t,s) / (s,t)
- G/H/F/P are `def` abbreviations with `@[simp]` characterization theorems
- Atoms are false at times outside the history's domain

/--
Truth of a formula at a model-history-time triple.

Given:
- `M`: A task model (frame + valuation)
- `τ`: A convex history (function from times to states)
- `t`: A time point
- `φ`: A formula

Returns whether `φ` is true at this semantic configuration.

The evaluation is defined recursively on formula structure (6 constructors):
- Atoms: true iff there exists a proof that t is in the history's domain
  AND valuation says so at current state (atoms are false at times outside domain)
- Bot (⊥): always false
- Implication: standard material conditional
- Box (□): true iff φ true at all **possible worlds** at time t
- Until `φ U ψ`: ∃ s > t, ψ(s) ∧ ∀ r ∈ (t,s), φ(r) (guard φ first, event ψ second)
- Since `φ S ψ`: ∃ s < t, ψ(s) ∧ ∀ r ∈ (s,t), φ(r) (guard φ first, event ψ second)

G (allFuture), H (allPast), F (someFuture), P (somePast) are `def` abbreviations
with `@[simp]` characterization theorems (see `future_iff`, `past_iff`, etc.).

**Paper Reference**: `def:BL-semantics`'s box clause, verbatim: "M,τ,x ⊨ □φ *iff* M,σ,x ⊨ φ
for all σ ∈ H_F". The quantifier ranges over `H_F` — the TOTAL histories — with no `Ω` and no
shift-closure side condition. `ConvexHistory.IsTotal` is the predicate form of `H_F` membership
(Decision A of `specs/decisions/total-history-validity-decisions.md`); it is deliberately **not**
Mathlib's `IsMax` or any order-theoretic maximality predicate.

**There is no admissible-history parameter.** `TruthAt` takes the model, the history, the time
and the formula, and nothing else. The designated-carrier argument that earlier revisions
threaded through every clause has been deleted outright: the box clause reads its quantifier
range off `ConvexHistory.IsTotal`, so no set-valued parameter can narrow, widen, or otherwise
influence the meaning of any connective.

**Atom clause** (Decision A, accepted gap): the `∃ (ht : τ.domain t)` conjunct is retained even
though `def:BL-semantics`'s atom clause has no domain conjunct. Under totality the conjunct is
vacuously satisfiable at every `t`, so the two readings agree on `H_F`; the conjunct is what keeps
`TruthAt` meaningful at the partial histories that the extension machinery still traffics in.

**Until / Since argument order**: `untl`/`snce` are **guard-first / event-second** — `untl ψ φ`
reads "ψ is the guard, φ is the event". The two clauses below transcribe
`def:BL-semantics`'s clause bodies directly:

- (since) "M,τ,x ⊨ φ since ψ *iff* M,τ,z ⊨ ψ for some time z < x where M,τ,y ⊨ φ for all y ∈ D
  with z < y < x."
- (until) "M,τ,x ⊨ φ until ψ *iff* M,τ,z ⊨ ψ for some time z > x where M,τ,y ⊨ φ for all y ∈ D
  with x < y < z."

In both, the existential witness is the **second** argument and the universally quantified
open-interval condition is the **first**. `def:BLplus-language` corroborates independently:
`past φ := ⊤ since φ`, `future φ := ⊤ until φ`, `Next φ := ⊥ until φ`, `Previous φ := ⊥ since φ`
— in each the operand is the event and sits second. `Formula.someFuture φ = untl ⊤ φ` and
`Formula.next φ = untl ⊥ φ` match character for character.

**Anchor provenance.** These clauses used to live under `def:BLplus-semantics`, a separate
definition for the separate language `BL^+`. The paper's 2026-09 wave collapsed `BL^+` into `BL`
and made the since/until clauses clauses of `def:BL-semantics` itself, deleting the old label —
which `specs/paper-definitions-of-record.md` now records `DANGLING`. The clause bodies quoted
above are word-for-word what the live `def:BL-semantics` carries; only their home moved. The same
wave moved the defined operators into `def:BLplus-language`'s own block (that anchor id is
unchanged), retiring `def:BLplus-defined` likewise.

Earlier revisions of this docstring quoted an argument-order **footnote** of the then-`BL^+`
semantics anchor and asserted that the Lean tree was deliberately event-first. Both are
retired: the tracked anchor carries no footnote, and the tree was aligned
to the paper by a uniform argument swap of the definition and every call site. See
`specs/decisions/untl-snce-argument-order.md`. These clauses are τ-local and are untouched by the
box retarget.

L's instances of `Semantics/TruthClauses.lean`. The environment is trivial (`PUnit`), since
`TruthAt` evaluates at `(M, τ, t)` alone; every clause field is `Iff.rfl` or `fun h => h`, which
is the compiler checking that `TruthAt`'s six clauses really do have the shared shapes. The
derived-operator lemmas below then delegate to the generic ones. -/

these four the only way to reason about a conjunction is to unfold the definition chain by hand

this family retires. -/

`untl_iff` and `snce_iff` restate `TruthAt`'s own `untl`/`snce` equations as biconditionals. They
look redundant next to `simp only [TruthAt]`, and they are not: once the characterization family
is the normal form, a proof no longer opens `TruthAt` at all, so a raw `untl`/`snce` head would
have nothing to reduce it. These two are what keep the family complete on the primitives. Both
are guard-first / event-second, matching `TruthAt`. -/

/-! ### Temporal `always`

**Only one of the two `always` characterizations may ever carry `@[simp]`.** They are logically
equivalent but syntactically distinct normal forms, so tagging both makes `simp` apply whichever
was declared first and silently strand every proof written against the other — a failure that was
reproduced, not hypothesised. The **collected `∀ s` form, `always_iff`, is the normal form** and
is the one that carries the attribute. `always_iff_tri` is the three-conjunct introduction form
that mirrors `MinusTruth.always_iff` and is the proof route to the collected form; it is deliberately
plain, and must stay untagged by both `@[simp]` and `@[truth_norm]`. -/

/-- Truth of `△φ` (`Hφ ∧ (φ ∧ Gφ)`) in three-conjunct form: past, present, future.

The **introduction** form — this is the shape you build an `always` from, and the association
mirrors `Formula.always` and `MinusTruth.always_iff`. It is **not** the simp normal form and must
never be tagged; see the section note above. Use `always_iff` for elimination. -/

/-! ## Truth correspondences — the generic relational transport

`TruthCorr` is the data of a truth-preserving correspondence between two task models, and
`Truth.truthAt_of_truthCorr` is the one `induction φ` that discharges it. This is the paper's own
proof shape. `lem:history-time-shift-preservation` — its `□` case in particular — never uses a
bijection between histories: it uses a *relation* between them (`def:time-shift-histories`),
atomic agreement on related pairs, and the existence of a related possible world in each
direction (`app:auto_existence`). `TruthCorr` asks for exactly those three things and nothing
more.

### Why a relation and not an `Equiv`

The paper's proof consumes existence in both directions and never injectivity or round-trip
cancellation, so an equivalence would be strictly more data than the induction spends. More
importantly, an `Equiv` on `ConvexHistory` itself is a trap: `states` is indexed by a proof of
`domain`, so round-tripping two history transports forces a dependent structure equality and
degenerates into `HEq` — the failure `IntTransfer.lean`'s "Design decision: `Aligned`, not
`Equiv`" section records. A `Prop`-valued `Rel` on arbitrary histories has no round trip to
cancel. Every instance in the tree (`TruthIso.toCorr`, `TimeShift.shiftCorr`,
`IntTransfer`'s `alignedCorr`) states its relation on arbitrary `ConvexHistory`s, which is what
lets `TimeShift.timeShift_preserves_truth` and `IntTransfer.truthAt_map` keep their
arbitrary-history statements while being derived from a single induction.

`TruthIso` (below, after the time-shift section) is the total-only, bijective special case:
`TruthIso.toCorr` reads an equivalence `F.HF ≃ F'.HF` as the relation "`hist` sends the one to
the other", and `truthAt_of_truthIso` is `truthAt_of_truthCorr` at that instance.

**A truth correspondence between two task models.**

Field by field against the paper:
- `dur`: times reindex by an order isomorphism — order preservation is what `untl`/`snce` need.
- `Rel`: the correspondence relation on **arbitrary** histories — the relation of
  `def:time-shift-histories`, read on histories rather than only on possible worlds.
- `atom`: atomic truth agrees at every related pair — the base case of
  `lem:history-time-shift-preservation`. Because `TruthAt`'s atom clause carries the domain
  conjunct, this field absorbs the domain transport as well. It is quantified over every related
  pair, not one distinguished history, because the `□` case applies the induction hypothesis at a
  pair the caller did not choose.
- `total_fwd` / `total_bwd`: every possible world on either side is related to some possible
  world on the other — `app:auto_existence` in the two directions the `□` case of
  `lem:history-time-shift-preservation` uses.

**The generic truth transport, relational form.**

One `induction φ` over `Formula`'s six constructors, discharging every transport a `TruthCorr`
can express. Every order-preserving truth transport in `Semantics/` is an instance of it
(`truthAt_of_truthIso`, `TimeShift.timeShift_preserves_truth`, `IntTransfer.truthAt_map`); the
only other generic induction is the time-reversal twin `truthAt_of_truthAntiIso`.

The body is the former `truthAt_of_truthIso` induction with `I.hist.surjective` in the `□` case
replaced by `I.total_bwd` (forward direction) and `I.total_fwd` (backward direction) — the two
halves of `app:auto_existence`. The `untl` and `snce` cases spend `dur`'s surjectivity on the
guard's bounded quantifier and `OrderIso.lt_iff_lt` in both directions on the bounds. Written
against the `truth_norm` characterisation lemmas (`imp_iff`, `box_iff`, `untl_iff`, `snce_iff`)
rather than `simp only [TruthAt]`, which is what keeps it short.

/-! ## Time-Shift Preservation

Truth is preserved under time shift: for a formula `φ`,
`TruthAt M σ y φ ↔ TruthAt M (timeShift σ (y - x)) x φ`. This is the semantic engine behind the
MF and TF axioms' validity.

The theorem is `Truth.truthAt_of_truthCorr` at the instance `shiftCorr`: `ShiftRel Δ` is the
relation of `def:time-shift-histories` read on arbitrary histories, and `shiftCorr`'s
`total_fwd`/`total_bwd` are `app:auto_existence` ("total since 𝔇 is a group", i.e.
`ConvexHistory.isTotal_timeShift`). No six-case induction lives in this section; the one that
used to is the relational transport's, run once.

**Time shift is a truth correspondence** of `M` with itself: times reindex by `· + Δ`, histories
by `ShiftRel Δ`. `total_fwd` and `total_bwd` are `app:auto_existence` — every possible world has
a shifted possible world in each direction, `ConvexHistory.isTotal_timeShift` supplying totality
— and `atom` is the pointwise domain/state agreement unfolded at one time.

`dur` must be `OrderIso.addRight Δ` itself. A hand-built `{ toEquiv := Equiv.addRight Δ, … }`
elaborates, but leaves an unreduced `let` in `dur t` that blocks `rw` on `states` at every use
site of the transport.

Time-shift preserves truth of formulas.

If σ is a history and Δ = y - x, then truth at (σ, y) equals truth at (timeShift σ Δ, x).

**Paper Reference**: `lem:history-time-shift-preservation`. The paper states the lemma for
possible worlds `τ, σ ∈ H_F`; this theorem is Lean-stronger, holding for an arbitrary `σ`, and
the extra generality is free because `ShiftRel` is pointwise and never needs totality of the
history being shifted. Every live consumer passes a total history; the `H_F` form is
`timeShift_preserves_truth_total` below.

**Proof**: `Truth.truthAt_of_truthCorr` at `shiftCorr M (y - x)` on the related pair
`(σ.timeShift (y - x), σ)`, then `x + (y - x) = y`. The final step is a `change` followed by
`rw [add_sub_cancel]`: `simpa` does not normalise `(OrderIso.addRight Δ) x` to `x + Δ`.

**Key Insight**: **no shift-closure hypothesis is required.** Under the totality box clause the
shifted history's membership in the quantifier's range is `ConvexHistory.isTotal_timeShift`,
definitionally `fun t => hρ (t + Δ)` — there is no closure condition left to assume, so this
statement is strictly stronger than the shift-closure-hypothesised version it replaces.

## `□` is a model constant

The box clause quantifies over *all* total histories at a time. Under time-homogeneity of the task
relation that makes its truth value depend on neither the history nor the time — a boxed formula is
a fact about the model alone.

This block is placed after `TimeShift` rather than beside the other `Truth` clause lemmas because
its proof consumes `TimeShift.timeShift_preserves_truth`, which is declared there.
-/

/--
**A boxed formula's truth value is a constant of the model**: it depends on neither the history nor
the time.

Two very different reasons combine, and the docstring separates them deliberately so that neither
is over-engineered in the proof:

- **History-independence is definitional.** `def:BL-semantics`'s box clause is
  `∀ σ, σ.IsTotal → TruthAt M σ t φ` — it simply does not mention `τ`. Nothing has to be proved.
- **Time-independence is the substantive half**, and it is exactly time-homogeneity: given a total
  `ρ` at which `φ` is wanted at `s`, the `(s - t)`-shift of `ρ` is total
  (`ConvexHistory.isTotal_timeShift`) and is covered by the hypothesis at `t`, and
  `TimeShift.timeShift_preserves_truth` transports the result back.

The `IsTotal` hypotheses on `τ` and `σ` are stated because that is the setting the result is used
in, but they are **not consumed**: the statement holds for arbitrary histories, precisely because
of the definitional half above.

This is what makes the box case of a finite-model truth lemma routine rather than the hardest
clause: the set of total histories over a finite carrier is still uncountable, but the box
*predicate* is constant on it, so a model has one finite set of box facts, computed once.

/-! ## A-17: history-independence and the gap formula

The four uniformity axioms and the discrete box-necessity axiom all say the same thing twice
over: the formula they quantify is *atom-free*, so its truth cannot depend on the history at all,
and the particular atom-free formula they use — `⊥ U (⊥ → ⊥)` — says only that the temporal order
has a gap immediately above the point, which is a statement about `F.Duration` and nothing else.
Both facts are proved once here, so the soundness proofs that consume them collapse to one term
each instead of re-deriving the translation argument five times over. -/

/-- **Truth of an atom-free formula does not depend on the history.**

The `box` case is where this is not merely an induction bookkeeping step: `def:BL-semantics`'s box
clause quantifies over *all* total histories and does not mention `τ`, so the two sides are
definitionally equal there and the induction hypothesis is not needed. Every other case is
congruence. The atom case is vacuous — `(Formula.atom p).atoms = {p} ≠ ∅`. -/

/-! ## Truth isomorphisms — the bijective special case

`TruthIso` is the total-only, bijective special case of `TruthCorr`: times reindex by an order
isomorphism and **total** histories reindex by an equivalence `F.HF ≃ F'.HF`. It is the packaging
`Independence/LoopingDuration.lean`'s duration reindexings naturally come in, and it is kept as a
structure in its own right for them. It is not a second induction: `TruthIso.toCorr` reads
`hist` as the relation "`hist` sends the one to the other", and `truthAt_of_truthIso` is
`truthAt_of_truthCorr` at that instance.

### Why `hist` is an equivalence

The paper needs existence in both directions (`app:auto_existence`): the `□` case of the
transport must produce, for an arbitrary possible world of `F'`, a possible world of `F` to feed
the hypothesis, and conversely. `TruthCorr.total_fwd`/`total_bwd` ask for exactly that, and an
`Equiv` supplies it — the map itself in one direction, `Equiv.surjective` in the other. Nothing
finer than the two existence facts is spent, which is why the relational `TruthCorr` is the
primitive and this structure the special case.

### Why `atom` is quantified over all histories

The `atom` field has to hold at every `τ : F.HF`, not at one distinguished history, because the
`box` case applies the induction hypothesis at a history the caller did not choose. A per-history
atom hypothesis would not survive the box case — which is precisely why
`Correspondence/FwdRecPeriodicity.truthAt_add_hist_period` is **not** an instance of this
structure, nor of `TruthCorr`, and keeps its own induction; see its docstring.

/--
**A truth isomorphism between two task models.**

`dur` reindexes times by an order isomorphism, `hist` reindexes total histories by an
equivalence, and `atom` says the two models agree on atomic truth under that reindexing. The
three together are exactly what `TruthIso.toCorr` needs to build a `TruthCorr`: `dur` is
passed through, `hist` and its surjectivity supply `total_fwd`/`total_bwd`, and `atom` supplies
`atom` (with `atom_iff_of_domain` discharging the domain conjunct on both sides).

itself, `total_bwd` is `hist.surjective`, and `atom` is the structure's `atom` field with the
domain conjunct on each side discharged by `atom_iff_of_domain` from totality.

`truthAt_of_truthCorr`; nothing is re-run here. Statement unchanged from the days it carried its

/-! ## The anti-isomorphism twin

`TruthIso` transports truth along an *order-preserving* reindexing of time. A time **reversal**
is order-reversing, so it cannot be one — and the formula it transports to is not `φ` but
`φ.swapTemporal`, since reversing time exchanges `untl` with `snce`. `TruthAntiIso` is that
twin, and `truthAt_of_truthAntiIso` its generic lemma.

`Formula.swapTemporal` (`Syntax/Formula.lean`) fixes `atom` and `bot`, distributes through `imp`
and `box`, and exchanges `untl` with `snce` — exactly the six-case shape the twin's induction
needs, one clause per constructor with no residue.
-/

/--
**An anti-isomorphism between two task models**: `TruthIso` with time reversed.

`dur` is a bare `Equiv` plus an explicit reversal condition rather than an
`F.Duration ≃o (F'.Duration)ᵒᵈ`. The two carry the same content, and the `≃o`-into-the-dual
spelling would force every use site to insert `OrderDual.toDual`/`ofDual` round trips into
statements that are otherwise about the carrier itself.

`hist` and `atom` are unchanged from `TruthIso`, and for the same reasons: the `box` clause of
`TruthAt` is time-symmetric, so reversal does not touch it, and it still ranges over all total
histories — which is what forces `hist` to be an equivalence and `atom` to be quantified over
every history.

/--
**The generic truth transport across an anti-isomorphism.**

The order-reversing twin of `truthAt_of_truthCorr` (at the `TruthIso` instance), concluding at
`φ.swapTemporal`. Its `atom`,
`bot`, `imp` and `box` cases are the same arguments, since `swapTemporal` is the identity on the
first two and structural on the second two; only `untl` and `snce` differ, and they differ by
exchanging places and reading every bound through `dur_rev` instead of `OrderIso.lt_iff_lt`.

Note on `swap_norm`: the plan for this work specified writing the body against that simp set.
`swap_norm` collects the eleven `Formula.swap_temporal_*` lemmas, which push `swapTemporal`
through the **derived** operators (`neg`, `diamond`, `someFuture`, `next`, …). A six-constructor
induction needs the *base* equations of `Formula.swapTemporal` instead, and those are not in the
set — nor should they be, since adding them would make `swap_norm` unfold the definition at every
call site. `simp only [Formula.swapTemporal, …]` is therefore what the base cases use; `swap_norm`
remains the right tool for a caller reasoning about a derived operator.
