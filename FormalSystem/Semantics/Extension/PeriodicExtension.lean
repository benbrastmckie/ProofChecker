# Periodic Extension over a Finite Carrier

The Extension Theorem says every partial history extends to a possible world, and it gets there
through Zorn's lemma: a maximal element of the extension order, produced non-constructively, with
no description of the world it names. Over ℤ-time with a **finite** carrier that is more than is
needed. A bounded history has two orbits leaving it — one forward, one backward — and a finite
carrier forces each to revisit a state, so the extension can be taken **doubly ultimately
periodic**, with both periods bounded by the number of world states.

That is what this module proves. It **strengthens** the finite discrete case; it does not replace
the general theorem, which stands exactly as it is for arbitrary `W` and `D`, and which this
module neither imports nor mentions in any proof.

## No seriality hypothesis, and that is deliberate

The informal statement of this result says "with a serial relation". No such hypothesis appears
below, because *Seriality* is already a **field** of `FrameOver`: `FrameOver.serial` instantiated
at duration `x = 1` yields forward and backward one-step seriality at once, which is exactly what
`exists_iter_fwd` and `exists_iter_bwd` consume. Adding a hypothesis would duplicate a field and
diverge from the frame-intrinsic discipline the extension results are written in. Read the absence
as discharged, not as omitted.

## Relation to the effective, certificate-bearing counterpart

`FormalSystem.Metalogic.Decidability.IntPresentation.extend_periodic` proves a companion result
whose conclusion is a **finite object**: three lists of states plus an integer origin, with
coherence decidable, which a model checker can emit and a consumer re-verify.

These are two theorems, not one, and deliberately so. `Finite` is a non-constructive `Prop`: it
asserts that a bijection with some `Fin n` exists without producing one, so it yields no
enumeration and cannot drive a computation. `IntPresentation` is *data*. No bridge from the first
to the second is written anywhere, because extracting an equivalence to `Fin n` out of a
`Prop`-level existential — together with decidability of a `Prop`-valued relation — is
`Classical.choice` in its most literal role, and would produce a non-computable presentation,
destroying precisely the property the effective version exists to obtain. The theorem below is
proved **directly**, with no presentation appearing anywhere in it.

### The scope of that objection

Read the paragraph above as what it is: a claim about **emitting an evaluable certificate**. In
that setting a `Classical.choice`-produced `IntPresentation` really is worthless, because the whole
point of the object is that it compute, and one obtained by extraction does not.

The objection does **not** transfer to a setting where the classically produced presentation is
only *quantified over* and never evaluated — as in a statement of the form
`¬ ValidZTime φ → ∃ P ∈ cands φ, ∃ w, SatAtState P w φ.neg`, where the decision procedure ranges
over its own independently constructed `cands φ` and never sees the `P` the existence proof
produced. There, `Classical.choice` sits in the proof *about* the data and computability survives
it; `Decidability/BiLasso/Check.lean`'s `instDecidableSatAtState` is the worked instance —
kernel-evaluable, yet measuring `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

There is a second and sharper reason it cannot bite there. `Fin n → Fin n → Bool` is a `Fintype`
with `DecidableEq`, so a `step` function defined via `Classical.dec` is nonetheless **equal** to
one of the finitely many enumerable functions of that type. A classically constructed presentation
is thereby automatically captured by a computable enumeration of the presentations of the same
`card`: the existential and the enumeration meet, and no extraction ever happens. What genuinely
does not work is enumerating at a **cardinality bound**, because `IntPresentation.val` is a
function on the `Infinite` type `Atom` — see `IntPresentation.lean`.

Both points are compiled rather than argued:
`decidability-assembly-family-probe.lean`, in the bridge-filtration elimination evidence set,
elaborates the assembly sorry-free at `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`, alongside
`soundness-half-probe.lean` and the single-presentation variant
`decidability-assembly-probe.lean`. None of this weakens the objection where it applies; it fixes
where that is.

## Main Results

- `FormalSystem.Semantics.exists_repeat_of_card_le` — pigeonhole on a window of `Nat.card W`
  consecutive times
- `FrameOver.extend_periodic` — the extension theorem for a finite carrier over ℤ, with both
  periods bounded by `Nat.card`

## Pigeonhole at the sharp threshold

A window of `Nat.card W + 1` consecutive times — that is, of `Nat.card W` *steps* — already
repeats a state, so the repeat's span is at most `Nat.card W`. This is the threshold the periods
in `FrameOver.extend_periodic` are bounded by, and it is one tighter than the strict-inequality
form of the same pigeonhole gives, which yields a span of `Nat.card W + 1`. Adjacency plays no
role in either; the statement is about a bare function on ℤ, and saying so keeps it reusable.

**Periodic extension over a finite carrier.**

A partial history whose domain is exactly the integer interval `[a, b]` extends to a possible
world that is ultimately periodic in *both* directions, with both periods bounded by the number of
world states: some `n₁` past which the world repeats with period `p₁`, and some `n₀` before which
it repeats with period `p₀`.

The construction is the one the informal argument describes. Seriality — taken from
`FrameOver.serial` at duration `1`, through `exists_iter_fwd` and `exists_iter_bwd` — supplies a
successor and a predecessor at every state. Iterating them out of the two ends of the window gives
two orbits; finiteness forces each to revisit a state (`exists_repeat_of_card_le`), which makes it
periodic from that visit onward; and `FrameOver.HFofStepPath` turns the resulting bi-infinite walk
into a genuine element of `H_F`, discharging the all-pairs task-respect obligation from adjacency
alone.

No `IntPresentation` appears here, and none can: see this module's docstring on why the effective
counterpart is a separate theorem rather than a corollary.

## The gapped case

`PartialHistory.domain` is an arbitrary predicate, so `{0, 5}` is a legal domain with a four-time
hole. The paper's own hypothesis is a *bounded world history*, which carries a `convex` field and
so has no holes; the statement below drops convexity and asks only that the domain be finite.

The extra work is entirely bookkeeping: order the domain, and between each consecutive pair fill
the gap with an explicit path of exactly the right length, which `respects_task` plus
`taskRel_eq_iter` plus `exists_path_of_iter` supply. Once the holes are filled the domain is an
interval and `FrameOver.extend_periodic` finishes the job.

**This is delivered at the frame level only.** There is no gapped counterpart on the effective,
certificate-bearing side, and there cannot be one built this way: `exists_path_of_iter` yields a
`Prop`-level existential filler, so a gapped certificate assembled from it would not be *data*,
which is the entire point of that tier. Producing a computable filler would need a bounded path
search over a presentation's adjacency matrix — real work, deliberately out of scope here, and
recorded as follow-up rather than quietly omitted.

**Gap filling.** Given a partial history and a finite set `S` of its domain points all lying
strictly after a domain point `a`, there is a single function on ℤ adjacent at every step from `a`
up to some `M` bounding `S`, agreeing with the history at `a` and at every member of `S`.

The induction is on `S.card`, peeling off the largest member and joining it to the previous
frontier with an explicit path of exactly the right length.
