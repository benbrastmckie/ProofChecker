# `lem:constraint`: the constraint family is directed and nonempty

This module proves the Constraint Lemma in its **restructured** form: the constraints a partial
history imposes on a new duration form a *directed* family of *nonempty* sets. That is the whole
of the lemma. The admissibility characterization that the lemma's earlier merged statement
carried has been split out by the paper into `lem:admissible`, warranted by `lem:fibers` (a
RETIRED paper anchor — `\label{lem:fibers}` was later removed and the citation now resolves
against the record's DANGLING entry), and is
deliberately **not** folded back in here.

## Paper Specification Reference

Anchors are `\label` keys into `specs/paper-definitions-of-record.md`, which — not the paper
source — is the citation source of record.

- `lem:constraint` (verbatim): "For any partial history $\tau : X \to W$ over a frame
  $\F = \tuple{W, \D, \Rightarrow}$ and duration $z \in D \setminus X$, the constraints imposed on
  $z$ form a directed family of nonempty sets."
- `def:constraints` (verbatim): "For a partial history $\tau : X \to W$ over a frame
  $\F = \tuple{W, \D, \Rightarrow}$ and duration $z \in D \setminus X$, the \textit{constraints
  imposed on $z$} are the segments $[\tau(t), \tau(s)]_{z-t}^{s-z}$ for times $t,s \in X$ where
  $t < z < s$, and the fibers $\Fib(\tau(t), z - t)$ for $t \in X$ otherwise."
- `def:frame`'s opening clause (verbatim): "Letting a nonempty family of sets $\mathcal{S}$ be
  \textit{$\supseteq$-directed} just in case $S \subseteq S_1 \cap S_2$ for some
  $S \in \mathcal{S}$ whenever $S_1, S_2 \in \mathcal{S}$". **Retired anchor**: this was the
  standalone `def:directed` until the paper's 2026-09 wave folded it inline into `def:frame` and
  deleted the label, which `specs/paper-definitions-of-record.md` now records `DANGLING`. The
  condition itself is unchanged.
- *Seriality* (`def:frame#Seriality`, verbatim): "$w \Rightarrow_x u$ and $v \Rightarrow_x w$ for
  some $u, v \in W$."
- *Compositionality* (`def:frame#Compositionality`, verbatim): "$w \Rightarrow_{x + y} v$ if and
  only if $w \Rightarrow_x u$ and $u \Rightarrow_y v$ for some $u \in W$."

## Which axioms this consumes

`PartialHistory.constraint`'s proof consumes exactly three things, and the reader can check the
§7-style threading for each:

1. **`Serial`** (`hSer`) — nonemptiness of every *fiber* member. At a domain time `t ≤ z` this is
   the successor half of *Seriality* at `z - t ≥ 0`; at `t ≥ z` it is the predecessor half at
   `t - z ≥ 0`, converted by the converse convention.
2. **`Interpolates`** (`hInt`) — nonemptiness of every *segment* member. This is the
   left-to-right half of biconditional *Compositionality*: the history's own task-respect gives
   `τ(t) ⇒_{s-t} τ(s)`, and interpolating at `z` splits `s - t = (z - t) + (s - z)` into a point
   of `[τ(t), τ(s)]_{z-t}^{s-z}`.
3. **`TaskFrame.forward_comp`** — *directedness*, via the two fiber-monotonicity lemmas below.
   This is the right-to-left (composition) half of the same biconditional axiom, so
   *Compositionality* is consumed in **both** directions by this one lemma.

The `z ∉ dom τ` proviso of `def:constraints` (the paper's `z ∈ D \ X`) is **not** needed for this
lemma and is therefore not assumed: when `z` does lie in the domain, the fiber `Fib(τ(z), 0)` is
itself a constraint and is contained in every other constraint, so directedness holds a fortiori.
That is the `fib_zero_subset_of_mem_Constraints` branch below.

## Main Results

- `PartialHistory.constraint` — `lem:constraint`: the constraint family is directed, and each of
  its members is nonempty

## Supporting Results

- `PartialHistory.seg_eq_inter_fib` — a constraint segment is the intersection of its two fiber
  conditions, with `def:task-relation`'s `-y` offset normalized to `z - s`
- `PartialHistory.fib_subset_fib_of_le_of_le` / `fib_subset_fib_of_le_of_le'` — fiber
  monotonicity below and above `z`: the constraint imposed by a domain time *nearer* `z` is the
  tighter one
- `PartialHistory.fib_zero_subset` / `fib_zero_subset_of_mem_Constraints` — when `z` is itself a
  domain time, its own fiber is the tightest constraint of all
- `PartialHistory.seg_subset_seg` — segment monotonicity in both endpoints
- `PartialHistory.nonempty_fib_of_serial` / `nonempty_seg_of_interpolates` — the two
  member-nonemptiness cases
- `PartialHistory.nonempty_Constraints` — the family itself is nonempty (part of the
  `⊇`-directed condition of `def:frame`'s opening clause)
- `PartialHistory.exists_mem_subset_inter` — the directedness step proper

## Implementation Notes

- **No new definition is introduced.** Everything is stated with `TaskFrame.Fib`, `TaskFrame.Seg`,
  `TaskFrame.DirectedFamily`, and `PartialHistory.Constraints` exactly as already transcribed.
- **Fibers and segments stay two separate classes.** The case analysis below is driven by
  `Constraints`' own two clauses, never by a merged class.
- **The `def:constraints` "otherwise" reading is consumed, not re-decided.** A fiber member's
  `¬ IsPaired τ z t` hypothesis is what rules out the mixed fiber/segment configurations: if a
  segment `[τ(t₁), τ(s₁)]` exists then every domain time other than `z` itself is paired, so the
  only fiber that can coexist with a segment is `Fib(τ(z), 0)`.

### Rewriting a constraint segment as a pair of fiber conditions
-/

/--
A constraint segment is the intersection of the two fiber conditions at its endpoints.

`def:task-relation`'s *Segment* clause is `[w, v]_x^y = Fib(w, x) ∩ Fib(v, -y)`; for the
constraint segment `[τ(t), τ(s)]_{z-t}^{s-z}` the second offset `-(s - z)` normalizes to `z - s`,
which is the same shape as the fiber constraint `Fib(τ(s), z - s)` that the time `s` imposes.
This normalization is what lets the monotonicity lemmas below apply uniformly to fibers and to
segment endpoints.
-/

  simp only [TaskFrame.Seg, neg_sub]

/-!
### Fiber monotonicity: constraints tighten as the domain time approaches `z`
-/

/--
Below `z`, a later domain time imposes a tighter constraint: for `a ≤ b ≤ z` in the domain,
`Fib(τ(b), z - b) ⊆ Fib(τ(a), z - a)`.

This is *Compositionality*'s composition half (`TaskFrame.forward_comp`) applied to the history's
own task-respect step `τ(a) ⇒_{b-a} τ(b)`, with both durations `b - a` and `z - b` nonnegative so
that the axiom's positive-cone proviso is met.

/--
Above `z`, an earlier domain time imposes a tighter constraint: for `z ≤ b ≤ a` in the domain,
`Fib(τ(b), z - b) ⊆ Fib(τ(a), z - a)`.

The mirror image of `fib_subset_fib_of_le_of_le`. Both fiber durations are now nonpositive, so
the composition is performed on the reflected pair — `u ⇒_{b-z} τ(b)` and `τ(b) ⇒_{a-b} τ(a)` —
and the converse convention (`FrameOver.converse`) carries the result back.

Segment monotonicity: shrinking a constraint segment's endpoints towards `z` (from `t` up to `t'`
below `z`, and from `s` down to `s'` above `z`) tightens the constraint.

/--
When `z` is a domain time, its zero-duration fiber is contained in *every* constraint on `z` —
fibers by `fib_zero_subset`, segments because a segment is the intersection of its two endpoint
fiber conditions (`seg_eq_inter_fib`).

### Nonemptiness of the members
-/

/--
Every fiber constraint is nonempty, by *Seriality*.

For a domain time `t ≤ z` this is the successor half of *Seriality* at the nonnegative duration
`z - t`; for `t ≥ z` it is the predecessor half at `t - z`, turned around by the converse
convention. No other axiom is used.
-/

    refine ⟨v, TaskFrame.mem_Fib.mpr ?_⟩
    have h' := (F.converse v (t - z) (τ.states t ht)).mp hv
    rwa [neg_sub] at h'

/--
Every segment constraint is nonempty, by the interpolation half of *Compositionality*.

The history's own task-respect gives `τ(t) ⇒_{s-t} τ(s)`, and `s - t = (z - t) + (s - z)` with
both summands positive because `t < z < s`. Interpolating at that split produces a state `u` with
`τ(t) ⇒_{z-t} u` and `u ⇒_{s-z} τ(s)`; the converse convention rewrites the second conjunct as
`τ(s) ⇒_{-(s-z)} u`, which is exactly membership in `[τ(t), τ(s)]_{z-t}^{s-z}`.

### Directedness
-/

/--
The constraint family is itself nonempty — the first conjunct of the `⊇`-directed condition
(`def:frame`'s opening clause).

The partial history's domain is nonempty by its `nonempty_domain` field. Any domain time `t`
contributes: if `t` is not paired about `z` it contributes its own fiber, and if it is paired the
witnessing pair straddles `z` and contributes a segment.
-/

  · exact ⟨_, mem_Constraints.mpr (Or.inr ⟨t, ht, hp, rfl⟩)⟩

/--
The directedness step of the `⊇`-directed condition: any two constraints on `z` are jointly refined by a third
constraint on `z`.

The proof is a four-way case analysis on `def:constraints`' two clauses, and the `¬ IsPaired`
side condition on fiber members is what makes two of the four cases collapse:

- **segment, segment**: the refining member is the segment cut at `max t₁ t₂` and `min s₁ s₂`,
  which still straddles `z`; `seg_subset_seg` gives both containments.
- **segment, fiber** (and its mirror): the segment's own endpoints witness that any domain time
  strictly below or strictly above `z` is paired, so the fiber's time can only be `z` itself —
  and then the fiber `Fib(τ(z), 0)` already refines the segment.
- **fiber, fiber**: if either time is `z` that fiber refines the other; otherwise both lie
  strictly on the same side of `z` (a strict straddle would pair them), and the refining member is
  the fiber at the time nearer `z` — `max` below, `min` above.

`lem:constraint`: the constraints imposed on a new duration form a directed family of nonempty
sets.

Recorded source (`lem:constraint`, verbatim): "For any partial history $\tau : X \to W$ over a
frame $\F = \tuple{W, \D, \Rightarrow}$ and duration $z \in D \setminus X$, the constraints
imposed on $z$ form a directed family of nonempty sets."

**This is the restructured statement.** The admissibility characterization that the lemma's
earlier merged form carried has been split out into `lem:admissible` (warranted by `lem:fibers`,
a RETIRED paper anchor resolving against the record's DANGLING entry)
and must not be folded back in here; directedness and member-nonemptiness are the whole content.

**Axioms consumed, for the §7-style threading check.** Exactly three, and the reader can verify
each by deleting the corresponding hypothesis and observing the failure:

- `hSer` (*Seriality*) — nonemptiness of the fiber members, via `nonempty_fib_of_serial`;
- `hInt` (the interpolation half of *Compositionality*) — nonemptiness of the segment members,
  via `nonempty_seg_of_interpolates`;
- `TaskFrame.forward_comp` (the composition half of *Compositionality*) — directedness, via the
  fiber-monotonicity lemmas `fib_subset_fib_of_le_of_le` and `fib_subset_fib_of_le_of_le'`.

*Compositionality* is therefore consumed in **both** of its directions here. *Saturation* is
**not** consumed: it is applied only at `lem:step`, the sole application site the paper names, and
this lemma is precisely what supplies that application its directed-family-of-nonempty-sets
hypothesis. *Limit* is not consumed either.

The paper's `z ∈ D \ X` proviso is not assumed: see this module's docstring for why the lemma
holds a fortiori when `z` is itself a domain time.
