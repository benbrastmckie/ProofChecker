# WorldHistory - World Histories for Task Semantics

This module defines world histories, which are functions from time domains to world states.

## Paper Specification Reference

**World Histories (`def:world-history`)**:
The JPL paper's layering, quoted verbatim: "A \textit{partial history} over a frame
$\F = \tuple{W, \D, \Rightarrow}$ is a function $\tau : X \to W$ on a nonempty set
$X \subseteq D$ where $\tau(x) \Rightarrow_{y-x} \tau(y)$ for all times $x, y \in X$. A
\textit{world history} is any partial history whose domain $X$ is \textit{convex}, so that
$y \in X$ whenever $x, z \in X$ and $x < y < z$. A world history is \textit{total}---
equivalently, a \textit{possible world}--- just in case $X = D$."

**ProofChecker Implementation**:
- `WorldHistory F` **extends** `PartialHistory F` (`FormalSystem/Semantics/PartialHistory.lean`),
  adding exactly one field: `convex`. This is the paper's layering, read as written — "a world
  history is any partial history whose domain `X` is convex".
- `domain: D → Prop` (inherited) represents the time subset `X ⊆ D`
- `nonempty_domain` (inherited) is the paper's requirement that `X` be *nonempty*
- `states: (t: D) → domain t → F.WorldState` (inherited) represents the function `τ: X → W`
- `respects_task` (inherited) is stated **unconditionally**, per the paper's own note that
  negative-difference instances are covered by the converse convention; the guarded form is
  available as `PartialHistory.respects_task_le`
- `convex` field enforces the paper's convexity requirement explicitly

**Two gaps this module used to record are now closed.** The nonemptiness field and the
`PartialHistory` layer both live in `PartialHistory.lean`, and `WorldHistory` inherits them. The
layering decision (why `extends` rather than a standalone structure or an `IsConvex` mixin, and
why nonemptiness is a field rather than a side hypothesis) is recorded in
`specs/decisions/total-history-validity-decisions.md`, Decision B.

**Convexity Requirement**: A domain is convex if whenever `x, z ∈ domain` with `x ≤ z`,
then all times `y` with `x ≤ y ≤ z` are also in the domain. This ensures histories
have no "gaps" in time.

**Critical Semantic Points**:
1. Box operator quantifies over ALL histories at time x
2. Past/Future operators quantify over times in the SAME history
3. Times must be in history's domain for evaluation
4. Domains must be convex (no temporal gaps)

## Main Definitions

- `WorldHistory F`: World history structure with convex domain and task constraint

## Main Results

- Example world histories (constant, trivial, universal) with convexity proofs
- Time-shift construction preserving convexity

## Implementation Notes

- Type parameter `D` represents temporal durations with ordered additive group structure
- Domain is represented as a predicate `D → Prop`
- Convexity is formally enforced. `def:world-history` states it strictly (`x < y < z`); the
  `convex` field uses `x ≤ y ≤ z`, which is **equivalent** — the endpoints are already in the
  domain by hypothesis — rather than identical to the paper's wording
- History must respect the task relation (compositionality)

World history for a task frame.

A world history assigns a world state to each time in its domain,
such that the history respects the task relation of the frame.

**Type Parameters**:
- `D`: Temporal duration type with totally ordered abelian group structure
- `F`: Task frame over temporal type `D`

**Paper Alignment**: matches the paper's `def:world-history` (see the module docstring for the
verbatim quote), which defines a world history as *any partial history whose domain is convex*.
This structure is exactly that: it `extends PartialHistory F` — inheriting `domain`,
`nonempty_domain`, `states`, and the unconditional `respects_task` — and adds the single
`convex` field.

Two gaps this docstring used to record are closed by the re-basing: the nonemptiness field now
exists (so the empty history is no longer a legal Lean `WorldHistory`), and the `PartialHistory`
layer exists as its own structure, since the paper's partial history requires nonemptiness
WITHOUT convexity and therefore cannot be carved out by weakening this one.

  Convexity constraint: domain has no temporal gaps.

  If times `x` and `z` are in the domain with `x ≤ z`, then every time `y`
  between them (`x ≤ y ≤ z`) must also be in the domain.

  **Paper Reference**: `def:world-history` (verbatim: "A \textit{world history} is any
  partial history whose domain $X$ is \textit{convex}, so that $y \in X$ whenever
  $x, z \in X$ and $x < y < z$."). The field reads `≤` on both sides where the paper has
  `<`; the two are equivalent, since the endpoints `x`, `z` are in the domain by hypothesis.

**The total world history determined by a bare state function.**

A *total* history's domain is all of `D`, so `nonempty_domain` and `convex` carry no information
and the dependent `states` field collapses to a plain `f : F.Duration → F.WorldState`. The only
genuine obligation left is `respects_task`. Every total-history construction in the library was
writing the same four-field skeleton out by hand and differing only in `f` and that one proof;
this is that skeleton, written once.

**Use `ofTotal` in preference to a literal `domain := fun _ => True` record.** Besides the line
saving, it is what makes `ofTotal_states` available, so `simp` closes the domain bridge that a
hand-written record forces each call site to open by hand.

**Sites this construction would also serve, not migrated here.** Twelve further constructions
outside `Semantics/` write the same skeleton and are follow-on work, deliberately out of this
change's scope: `Metalogic/CoNotPriorU.lean`, `Metalogic/DiscreteNonCompactness.lean`,
`Metalogic/Independence/ClockFrame.lean`,
`Metalogic/WeakCanonical/IntegerModel/ReynoldsBridge.lean` (two sites),
`Metalogic/Decidability/Verified/Bridge/RegionFrame.lean`, `Metalogic/Algebraic/FlowFrame.lean`,
`Semantics/Correspondence/DurationFrames.lean` (two sites),
`Semantics/Correspondence/FwdRecBridge.lean`, and `Examples/TemporalStructures.lean` (two sites).

**The domain bridge, as a simp lemma.**

`ofTotal`'s domain is all of `F.Duration`, so any domain obligation on it is `True`. Marking this
`@[simp]` is what lets a downstream `simp` discharge a domain side-goal that a hand-written
`domain := fun _ => True` record leaves it unable to see through — the constructor is opaque to
`simp` once it is behind a `def`, but this lemma is not. `Decidability/Propositional/Decidable.
lean`'s `trivial_truth_iff` is the worked demonstration: its `atom` case is closed by `simp`
alone, where before the migration it relied on unfolding the literal record.

**The load-bearing simp lemma of the construction.**

With `domain := fun _ => True` the domain proof carries no information, so reading `ofTotal`'s
state at *any* domain witness gives `f t` by `rfl`. Marking it `@[simp]` is what lets a call site
say `simp` where it would otherwise have to name the witness and rewrite under the dependent
`states` field by hand.

/--
Universal world history over all time (requires explicit reflexivity proof).

This history has every time in its domain and assigns the same world state everywhere.

**Frame Constraint Required**: Reflexivity proof parameter

A frame is reflexive if for all world states `w` and durations `d`, the task relation
`TaskRel w d w` holds. This is stronger than nullity (which only requires `TaskRel w 0 w`).

**Examples of Reflexive Frames**:
- `trivialFrame`: TaskRel is always True (reflexive)
- `natFrame`: TaskRel is `d ≠ 0 ∨ w = u` (reflexive via the right disjunct)
- `staticFrame`: TaskRel is `w = u` at every duration (reflexive)

**Non-Reflexive Frame Example**:
- A frame whose TaskRel holds only at duration 0 (e.g. `fun w x u => w = u ∧ x = 0`) is not
  reflexive for `d ≠ 0`. The library's former identity frame was such a frame; it violated the
  paper's *Seriality* axiom (`def:frame#Seriality`) and was replaced by the reflexive
  `staticFrame`.

**Justification**: For a constant history to respect the task relation, we need
`TaskRel w (t - s) w` for all times `s ≤ t`. Nullity only gives this when `s = t`.
Compositionality alone cannot build arbitrary-duration self-loops without additional
frame properties.

**Usage**: Call this function with a proof that `∀ d, F.TaskRel w d w`. For common frames,
use the frame-specific constructors `universalTrivialFrame` or `universalNatFrame` instead.

**Parameters**:
- `F`: The task frame
- `w`: The constant world state for all times
- `h_refl`: Proof that the frame is reflexive at state `w` for all durations
-/
def universal (F : TaskFrame) (w : F.WorldState)
    (h_refl : ∀ d : F.Duration, F.TaskRel w d w) : WorldHistory F :=
  ofTotal F (fun _ => w) fun s t => h_refl (t - s)

Trivial world history for the trivial frame.

Since trivial frame's task relation is always true, this always works.
The full domain is convex.

/--
Universal world history for trivial frame with a specific constant state.

This is a variant of `trivial` that allows specifying the constant state
(though in trivialFrame, WorldState = Unit, so this is equivalent to `trivial`).

Since trivialFrame's task relation is always true, any constant history respects the task relation.
The full domain is convex.

  ofTotal (FrameOver.trivialFrame (D := D)).toTaskFrame (fun _ => w) fun _ _ => True.intro

/--
Universal world history for nat frame with a specific constant Nat state.

Since natFrame's task relation is `d ≠ 0 ∨ w = u`, a constant history with state `n`
satisfies `respects_task` because `n = n` holds (right disjunct).

This demonstrates that frames with `nullity_identity` admit constant histories
as long as zero-duration relates identical states. The full domain is convex.

/-! ## Time-Shift Construction

The time-shift construction is fundamental to proving MF and TF axioms.
Given a history σ and times x, y, we construct a shifted history where
σ'(z) = σ(z + (y - x)).

This corresponds to "viewing σ from time x instead of time y".
-/

/--
Time-shifted history construction.

Given history `σ` and shift offset `Δ = y - x`, construct history `τ` where:
- `τ.domain z ↔ σ.domain (z + Δ)`
- `τ.states z = σ.states (z + Δ)`

This allows us to relate truth at (σ, y) to truth at (τ, x).

**Paper Reference**: `def:time-shift-histories` defines the relation `τ ≈ σ` between possible
worlds (`τ(z) = σ(z + y - x)` for all `z`), and `app:auto_existence` asserts that the shifted
possible world exists. This construction is the Lean witness for that existence, stated on
**arbitrary** histories (Lean-stronger and harmless: nothing about the shift needs totality);
`isTotal_timeShift` below is the paper's "total since 𝔇 is a group". The relation itself, read
on arbitrary histories, is `TimeShift.ShiftRel` in `Truth.lean`.

**Key Property**: If σ respects the task relation and has convex domain,
so does the shifted history, because:
1. Task relation only depends on duration (t - s), preserved under translation
2. Convexity is preserved under translation by group structure

/-! ## Totality and `H_F`

`def:world-history`, verbatim: "A world history is \textit{total}--- equivalently, a
\textit{possible world}--- just in case $X = D$. … The set of all possible worlds over
$\F$ is denoted $H_{\F}$."

Totality is inherited from `PartialHistory.IsTotal`; `WorldHistory.IsTotal` below is the
`WorldHistory`-level spelling of the same predicate, not a second notion. `TaskFrame.HF` bundles
it as a type, per Decision A of `specs/decisions/total-history-validity-decisions.md`: the
predicate form is used wherever totality is a *hypothesis*, and the subtype form only where `H_F`
is quantified over as an *object* in its own right.

/--
A world history is **total** — equivalently, a **possible world** — just in case its domain is
all of `D`.

**Paper Reference**: `def:world-history` (verbatim: "A world history is \textit{total}---
equivalently, a \textit{possible world}--- just in case $X = D$.").

This delegates to `PartialHistory.IsTotal`; it is a spelling, not a second predicate. It is
deliberately **not** Mathlib's `IsMax` or any order-theoretic maximality predicate — maximality
under the extension order is an internal step en route to the Extension Theorem, while totality
is what validity quantifies over.

theorem isTotal_iff (τ : WorldHistory F) : τ.IsTotal ↔ ∀ t : F.Duration, τ.domain t := Iff.rfl

/--
Totality is preserved by time shift.

The proof is `fun t => h (t + Δ)`: the shifted domain at `t` *is* the original domain at
`t + Δ`, definitionally, so a total original domain gives a total shifted domain with no
side condition whatsoever.

This is the lemma that carries the box case of time-shift preservation of truth. Under totality,
shift-preservation is strictly easier than it was under a designated shift-closed set of
admissible histories, because there is no closure condition left to carry.

`H_F` — the set of all total world histories over a frame, bundled as a type.

**Paper Reference**: `def:world-history` (verbatim: "The set of all possible worlds over
$\F$ is denoted $H_{\F}$.").

**Encoding note** (Decision A of `specs/decisions/total-history-validity-decisions.md`): this
subtype is used **only** where `H_F` appears as an object in its own right — the Extension
Theorem's conclusion, the Occurrence Corollary, and the optional frame-relative validity. Where
totality is a *hypothesis* (truth, validity, semantic consequence, satisfiability), the predicate
form `(τ : WorldHistory F) (hτ : τ.IsTotal)` is used instead.

This is **not** a parallel validity notion or an alias: there is exactly one validity predicate,
and `HF` is a bundled name for the same `IsTotal` predicate, bridged only by `.val` / `.property`.

`H_F` at the **fibre**, so that `F.HF` resolves for a fibre-typed frame as well as for a
total-space one.

Generalized field notation resolves by the head constant of `F`'s type and never consults a
coercion, so both spellings have to exist wherever both are used. Note the direction of the
delegation: `WorldHistory` is declared over the total space, so `TaskFrame.HF` is the primitive
and this is the delegating spelling — the reverse of what the plan anticipated, and forced by the
existing layering rather than chosen.
