# Validity - Semantic Validity and Consequence

This module defines semantic validity and consequence for TM formulas.

## Main Definitions

- `Valid`: A formula is valid if true at every **total** history, in every model
- `SemanticConsequence`: Semantic consequence relation, quantified over total histories
- `satisfiable`: A context is satisfiable if consistent (exists some temporal type)
- Notation: `⊨ φ` for validity, `Γ ⊨ φ` for semantic consequence

## Main Results

- Basic validity lemmas
- Relationship between validity and semantic consequence

## Implementation Notes

- Validity quantifies over every temporal type `D` with `LinearOrderedAddCommGroup D`, and over
  the **total** histories: `τ.IsTotal`, i.e. `∀ t, τ.domain t`. There is no admissible-history
  parameter and no shift-closure side condition; `TruthAt` takes no set argument.
- The statement needs no shift-closure hypothesis because `timeShift` preserves totality
  (`WorldHistory.isTotal_timeShift`), so time-shift invariance carries no side condition.
- Satisfiability existentially quantifies over a total witness history.
- Caller trap: `Valid` and `SemanticConsequence` are `ValidIn` / `SemanticConsequenceIn` at
  `FrameClass.Base`. Their pre-abbreviation binder shape is reachable through the `.of_forall`
  and `.apply` adapters below, never by `unfold`.

## Paper Alignment

`def:logical-consequence` is quoted verbatim at `SemanticConsequence` below, which is the
definition of record for this module. `H_F` is the set of total histories of the frame, so
`τ ∈ H_F` is `τ.IsTotal`; the polymorphic quantification over `LinearOrderedAddCommGroup D`
renders "for all models M" and "times x in D".

/-! ### The finite-context consequence layer, indexed by frame predicate and by `FrameClass`

The two-layer shape `ValidOnFrames` / `ValidIn` gives validity, applied to consequence from a
finite context: a predicate-indexed primitive, and a `FrameClass`-tagged abbreviation over it.
`Metalogic/SetConsequence.lean` carries the `Γ : Set Formula` twin of this pair
(`SetConsequenceOnFrames` / `SetSemanticConsequenceOn`). The two layers are deliberately distinct
types — the set form is the vocabulary of the strong-completeness statements, this one is the
finite-context relation the consequence theorems in `Metalogic/StrongCompleteness.lean` actually
discharge. -/

/-- Semantic consequence from a finite context, over every frame satisfying `P`: the
predicate-indexed primitive, mirroring `ValidOnFrames`. Indexing by a bare frame predicate rather
than by a `FrameClass` tag is what lets one definition serve every class. -/

/-- `cor:tm-completeness`'s class-restricted consequence `Γ ⊨_C φ` at a finite context: the
mirror of `ValidIn`, over the same `FrameClass.Sat`. The four named consequence relations —
`SemanticConsequence` here, and `SemanticConsequenceDense` / `SemanticConsequenceZTime` /
`SemanticConsequenceRTime` in `Metalogic/StrongCompleteness.lean` — are its four
instances. -/

/--
Semantic consequence: `Γ ⊨ φ` means φ is true in all models where all of `Γ` are true,
for every temporal type `D` satisfying `LinearOrderedAddCommGroup`.

Formally: for every temporal type `D`, at every model, **total** history and time where all
formulas in `Γ` are true, formula `φ` is also true.

**Definition of record — `def:logical-consequence`**, verbatim:

> A conclusion phi is a *logical consequence* of a set of premises Gamma --- written
> Gamma |= phi --- just in case for all models M, possible worlds tau in H_F, and times x in D,
> if M,tau,x |= gamma for all premises gamma in Gamma, then M,tau,x |= phi. A sentence phi is
> *valid* just in case |= phi.

This is that clause on the nose: "possible worlds tau in H_F" is `τ.IsTotal`, and the
quantification is over all `x ∈ D` (all times in the temporal order), not just times in
`dom(τ)`. No admissible-history parameter, no shift-closure side condition.

**`SemanticConsequence` is `SemanticConsequenceIn` at the unconstrained class**, exactly as
`Valid` is `ValidIn .Base`: `Sat FrameClass.Base` is `True`, so the tag attaches no frame
condition and "all carriers" *is* the class. The pre-abbreviation binder shape is reachable
through `SemanticConsequence.of_forall` / `.apply` below.

Note: Uses `Type` (not `Type*`) to avoid universe level issues in proofs.

/-! ### Binder-shape adapters

The explicit binder shapes. `ConsequenceOnFrames` already quantifies over the
unbundled `(τ : WorldHistory F) (_ : τ.IsTotal)` pair, so — unlike `ValidOnFrames`, which bundles
the history into `TaskFrame.HF` — no history-shape adapter is needed at the generic layer. What
each `of_forall` restores is the *frame condition*, putting it back into the local context in the
form typeclass resolution can see: `Sat .Dense F` is `TaskFrame.IsDense F`, whose head symbol is
not `DenselyOrdered`, so a bare hypothesis of that type is invisible to instance search. The three
class-restricted pairs live beside their definitions in `Metalogic/StrongCompleteness.lean`. -/

/-- Introduce `SemanticConsequence` from its pre-abbreviation binder shape; the `Sat .Base`
argument (`True`) is discharged here rather than at each call site. -/

/-- Introduce `SemanticConsequenceIn` at an arbitrary tag from the frame-condition-explicit
binder shape. The body is `h` — `ConsequenceOnFrames` already quantifies over the unbundled
`(τ : WorldHistory F) (_ : τ.IsTotal)` pair, so nothing has to be reshaped.

**This is why the per-class consequence adapters were boilerplate.** The three pairs that used
to live in `Metalogic/StrongCompleteness.lean` (`SemanticConsequenceDense`,
`SemanticConsequenceZTime`, `SemanticConsequenceRTime`) were each this lemma at a fixed
tag with `fc.Sat F` unfolded to that class's frame condition; they are deleted, and a site now
writes the tag instead of picking a name. -/

/--
A context is satisfiable in temporal type `D` if there exists a model where all formulas
in the context are true.

The witness history is required to be **total** (`τ.IsTotal`), which is the exact dual of the
totality constraint in `Valid`: `satisfiable D Γ` and validity-style quantification range over
the same class of histories, so `¬satisfiable` and consequence line up (see
`unsatisfiable_implies_all`).

**No paper anchor.** Unlike `Valid` and `SemanticConsequence`, which render
`def:logical-consequence` verbatim, satisfiability has no counterpart in the definitions of
record. Its totality constraint and its `[Nontrivial D]` binder are a **design decision**
inherited from `Valid` so that the two notions are duals over one and the same history class —
not a reconciliation finding, and not attributable to any definition anchor.

This is the semantic notion of consistency relative to a temporal type.
For absolute satisfiability (exists in some type), use `∃ D, satisfiable D Γ`.

**Note**: Satisfiability quantifies over all times `t : D`, not just domain times.
-/
def satisfiable (D : TemporalOrder) (Γ : Context) : Prop :=
  ∃ (F : FrameOver D) (M : TaskModel F.toTaskFrame)
    (τ : WorldHistory F.toTaskFrame) (_ : τ.IsTotal) (t : ↑D),
    ∀ φ ∈ Γ, TruthAt M τ t φ

/--
A context is absolutely satisfiable if it is satisfiable in some temporal type.

Carries `Nontrivial` alongside the other structure binders so that `satisfiable` applies; see
the "No paper anchor" note on `satisfiable`.
-/
def SatisfiableAbs (Γ : Context) : Prop :=
  ∃ D : TemporalOrder, satisfiable D Γ

/--
A single formula is satisfiable if there exists a model where it is true at some point.

This is the single-formula version of `satisfiable` (which works on contexts).
A formula is satisfiable if there exists some temporal type D, some task frame,
some model, some world history, and some time where the formula evaluates to true.

**Usage**: Used in the Finite Model Property to connect formula satisfiability
to the existence of finite models.

**Relationship to Context Satisfiability**:
`FormulaSatisfiable φ ↔ satisfiable Int [φ]` (for Int time, but holds for any D)

**No paper anchor** — see the note on `satisfiable`. The totality constraint on the witness
history and the `Nontrivial` binder are inherited from `Valid` as a design decision.

/-! ## Frame-relative validity `⊨_F` (`def:frame-validity`)

Charter §8's optional deliverable. Everything above quantifies over *all* frames; this section
adds the notion that holds a single frame fixed.

**Definition of record — `def:frame-validity`**, verbatim:

> A well-formed sentence phi of BL is *valid over a task frame* F = ⟨W, D, ⇒⟩ which we may write
> |=_F phi if and only if M,tau,x |= phi for every model M = ⟨W, D, ⇒, |·|⟩ where
> F = ⟨W, D, ⇒⟩, possible world tau in H_F, and time x in D.

**No notation is introduced for `⊨_F`.** `Truth.lean` records that a `TruthAt` notation was
dropped because it conflicts with the `⊨` validity notation in this file; a subscripted variant
would sit in the same parser neighbourhood for no gain. The ASCII name `TaskFrame.ValidOn` is
used instead, and dot-notation (`F.ValidOn φ`) reads as the paper's `⊨_F φ` does.

**This is not a parallel validity notion.** `valid_iff_forall_validOn` below proves the two are
related by quantification over frames, so `ValidOn` is a specialization of the one validity
predicate rather than a competitor to it — the same discipline `TaskFrame.HF` follows with
respect to `WorldHistory.IsTotal`.
-/

/--
`def:frame-validity`: `φ` is **valid over the frame `F`** iff it is true at every model over `F`,
every possible world `τ ∈ H_F`, and every time `x ∈ D`.

Recorded source (`def:frame-validity`, verbatim): "A well-formed sentence $\varphi$ of $\BL$ is
\emph{valid over a task frame} $\F = \tuple{W, \D, \Rightarrow}$ which we may write
$\vDash_{\F} \varphi$ if and only if $\M,\tau,x \vDash \varphi$ for every model
$\M = \tuple{W, \D, \Rightarrow, \vert{\cdot}}$ where $\F = \tuple{W, \D, \Rightarrow}$, possible
world $\tau \in H_{\F}$, and time $x \in D$."

Each of the three quantifiers is rendered on the nose:

* "every model `M = ⟨W, D, ⇒, |·|⟩` where `F = ⟨W, D, ⇒⟩`" is `∀ M : TaskModel F` — the frame is
  a *parameter* of `TaskModel`, so the side condition that `M`'s frame reduct is `F` is carried
  by the type rather than by a hypothesis.
* "possible world `τ ∈ H_F`" is `∀ τ : F.HF`, the bundled subtype. Per `WorldHistory.lean`'s
  encoding note, the bundled form is used exactly where `H_F` appears as an object in its own
  right, which is how the recorded text reads here.
* "time `x ∈ D`" is `∀ x : D` — all of the temporal order, not merely `dom(τ)`; for a total `τ`
  the two coincide.

Unlike `Valid`, this carries no `[Nontrivial D]` binder: `Valid` needs it to state its
quantification over temporal types, whereas here `D` and `F` are both already given.

namespace TaskFrame

/--
**The bridge between the two validity shapes.**

`TaskFrame.ValidOn` quantifies over the bundled subtype `F.HF`; correspondence arguments are
naturally written with the history and its totality proof unbundled. One term in each direction,
because `TaskFrame.HF` is a subtype and `.val`/`.property` are its projections.

Stated here, beside `TaskFrame.ValidOn` itself, rather than in the one correspondence module that
first needed it: the unbundling is a fact about the definition, not about any particular
correspondence argument, and its callers now sit in more than one module.

  ⟨fun h M τ hτ t => h M ⟨τ, hτ⟩ t, fun h M τ t => h M τ.val τ.property t⟩

/--
Frame-relative validity is **never vacuous**: no frame validates `⊥`.

Without this, `F.ValidOn` would be satisfied trivially by any frame whose `H_F` happened to be
empty, and `F.ValidOn ⊥` would be a theorem rather than a refutation. What rules that out is
exactly `cor:occurrence`'s closing clause — `H_F ≠ ∅` — so the frame axioms it consumes appear
here as hypotheses.

**Wholly frame-intrinsic.** *Saturation*, *Seriality*, *Interpolation* and *Limit* are not
arguments: `FrameOver` carries them as structure fields, and `cor:occurrence` reads them off the
frame. Neither is a world state: the carrier's nonemptiness is the `nonempty` field, so the
statement is the bare `¬ F.ValidOn ⊥` with `F` its only argument, exactly as `def:frame`'s
"nonempty set of world states" licenses.

The model witness is `TaskModel.allFalse`; any model would do, since `⊥`'s truth clause is
`False` independently of the valuation.
-/

  intro hvalid
  obtain ⟨τ, _⟩ := PartialHistory.occurrence F F.worldNonempty.some 0

/--
`cor:occurrence`'s closing clause restated in the shape this section consumes it: `H_F` has an
inhabitant, so the `∀ τ : F.HF` in `ValidOn` is a non-vacuous quantifier. Everything it rests
on — the four axioms and the carrier's nonemptiness — is a field of the frame.

This is a thin restatement of `PartialHistory.hF_nonempty`, kept here so the reason
`not_validOn_bot` holds is legible next to the statement itself.

end TaskFrame

/-! ## `FrameClass`-indexed validity

The proof side is parameterized by `ProofSystem.FrameClass` throughout — `Derivable fc`,
`DerivationTree fc`, and `DerivationTree.lift` along `fc₁ ≤ fc₂`. This section gives the semantic
side the same index, so that `ValidIn fc` stands to `Derivable fc` as `⊨` stands to `⊢`.

**Definition of record — `cor:tm-completeness`**: "Where `Γ ⊨_C φ` restricts
`def:logical-consequence` to models over task frames in a class `C` ...". `ValidIn fc` is that
`⊨_C`, with the class `C` read off the tag by `FrameClass.Sat`
(`Semantics/FrameClassValidity.lean`) rather than inlined as a binder list.
`TaskFrame.ValidOn` (`def:frame-validity`, above) stays the single frame-level primitive
underneath; nothing here duplicates it.

### Why the primitive takes a bare predicate rather than a tag

`ValidOnFrames` is stated over an arbitrary `P : TaskFrame → Prop`, and `ValidIn fc` is its
instance at `fc.Sat`. The generality is load-bearing: it is what lets **one** monotonicity lemma
cover every validity bridge in the tree, including `ValidComplete`, which is
`ValidOnFrames TaskFrame.IsComplete` and cannot be `ValidIn`-anything because no `FrameClass`
constructor denotes `def:frame-properties`' bare Complete clause (see the `FrameClass` docstring
in `ProofSystem/Axioms.lean`).
-/

/--
`φ` is valid on every frame satisfying `P`.

The frame-predicate-indexed primitive that every class-restricted validity notion in this module
is an instance of. `ValidIn` below is the instance at a `FrameClass` tag; `ValidComplete` is the
instance at `TaskFrame.IsComplete`, which no tag denotes.
-/
def ValidOnFrames (P : TaskFrame → Prop) (φ : Formula) : Prop :=
  ∀ F : TaskFrame, P F → F.ValidOn φ

/--
`cor:tm-completeness`'s class-restricted consequence `⊨_C`, at the empty premise set: `φ` is valid
on every frame in the class the tag `fc` denotes.

This is the semantic mirror of `Derivable fc`, and the definition this module's four
class-restricted predicates are abbreviations over. Its frame constraint is not written here at
all — it is `FrameClass.Sat fc`, which is where the interpretation of each tag is recorded once.
-/
def ValidIn (fc : ProofSystem.FrameClass) (φ : Formula) : Prop :=
  ValidOnFrames fc.Sat φ

/--
A formula is valid if it is true in all models, at all times, at every **total** history, for
every temporal type `D` satisfying `LinearOrderedAddCommGroup`.

Formally: for every temporal type `D`, every task frame `F` over `D`, every model `M` over
`F`, every history `τ` with `τ.IsTotal`, and every time `t : D`, the formula is true at
`(M, τ, t)`.

**Definition of record — `def:logical-consequence`**, verbatim:

> A conclusion phi is a *logical consequence* of a set of premises Gamma --- written
> Gamma |= phi --- just in case for all models M, possible worlds tau in H_F, and times x in D,
> if M,tau,x |= gamma for all premises gamma in Gamma, then M,tau,x |= phi. A sentence phi is
> *valid* just in case |= phi.

The "possible worlds tau in H_F" of that clause are the frame's **total** histories, which is
what `τ.IsTotal` says. There is no admissible-history parameter and no shift-closure side
condition: a shift-closure hypothesis is unnecessary in the statement of validity because
totality is trivially preserved by `timeShift` (`WorldHistory.isTotal_timeShift`), so time-shift
invariance carries no side condition to quantify over. `TruthAt` takes no set argument.

Validity also quantifies over all `x ∈ D` (all times in the temporal order), not just times in
`dom(τ)` — for a total history those coincide.

Note: Uses `Type` (not `Type*`) to avoid universe level issues in proofs.

**`Valid` is `ValidIn` at the unconstrained class.** `Sat FrameClass.Base` is `True`, so
`ValidIn .Base` quantifies over every task frame with no frame condition attached — exactly
`def:logical-consequence`'s closing clause. `Valid` stands to `Derivable .Base` as `ValidIn fc`
stands to `Derivable fc`, with the class tag in the same place on both sides.

Caller trap: the explicit binder shape `∀ (F) (M) (τ : WorldHistory F), τ.IsTotal → ∀ t` is
reachable through `Valid.of_forall_total` and `Valid.apply`, which discharge the `True` argument
so no call site writes `trivial`.

/--
Validity **is** validity on every frame: `⊨ φ` iff `φ` is valid over every frame of every
temporal type.

This is the theorem that keeps `TaskFrame.ValidOn` from being a second, competing validity
notion. `Valid` (`def:logical-consequence`'s closing clause) and `TaskFrame.ValidOn`
(`def:frame-validity`) differ only in *which* quantifiers are discharged: `Valid` closes over the
temporal type and the frame, `ValidOn` leaves both fixed. Stated as a theorem rather than
introduced as an abbreviation, exactly so that the equivalence is a proof obligation the build
checks and not a definitional identity asserted by fiat.

Both directions are the `.val`/`.property` bridge between `F.HF` and the predicate form
`(τ : WorldHistory F) (hτ : τ.IsTotal)` that `Valid` uses — the two spellings of one and the same
`IsTotal` predicate, per `WorldHistory.lean`'s encoding note. No mathematical content is added in
either direction; that is the point of the statement.

/--
**The one monotonicity lemma.** `ValidOnFrames` is antitone in its frame predicate: shrinking the
class of frames quantified over can only preserve validity.

Every validity bridge in the tree is a corollary of this one statement — the four `Valid`-to-
class-restricted bridges, the `ValidComplete`-to-`ValidRTime` bridge, and `ValidIn.mono`
below. Before this lemma each was written out by hand against its own inlined binder list.

/--
Validity is monotone in the `FrameClass` order: `fc₁ ≤ fc₂ → ValidIn fc₁ φ → ValidIn fc₂ φ`.

**This points the same direction as `DerivationTree.lift`** (`ProofSystem/Derivation.lean`), which
carries a derivation at `fc₁` up to any `fc₂ ≥ fc₁`. That the proof side and the semantic side
climb the order together is the symmetry this indexing exists to restore, and it holds because
`FrameClass.Sat` is *antitone*: a larger tag denotes a more constrained collection of frames.
The order-direction argument itself lives in `FrameClass.Sat.anti` and is not restated here.

/-! ### The migration lever

`ValidOnFrames` is defined through `TaskFrame.ValidOn`, whose history quantifier is the bundled
`(τ : TaskFrame.HF F)`; every predicate this module states by hand instead uses the unbundled pair
`(τ : WorldHistory F) (_ : τ.IsTotal)`. `valid_iff_forall_validOn` already proves the two spellings
agree, but they are not *definitionally* equal, so a proof written against one shape does not
elaborate against the other. The lemmas below are the shape adapters: a goal site becomes
`refine ValidOnFrames.of_forall_total ?_; intro F hF M τ hτ t`, and a hypothesis site becomes
`h.apply_total F hF M τ hτ t`.

**Two triples, and no more than two.** Every adapter in this file is indexed either by a bare
frame predicate `P : TaskFrame → Prop` (`ValidOnFrames.{of_forall_total, apply_total, of_not}`)
or by a `FrameClass` tag (`ValidIn.{of_forall_total, apply_total, of_not}`), and the second is
literally the first at `fc.Sat`. **Do not add a per-class third.** `FrameClass.Sat` is
`@[reducible]` and `TaskFrame.IsDense` an `abbrev`, so a `Sat .Dense F` hypothesis registers
itself with instance search on `intro` and a tag-specific copy buys nothing. If a tag needs its
frame condition taken apart, that is what the `sat_intro` tactic
(`Semantics/FrameClassValidity.lean`) is for; a new `ValidX.of_forall` is the thing this layer
exists to make unnecessary.

`Valid.{of_forall_total, apply, of_not}` and `SemanticConsequence.{of_forall, apply}` survive for
a different reason, and are not exceptions to the rule above: they discharge `Sat .Base = True`

A formula is valid over dense temporal orders if it is true in all models where D is
densely ordered, at all total histories, and all times.

This restricts `Valid` to temporal types with `DenselyOrdered D`, capturing the
frame condition for the density axiom DN: `F(phi) -> F(F(phi))`.

**An abbreviation over `ValidIn`.** The frame constraint is `FrameClass.Sat .Dense`, which is
`TaskFrame.IsDense`, `def:frame-properties`' Dense clause. The explicit binder shape is
recovered by the generic `ValidIn.of_forall_total` / `ValidIn.apply_total`, and the density
witness reaches typeclass resolution directly: `Sat` is `@[reducible]` and `TaskFrame.IsDense`
is an `abbrev`, so a `Sat .Dense F` hypothesis registers as a `DenselyOrdered` instance the
moment it is introduced. No class-specific adapter is needed.

A formula is valid over discrete temporal orders if it is true in all models where D
has successor and predecessor structure, at all total histories, and all times.

This restricts `Valid` to temporal types with `SuccOrder D` and `PredOrder D`,
capturing the frame condition for the discreteness axioms DF/DP.

**Now an abbreviation over `ValidIn`.** The frame constraint is `FrameClass.Sat .ZTime`, which
is `TaskFrame.IsZTime` — `def:BX-z`'s narrowing to ℤ-time (`prop:archimedean`), *not*
`def:frame-properties`' bare Discrete clause. Recording the narrowing in the tag's interpretation
rather than in a binder list here is what keeps `soundness_ztime` from silently widening its
frame class. The binder shape this definition used to have is recovered by the generic
`ValidIn.of_forall_total` / `ValidIn.apply_total` followed by `sat_intro`, which destructures the
`IsZTime` existential into the four instances.

**Notation**: `⊨_discrete φ`

## The two directions cost differently, and only one needs a carrier lemma

The binder bundle below is instantiated by `ℤ` with **no instance work whatsoever** — no
`Archimedean`, no least-positive-element witness, nothing beyond what Mathlib already provides for
`ℤ`. Two consequences, which are easy to conflate and should not be:

- **Refuting** `ValidZTime φ` is free of any carrier lemma. A countermodel presented over `ℤ`
  — e.g. one built by `IntPresentation.toTaskFrame`, whose duration type *is* `ℤ` — discharges
  the `∀ D` binder by instantiating it at `ℤ` and applying the resulting truth to the
  countermodel's own history and time. Measured: that argument is five lines and elaborates at
  `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.
- **Establishing** `ValidZTime φ` from a statement about `ℤ`-frames alone is the direction that
  needs work, because there the `∀ D` binder must be *discharged for an arbitrary* `D`, which
  requires normalizing `D` to `ℤ` and transporting the frame, `TaskModel`, `WorldHistory`, and
  `TruthAt` across the resulting isomorphism.

`Semantics/IntNormalForm.lean`'s module docstring names the exact Mathlib route for that
normalization, and records why the order-only isomorphism is the wrong turn. The successor-based
analogue of `DurationClassification.lean`'s `archimedean_of_lub` — the input that route needs — is
now present: `DurationClassification.lean`'s `archimedean_of_succ` supplies the `Archimedean D`
instance from `[IsSuccArchimedean D]`, `isLeast_pos_succ_zero` supplies the least-positive-element
witness, and `intIso : D ≃+o ℤ` packages both into the additive transfer. The transport itself is
`Semantics/IntTransfer.lean`, whose `validZTime_iff_validInt : ValidZTime φ ↔ ValidInt φ`
closes this direction outright: establishing `ValidZTime φ` from a statement about ℤ-frames
alone is now a single rewrite.

**THE `ValidComplete` CAVEAT — canonical statement; every other site in the tree points here.**
If you are about to write a second copy of this argument, write a pointer instead.

A formula is `ValidComplete` if it is true in every model whose temporal type `D` has the
least-upper-bound property, at every total history and every time.

`ValidComplete` is the **only** `Valid*` name in this development that is not `ValidIn` at the
tag its name suggests. `Valid`, `ValidDense`, `ValidZTime` and `ValidRTime` are `ValidIn` at
`.Base`, `.Dense`, `.ZTime`, `.RTime` definitionally; this one is
`ValidOnFrames TaskFrame.IsComplete` — `def:frame-properties`' **bare** Complete clause, which
`ℤ` satisfies — because no `FrameClass` constructor denotes the bare Complete class (see the
`FrameClass` docstring in `ProofSystem/Axioms.lean`).

**Caller trap: do not retarget `soundness_rtime` at it.** `FrameClass.RTime` sits strictly above
`FrameClass.Dense`, so `Axiom.density` (`GGφ → Gφ`) and `Axiom.dense_indicator` (`¬(⊥ U ⊤)`) are
admissible in a `.RTime` derivation. Both are false on `ℤ`: for `density`, take `φ` true exactly
at times `≥ t + 2`, so `GGφ` holds at `t` while `Gφ` fails; for `dense_indicator`, `⊥ U ⊤` is
true on `ℤ` because every point has an immediate successor. Mathlib gives `ℤ` a
`ConditionallyCompleteLinearOrder`, so `ℤ` satisfies every binder of this predicate, and a
`soundness_rtime : DerivationTree .RTime … → ValidComplete` would be **refutable**.
`soundness_rtime` targets `ValidRTime`; this predicate is landed as the strictly weaker
statement and as the target of the forgetful bridge from `Valid`. The trap is structural, not
merely documented: the two are built from different frame predicates
(`ValidOnFrames TaskFrame.IsComplete` against `ValidIn .RTime`, i.e. `TaskFrame.IsRTime`), so
writing the refutable version means naming a different predicate, not dropping a binder.

**`DenselyOrdered` is deliberately absent.** Including it would silently narrow the predicate to
real flow alone; the density-carrying variant is `ValidRTime` below, and `TaskFrame.IsRTime`
(`Semantics/FrameProperty.lean`) states why the narrowed class is named for its carrier.

Dedekind completeness is expressed by the explicit `Prop`-valued hypothesis

  `∀ s : Set D, s.Nonempty → BddAbove s → ∃ x, IsLUB s x`

rather than by swapping the tree's `[LinearOrder D]` binder for
`[ConditionallyCompleteLinearOrder D]`: every downstream `[LinearOrder D]`-indexed lemma then
continues to apply with no instance-unification risk. The generic
`ValidOnFrames.{of_forall_total, apply_total, of_not}` triple adapts between this shape and the
explicit-hypothesis shape — this predicate is why that triple exists at the bare-predicate layer
and not only at a `FrameClass` tag.

**The model class.** That `ℤ` satisfies every binder is the discrete branch of the Hölder
dichotomy: by `complete_duration_discrete_or_dense`
(`Semantics/DurationClassification.lean`) a duration group with the least-upper-bound hypothesis
is either `≃+o ℤ` or densely ordered, and by `complete_not_dense_iso_int` the non-dense case is
`≃+o ℤ` on the nose. So this predicate's model class is `{ℤ, ℝ}` up to isomorphism and its
theory is `Th(ℤ) ∩ Th(ℝ)`. **It is the class of no paper system.** `cor:tm-completeness` names
four rows, and the one this predicate could be mistaken for — the `ℝ`-time row, `TM_r` in the
paper's notation and `TM⁺_r` in this tree's — is weak completeness over the dense-and-complete
class, which is `FrameClass.RTime` / `ValidRTime`, not this predicate. `ValidComplete` is
repository-only; see `Metalogic/Conservativity.lean` for how the two families of system name
line up.

**Source.** Reynolds 1992 (printed p.169) observes that the Prior axioms enforce only a
*definably* Dedekind-complete model: "there may be gaps in the order but ... you wouldn't know
that just looking at the behaviour of temporal formulas". So no single axiom characterises this
class; `Axiom.prior_U_gap` / `Axiom.prior_S_gap` / `Axiom.sep` are the definable-gap proxy.

def ValidComplete (φ : Formula) : Prop := ValidOnFrames TaskFrame.IsComplete φ

/--
A formula is valid over **dense Dedekind-complete** temporal orders. This is the real-flow
predicate, and sharply so: up to order-and-group isomorphism `ℝ` is the *only* nontrivial model,
not merely a paradigm one.

**This is `ValidIn .RTime`** — `FrameClass.Sat .RTime` is `TaskFrame.IsRTime`, the
conjunction of `def:frame-properties`' Dense and Complete clauses — and it is therefore the
predicate the `.RTime` tag denotes, whatever its name may suggest about `ValidComplete`. The
binder shape this definition used to have is recovered by the generic
`ValidIn.of_forall_total` / `ValidIn.apply_total` followed by `sat_intro`, which splits
`IsRTime` into the density instance and the least-upper-bound hypothesis.

**Why the density binder is exactly the right cut.** By
`FormalSystem.Semantics.complete_duration_discrete_or_dense`
(`Semantics/DurationClassification.lean`), a duration group satisfying the least-upper-bound
hypothesis is *either* `≃+o ℤ` *or* densely ordered, and by
`FormalSystem.Semantics.complete_not_dense_iso_int` those branches are exclusive. So adding
`DenselyOrdered` deletes precisely the `ℤ` branch of the Hölder dichotomy and nothing else —
which is why `ℤ` is excluded here even though it satisfies every binder of `ValidComplete`.
(Getting from "dense and complete" to a literal `≃+o ℝ` needs one further step this repository
does not carry; the composition path and the reason it is out of scope are recorded in the
`DurationClassification` module docstring.)

**This is the target of `soundness_rtime`**, not `ValidComplete`, and retargeting it at the
weaker predicate yields a refutable theorem. See the `ValidComplete` caveat in `Semantics/Validity.lean` — the one place the `ValidComplete` / `ValidRTime` distinction is argued in full.

The placement of `RTime` above `Dense` is itself primary-source: Reynolds 1992 (printed
p.168) includes in US/R "axioms for density and no end points: `K⁺⊤`, `K⁻⊤`, `F⊤`, `P⊤`", and
`K⁺⊤` is `¬(¬⊤ U ⊤)` in this tree's guard-first infix, which normalises (`¬⊤ ↝ ⊥`) to
`¬(⊥ U ⊤)`, this tree's `Axiom.dense_indicator`.

whole reason the primitive is indexed by a frame predicate rather than by a tag. -/
