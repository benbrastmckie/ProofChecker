# Non-validities of `⊡` on the permissive frame over ℤ

Machine-checked refutations of the candidate `⊡`/tense interaction principles that are **not**
axioms of TM⋆ (`PlusLanguage/Axioms.lean`). Every refutation lives on one countermodel: the
permissive frame `natFrame` over `ℤ` (`Semantics/TaskFrame.lean`), where every function
`ℤ → ℕ` is a total history, so `⟨τ⟩_t` is as large as it can be; the valuation makes every atom
true at world state `0` and nowhere else.

| Name | Refuted schema | What it shows |
|------|----------------|---------------|
| `refute_stab_box` | `⊡p → □⊡p` | `⊡` does not collapse into `□` |
| `refute_allFuture_stab` | `G⊡p → ⊡Gp` | the converse of GS fails, even for atoms |
| `refute_stab_allFuture_past` | `⊡GPp → G⊡Pp` | GS (`stab_allFuture_valid`) genuinely needs its pure-future side condition |
| `refute_determined` | `Fp → ⊡Fp` | *Determined* (paper line 1426) is refuted over a non-deterministic frame |
| `refute_somePast_stab` | `P⊡p → ⊡Pp` | `⟨τ⟩_t` is not closed towards the past |

On `refute_determined`: this module lands only the refutation over a non-deterministic frame
(the second half of the paper's `app:deterministic` correspondence theorem, in the `natFrame` shape); validity of the *Determined*
schema over deterministic frames is **not** formalized here, and no claim about the class of
frames validating it is made.

On `refute_allFuture_stab` / `refute_stab_allFuture_past`: GS (`Semantics/PlusPasting.lean`,
`stab_allFuture_valid`) is `⊡Gφ → G⊡φ` for **pure-future** `φ`. The second refutation shows the
restriction is necessary — with `φ := Pp` the pasted history keeps `τ`'s past, not the
witness's, and `Pp` flips — and the first shows the converse direction is simply wrong.

`refute_somePast_stab` is the `⊡`-analogue of the single tense/modal interaction axiom of
T×W / Ockhamist logic (Kamp's AK12 in Thomason 1984 §4; Reynolds 2003's HN), and it fails here
because `⟨τ⟩_t` is defined by a same-time condition, with no backward closure.

## Provenance

Transcription of Part D of the compiled stability-modal probes recorded with the research on the
`⊡` axiomatization; proofs unchanged.

*Determined* `Fp → ⊡Fp` is refuted over a non-deterministic frame: the **negative half** of
`app:deterministic`, in the `natFrame` shape.

The positive half **is** formalized, in `FormalSystem/Semantics/PlusDeterminism.lean` — see
`determined_of_deterministic`, which shows the schema valid on every frame satisfying
`TaskFrame.Deterministic` (`Semantics/FrameProperty.lean`). The two halves are the two sides of
`app:deterministic` and cite each other; neither statement claims the other's converse, and in
fact the converse of the positive half is false (a non-deterministic frame validating the schema
is exhibited under `Metalogic/Independence/`).

Two things the refutation depends on, recorded because both are easy to lose:

* **The refuting instance is `Fp`, not an atom.** At an atom the schema `p → ⊡p` holds on *every*
  frame (`stab_atom_of_atom`, `Semantics/PlusTruth.lean`): an atom's truth depends on the world
  state alone, which is exactly what `⊡` quantifies over. So no uniform-substitution argument is
  available here — a schema can be frame-valid at its atomic instances and refutable at a
  genuinely temporal one, and it is. Every refutation in this family must exhibit a temporal
  formula.
* **`NF`'s discreteness is a genuine hypothesis**, carried by `natFrame`'s `[SuccOrder D]` and
  `[NoMaxOrder D]` binders, not a convenience of the presentation. In a *dense* order the cone
  around a state is all of `W` and the frame's *Limit* field fails outright, so this particular
  witness does not survive relaxing the carrier.
