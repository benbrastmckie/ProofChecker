# Semantics/Frames

The standard-frame index: the small number of concrete `TaskFrame`s the development builds
directly, together with a linked census of every other standard frame in the tree.

A concrete frame is expensive to build — every one of `def:frame`'s four axioms must be
discharged — so the ones that exist are reused rather than rebuilt, and this directory is where
a reader looks for one before writing another.
