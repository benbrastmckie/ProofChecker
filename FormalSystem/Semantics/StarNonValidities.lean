# Non-validities of `⊡` on the permissive frame over ℤ

Machine-checked refutations of the candidate `⊡`/tense interaction principles that are **not**
axioms of TM⋆ (`StarLanguage/Axioms.lean`). Every refutation lives on one countermodel: the
permissive frame `natFrame` over `ℤ` (`Semantics/TaskFrame.lean`), where every function
`ℤ → ℕ` is a total history, so `⟨τ⟩_t` is as large as it can be; the valuation makes every atom
true at world state `0` and nowhere else.

| Name | Refuted schema | What it shows |
|------|----------------|---------------|
| `refute_stab_box` | `⊡p → □⊡p` | `⊡` does not collapse into `□` |
| `refute_allFuture_stab` | `G⊡p → ⊡Gp` | the converse of GS fails, even for atoms |
| `refute_stab_allFuture_past` | `⊡GPp → G⊡Pp` | GS (`stab_allFuture_valid`) genuinely needs its pure-future side condition |
| `refute_determined` | `Fp → ⊡Fp` | *Determined* (paper line 1426) is refuted over a non-deterministic frame |
| `refute_somePast_stab` | `P⊡p → ⊡Pp` | `⟨τ⟩_t` is not closed towards the past |

On `refute_determined`: this module lands only the refutation over a non-deterministic frame
(the paper's `app:non-deterministic`, in the `natFrame` shape); validity of the *Determined*
schema over deterministic frames is **not** formalized here, and no claim about the class of
frames validating it is made.

On `refute_allFuture_stab` / `refute_stab_allFuture_past`: GS (`Semantics/StarPasting.lean`,
`stab_allFuture_valid`) is `⊡Gφ → G⊡φ` for **pure-future** `φ`. The second refutation shows the
restriction is necessary — with `φ := Pp` the pasted history keeps `τ`'s past, not the
witness's, and `Pp` flips — and the first shows the converse direction is simply wrong.

`refute_somePast_stab` is the `⊡`-analogue of the single tense/modal interaction axiom of
T×W / Ockhamist logic (Kamp's AK12 in Thomason 1984 §4; Reynolds 2003's HN), and it fails here
because `⟨τ⟩_t` is defined by a same-time condition, with no backward closure.

## Provenance

Transcription of Part D of the compiled stability-modal probes recorded with the research on the
`⊡` axiomatization; proofs unchanged.
