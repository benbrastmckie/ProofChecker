# `Prod.Lex` successor/predecessor infrastructure at `α ×ₗ ℤ`

Supplies the `SuccOrder` and `PredOrder` instances the pinned Mathlib lacks for `Prod.Lex`, so
that a lexicographic product over `ℤ` can serve as a duration carrier — at `ℚ ×ₗ ℤ` for
`Metalogic/Conservativity/Z1Countermodel.lean`'s CEF-closing countermodel (discharging
`bl_soundness_ztime_succ`'s `[SuccOrder] [PredOrder]` binders, report §6.1), and at `ℤ ×ₗ ℤ`
for `Metalogic/Independence/LexIntWitness.lean`'s `Sat .ZTime` separation.

## The first factor is arbitrary; only the second must be `ℤ`

Nothing below uses any property of `ℚ`. `lexSucc_le_iff` and `le_lexPred_iff` go through
`Prod.Lex.le_iff'` / `Prod.Lex.lt_iff'` and `Int.lt_iff_add_one_le`, all of which constrain only
the *second* factor. The file is therefore stated at an arbitrary ordered abelian group `α` in
the first coordinate, and both consumers are instantiations. The two carriers behave differently
in exactly one respect — a dense `α` such as `ℚ` makes the first coordinate un-steppable, a
discrete `α` such as `ℤ` does not — and that difference is invisible to everything here, because
the successor and predecessor functions never touch the first coordinate either way.

## Confirming the Mathlib gap

Under the pinned Mathlib version there is no `SuccOrder (α ×ₗ β)` / `PredOrder (α ×ₗ β)` instance
anywhere in the tree: `Mathlib/Order/SuccPred/Basic.lean` and every other `SuccPred` file
mention neither `Lex` nor `Prod`, and the only lexicographic `SuccOrder`/`PredOrder` instances in
the pinned snapshot are the unrelated `Lex (Π₀ i, α i)` (`Data/DFinsupp/Lex.lean`) and
`Lex R⟦Γ⟧` (`RingTheory/HahnSeries/Lex.lean`) constructions. So this file is not redundant with
anything upstream.

## What *is* already free from Mathlib

`AddCommGroup (α ×ₗ ℤ)` and `LinearOrder (α ×ₗ ℤ)` synthesize with no help: `Lex.instAddCommGroup`
(`Algebra/Order/Group/Synonym.lean`, the additive counterpart of `Lex.instCommGroup`) transfers
`AddCommGroup (α × ℤ)` straight across the `Lex` type synonym, and `Prod.Lex.instLinearOrder`
(`Data/Prod/Lex.lean`) builds the lexicographic linear order from `LinearOrder α` and
`LinearOrder ℤ` directly. `IsOrderedAddMonoid (α ×ₗ ℤ)` is also free, via the `to_additive`
counterpart of `Prod.Lex.isOrderedMonoid` (`Algebra/Order/Monoid/Prod.lean`), whose hypotheses
(`AddLeftStrictMono` on the *first* factor, full `IsOrderedAddMonoid` on the *second*) both hold.
`Nontrivial (α ×ₗ ℤ)` is immediate from `Nontrivial ℤ` and needs nothing of `α`. The `example`s
below pin all four as already-inferred instances, so `TemporalOrder.of (α ×ₗ ℤ)` elaborates with
no local instance work — only the successor/predecessor structure is new.

**This instance-pinning ritual is deliberately carried once.** `LexIntWitness.lean` used to
repeat the same four `example`s at `ℤ ×ₗ ℤ`; that copy is gone, and the generic block below
covers both carriers.

## The successor and predecessor functions

`succ (a, n) = (a, n + 1)` and `pred (a, n) = (a, n - 1)`: only the *second* (`ℤ`) component
moves, since the first component has no successor structure to advance along. Built via
`SuccOrder.ofSuccLeIff`/`PredOrder.ofPredLeIff`, which need only a `Preorder`.

## Main results

* `LexInt.instSuccOrder`, `LexInt.instPredOrder` — the two missing instances
* `LexInt.isLeast_pos` — `toLex (0, 1)` is the least strictly positive element
* `LexInt.not_isSuccArchimedean`, `LexInt.not_isPredArchimedean`, `LexInt.not_archimedean` — the
  three non-Archimedean facts, as **citable theorems** rather than `example`s

New content rather than a move: this file builds `SuccOrder`/`PredOrder` from hand-written
`succ`/`pred` functions and never had an `IsLeast {x | 0 < x}` theorem at all.
`DurationClassification.isLeast_succ_of_isLeast_pos` and `isGreatest_pred_of_isLeast_pos` turn
this one fact into the immediate-neighbour statements a `.ZTime` frame-class membership
argument needs, so a consumer never has to redo the coordinate bookkeeping.

/-! ## `α ×ₗ ℤ` is not Archimedean, in any of the three senses

These three were `example`s, which cannot be cited. They are theorems now, because
`LexIntWitness.lean`'s `lexIntStaticFrame_not_sat` needs exactly the third of them, and the
first two document the same obstruction at the successor structure this file builds.

All three need `[Nontrivial α]`: over a trivial first factor `α ×ₗ ℤ` is order-isomorphic to `ℤ`
and every one of the three properties *holds*. The obstruction is precisely that the first
coordinate has room the second coordinate's steps can never cross.
-/

/--
**`α ×ₗ ℤ` is not successor-Archimedean.** For `a < b` in `α`, the points `(a, 0)` and `(b, 0)`
are related by `≤`, yet no finite number of `succ` steps — which only ever advance the second
coordinate — can move the first coordinate from `a` to `b`.

**`α ×ₗ ℤ` is not Archimedean.**

A different proposition from `not_isSuccArchimedean`, not a restatement of it: `Archimedean` is
about `nsmul` multiples of a positive element, `IsSuccArchimedean` about iterates of `Order.succ`.
Here `toLex (0, 1)`'s multiples never move the first coordinate off `0`, so they never dominate
`toLex (b - a, 0)` for `a < b`.
