# Iterated Temporal Operators

`iterF` and `iterP` -- the n-fold applications of the F (`someFuture`) and P (`somePast`)
operators -- together with their complexity, injectivity, nesting-depth and
closure-escape lemmas.

These are pure syntax: nothing here mentions maximal consistent sets, derivability, frame
classes, or the `Succ` relation. They were relocated verbatim from
`Metalogic/Bundle/CanonicalTaskRelation.lean`, whose bounded-witness corollary is their
original consumer, so that `Metalogic/Core/RestrictedMCS/Basic.lean` could reach them without
the `Core -> Bundle` directory import edge that relocation removed.

## Main Definitions

- `iterF`: n-fold application of the F (`someFuture`) operator
- `iterP`: n-fold application of the P (`somePast`) operator
- `closureFBound` / `closurePBound`: iteration counts past which the iterate leaves
  `closureWithNeg`

## Main Theorems

- `iter_F_injective` / `iter_P_injective`: distinct iteration counts give distinct formulas
- `iter_F_leaves_closure` / `iter_P_leaves_closure`: the iterate at the bound is outside
  `closureWithNeg`

## Iterated F Helper

The `iterF` function applies the F (someFuture) operator n times.
This is used in the bounded witness corollary.

/--
n-fold application of the F (someFuture) operator.

- `iterF 0 φ = φ`

Helper lemmas establishing that iterF produces distinct formulas with
strictly increasing complexity. These are used to prove f_nesting_boundary.

## iterF and F-Nesting Depth

These lemmas connect iterF with the fNestingDepth measure from SubformulaClosure,
enabling proofs that iterF eventually leaves closureWithNeg.
-/

/-- F-nesting depth of iterF n phi is n + fNestingDepth phi.

This is the key lemma connecting iterF iteration count to fNestingDepth.
Since fNestingDepth counts consecutive outermost F applications, and iterF
applies F n times at the outermost level, the depth increases by n.
-/

/-- The bound on n for iterF to leave closureWithNeg.

If n > maxFDepthInClosure(phi), then iterF n phi is not in closureWithNeg(phi).
We define closureFBound as max_F_depth + 1 to get the first n that leaves the closure.
-/
def closureFBound (phi : Formula) : Nat :=
  max (FormalSystem.Syntax.maxFDepthInClosure phi) 1 + 1

/-- iterF exceeds the max F-depth bound for large n.

If n >= closureFBound(phi), then the fNestingDepth of iterF n phi

/-- **Main Theorem**: iterF n phi is not in closureWithNeg(phi) for large enough n.

This is the key result establishing that iterF eventually leaves any fixed closure.
The proof uses fNestingDepth: if iterF n phi were in closureWithNeg(phi),
its fNestingDepth would be bounded by maxFDepthInClosure(phi), but
iterF increases depth beyond that bound.

/--
n-fold application of the P (somePast) operator.

- `iterP 0 φ = φ`

This captures "P^n(φ)" notation, symmetric to iterF.

## iterP and P-Nesting Depth

These lemmas connect iterP with the pNestingDepth measure from SubformulaClosure,
enabling proofs that iterP eventually leaves closureWithNeg.
Symmetric to the iterF and fNestingDepth lemmas.
-/

/-- P-nesting depth of iterP n phi is n + pNestingDepth phi.

This is the key lemma connecting iterP iteration count to pNestingDepth.
Since pNestingDepth counts consecutive outermost P applications, and iterP
applies P n times at the outermost level, the depth increases by n.
-/
theorem iter_P_p_nesting_depth (n : Nat) (phi : Formula) :
