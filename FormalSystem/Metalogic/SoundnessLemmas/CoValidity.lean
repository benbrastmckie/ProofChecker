# Semantic Validity of the Paper's CO Principle

The JPL paper's `def:TMplus-c` singles out one extra axiom, **CO**, for the complete-order
extension of the base tense logic:

  `CO(φ) := △(Hφ → F(Hφ)) → (Hφ → Gφ)`

with `△` the *temporal* triangle `△ψ = Hψ ∧ ψ ∧ Gψ` (`Formula.always`). This module proves
that every CO instance is valid on dense Dedekind-complete flows, i.e.
`co_valid : ValidRTime (Formula.co φ)`.

## Why this file exists

This repository's official Dedekind-class axiom basis is the Reynolds triple
`Axiom.prior_U_gap` / `Axiom.prior_S_gap` / `Axiom.sep`; CO is **not** an `Axiom`
constructor here. `co_valid` is therefore not a soundness case — nothing in the soundness
induction consumes it. It is an *independent semantic check* on the formalization: the
proof-theoretic companion `FormalSystem.Theorems.DedekindDerived.co_derived` derives CO from
the Reynolds basis, and soundness applied to that derivation must land on exactly the statement
proved here. Agreement of the two routes is the intended consistency check; a mismatch would
mean `Formula.co` transcribes the paper formula incorrectly.

## Proof shape

A direct least-upper-bound argument, mirroring `prior_U_gap_valid`
(`FormalSystem/Metalogic/Soundness.lean`). Given `△(Hφ → F Hφ)` and `Hφ` at `t`, and a
putative `v > t` with `¬φ`, the set

  `A := {u | t ≤ u ∧ Hφ holds at u}`

contains `t`, is bounded above by `v`, and its supremum `s` again satisfies `Hφ` (any `r < s`
is undercut by a member of `A` above it). The `△`-antecedent applied at `s` — its middle
conjunct when `s = t`, its `G` conjunct when `t < s` — then yields `s' > s` with `Hφ` at `s'`,
so `s' ∈ A` sits above its own supremum. Contradiction.

## Main results

- `co_valid`: `ValidRTime (Formula.co φ)`.

**Validity of the paper's CO principle** on dense Dedekind-complete flows:

  `⊨_dc  △(Hφ → F(Hφ)) → (Hφ → Gφ)`.

**Hypotheses actually consumed.** Only the least-upper-bound hypothesis `h_lub` and the linear
order. The proof uses no `DenselyOrdered`, no `Nontrivial`, no `AddCommGroup` /
`IsOrderedAddMonoid` structure, and no shift-closure assumption — exactly as with the two Prior
gap lemmas (see the note preceding `prior_U_gap_valid` in `Metalogic/Soundness.lean`). CO is
thus valid on *every* Dedekind-complete linear order, `ℤ` included. The `DenselyOrdered` binder
is carried here only for chain consistency with the rest of the `ValidRTime` chain, not
because the mathematics needs it.

**Status of CO in this repository.** CO is a derived object, not a primitive: the official
Dedekind-class basis remains `Axiom.prior_U_gap` / `Axiom.prior_S_gap` / `Axiom.sep`, and the
Hilbert-side companion is `FormalSystem.Theorems.DedekindDerived.co_derived`. See
`Formula.co` for the source citation and the operator-resolution warning.
