# WeakCanonical — Weak Canonical Model Construction

Weak canonical model construction for Base TM completeness (Henkin-style approach).

This directory implements completeness for the Base TM logic variant via a reflexive
canonical model. The approach generalizes the classical Henkin construction to the
bimodal setting with temporal operators, using bisimulation equivalence games to
characterize expressive power and establishing completeness via normal-form reduction.

Measured live contents: **19 loose modules and 8 subdirectories**.
The aggregator for this directory is the sibling `Metalogic/WeakCanonical.lean`, not a self-named
file inside it. Counts above are measured and exclude the archive. `Kamp/` used to carry its own
local `Boneyard/`, which meant a filter naming only the top-level archive counted it as live;
the two archives are now consolidated at [`FormalSystem/Boneyard/`](../../Boneyard/README.md) and
B0 asserts the directory count is exactly 1. Run `scripts/check-module-invariants.sh` rather than
an ad-hoc `find` to re-derive live counts.

## Key Results

- `countermodel_discrete` (`GroupModel/CountermodelBase.lean:142`): the discrete countermodel at
  the non-Archimedean carrier `ℚ ×ₗ ℤ`, off `companionChronicle`. It is the Base-frame discrete
  branch of the flagship `completeness`.
- `truth_transfer` (`Transfer.lean:359`): truth transfers across the signature/atom-map layer,
  the terminus of the transfer development.
- `TruthLemma.lean` supplies the MCS-membership characterizations the construction consumes:
  `bot_not_in_mcs`, `G_forward_mcs`, `G_backward_mcs`, `H_forward_mcs`, `H_backward_mcs`.

Both flagship results above are `SORRY-FREE (sorryAx-free; axioms: exactly propext,
Classical.choice, Quot.sound)`.

## Architecture

       |        |
       +-- NEquivalence.lean

```

`ExpressiveCompleteness/` was consolidated into
[`FormalSystem/Boneyard/Kamp/KampWeakCanonical/ExpressiveCompleteness`](../../Boneyard/Kamp/KampWeakCanonical/ExpressiveCompleteness/README.md)
and is no longer part of the live architecture.
