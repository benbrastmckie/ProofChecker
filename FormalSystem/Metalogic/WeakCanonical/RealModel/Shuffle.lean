# Reynolds §8 Lemma 13 and the `ℚ`-shuffle

Reynolds 1992, *An Axiomatization for Until and Since over the Reals without the IRR Rule*,
§8 *"Doets' Theorem"*, printed **pp.186-187**.

This module continues Block H. Phase 24 landed Lemma 11 (`reynolds_lemma11`) in `GoodDense.lean`
and Phase 25 landed Lemma 12 (`epsDense`, `SimDense`, `contempEquivDense_epsDense_iff`) in
`EpsilonDense.lean`. Here we land the last of §8's numbered lemmas — Lemma 13, *"if there are no
`∼_M` classes ending at gaps then they are all closed intervals"* — and the special sum Reynolds
calls the **shuffle**, together with the `≡ₖ` fact the main proof extracts from it.

## The source, verbatim

Printed p.186, the definition of the shuffle:

> We will make crucial use of a special type of sum. Now suppose that `S` is a finite set of
> structures. Let `π : ℚ → S` be any map such that for any `M ∈ S`, for any `r, s ∈ ℚ`, there is
> `t ∈ ℚ` such that `r < t < s` and `π(t) = M`. We call the structure `Σ_{t ∈ ℚ} π(t)` the
> *shuffle* over `S`. It can be shown to be well defined up to isomorphism.

Printed p.187, **Lemma 13** — statement and whole proof:

> **LEMMA 13.** *For any structure `M`, if there are no `∼_M` classes ending at gaps then they
> are all closed intervals, i.e. of forms `(-∞, +∞)`, `(-∞, b]`, `[b, +∞)` or `[b, b']`.*
>
> **PROOF.** We know that the classes are intervals, we must rule out the case of a `∼_M`-class
> ending at an excluded point of `M`. By considering mirrors we may as well, for contradiction,
> suppose that `b ∈ M` is the right hand end point of `c`'s class `E` but that `b ∉ E`.
>
> Clearly `M | E` is very good so that its substructure `M | (c, b)` is too. This is the
> contradiction. ∎

Printed p.187, the shuffle step of Doets' theorem, which `kEquiv_shuffle_of_classIso` below
renders:

> Since we have density of `M / ∼`, the classes in `I = {E | E is a ∼-class strictly between c
> and d}` have order type `ℚ`. Also, by minimality of `G`, all the `γᵢ`'s in `G` are satisfied
> densely in `I`. This means that as far as `≡ₖ` is concerned `⋃ I` might as well be a shuffle as
> we now proceed to define.
>
> For each `γ ∈ G`, choose an `N_γ ⊨ γ` with flow of time an interval of `ℝ`. It is clear that
> for any `E ∈ I`, `M | E ≡ₖ N_γ` for one of the `γ`'s in `G`. Since lexicographic sums preserve
> `k`-equivalence we can choose `σ : ℚ → {N_γ | γ ∈ G}` appropriately so that
>
> `M | (⋃ I) = Σ_{E ∈ I} M | E ≡ₖ Σ_{q ∈ ℚ} σ(q)`,
>
> the latter structure being a shuffle over `{N_γ | γ ∈ G}`.

## Honesty charter notes

**Lemma 13's hypotheses are strengthened, and the strengthening is real.** Reynolds states the
lemma *"for any structure `M`"*. His one-line proof turns on *"clearly `M | E` is very good"*,
and `veryGoodDense` (`GoodDense.lean:251`) — faithfully following his own §8 definition —
demands that every open subinterval be **non-empty**. At a structure with an immediate successor
pair `p ⋖ q` inside a class, `M | (p,q)` is empty, so `M | E` is *not* very good and the
one-liner fails. Getting from *very good* to *good* is Lemma 11, which is stated for
**countable** structures. Both extra hypotheses are exactly the standing hypotheses of the
theorem this lemma feeds (Doets' theorem, printed p.185: *"whose flow of time is countable,
dense and without end points"*), so nothing downstream is weakened; but the statement here is
not the letter of the printed one. See `reynolds_lemma13_right`.

**Well-definedness of the shuffle is landed only in its reindexing form.** Reynolds' *"it can be
shown to be well defined up to isomorphism"* is the colour-preserving Cantor back-and-forth for
finitely many colours dense in `ℚ`, which Mathlib does not carry
(`Order.iso_of_countable_dense` is the uncoloured statement). What is landed here is
`shuffle_congr_orderIso` / `kEquiv_shuffle_congr`: the shuffle is invariant under any
colour-preserving order isomorphism of the index, which is the form the downstream proof
consumes. The full back-and-forth is *not* proved here and is *not* used; see the module's
`FOLLOW-UP` note below.

**FOLLOW-UP** (not blocking any downstream phase): the colour-preserving back-and-forth
*"any two dense `π, π' : ℚ → S` give isomorphic shuffles"* is unformalised. No result in this
tree depends on it — the main proof only ever needs one shuffle, produced from the classes
themselves by `kEquiv_shuffle_of_classIso`.

**Lemma 13, right-hand half** — Reynolds 1992, §8, printed p.187.

*"We must rule out the case of a `∼_M`-class ending at an excluded point of `M`."* If `t`'s class
does not end in a gap on the right and is bounded above by some point not in it, then it has a
**last point**: the class is closed on the right.

Reynolds' contradiction is exactly the last step: a first point `b` past the class would make
`M | (t,b)` very good, hence `t ∼ b`, putting `b` inside the class after all.

**Hypotheses beyond the printed statement**: `Countable` and `DenselyOrdered`. See the module
header — the printed *"for any structure `M`"* does not survive the non-emptiness clause of
`veryGoodDense`, and both hypotheses are standing ones for the theorem this feeds.

The four printed forms are the four combinations of *bounded/unbounded* on each side; the content
is that **whenever a class is bounded on a side, the bound is attained**, which is the two
conclusions below. That the classes are intervals at all is Lemma 12's `simDense_convex`
(`EpsilonDense.lean:199`), cited by Reynolds' own opening *"we know that the classes are
intervals"*.

/-! ## Reindexing a lexicographic sum along an order isomorphism

`doets_lemma_1_4` (`OrderedSum.lean:41`) compares two sums **over the same index set**. Reynolds'
shuffle step compares a sum over the set `I` of `∼`-classes with a sum over `ℚ`, along the order
isomorphism `I ≃o ℚ` supplied by *"the classes in `I` … have order type `ℚ`"* (printed p.187).
The bridge is purely order-theoretic: relabelling the index of a lexicographic sum by an order
isomorphism is an isomorphism of structures, hence a `k`-equivalence.

/-! ## The shuffle

Printed p.186: *"suppose that `S` is a finite set of structures. Let `π : ℚ → S` be any map such
that for any `M ∈ S`, for any `r, s ∈ ℚ`, there is `t ∈ ℚ` such that `r < t < s` and `π(t) = M`.
We call the structure `Σ_{t∈ℚ} π(t)` the shuffle over `S`."*

The finite set `S` is carried as a `Finset` of an index type `ι` together with a family
`N : ι → OrderedMonadicStructure sig`, rather than as a `Finset` of structures: structures do not
carry `DecidableEq`, and Reynolds' own use instantiates `ι` at the `γ`'s of `G`, which do.

/-- **The shuffle** `Σ_{t∈ℚ} π(t)` over a family of structures (printed p.186).

The density condition `IsShuffleMap` is *not* baked into the definition: the sum
`Σ_{t∈ℚ} N(π t)` makes sense for any `π`, and every result below that needs density takes it as
a hypothesis. This keeps the congruence lemmas free of a side condition they do not use. -/

This is the reindexing half of Reynolds' *"it can be shown to be well defined up to
isomorphism"* (printed p.186), and the half the downstream proof uses. The other half — that
**any** two dense `π, π'` over the same `S` are related by such an `e`, by a colour-preserving
Cantor back-and-forth — is not formalised here; see the module header's `FOLLOW-UP`. -/

/-- **`Σ_{E∈I} M|E ≡ₖ Σ_{q∈ℚ} σ(q)`** — Reynolds 1992, §8, printed p.187, the shuffle step of
Doets' theorem:

> *Since we have density of `M/∼`, the classes in `I = {E | E is a ∼-class strictly between c and
> d}` have order type `ℚ`. Also, by minimality of `G`, all the `γᵢ`'s in `G` are satisfied densely
> in `I`. … Since lexicographic sums preserve `k`-equivalence we can choose
> `σ : ℚ → {N_γ | γ ∈ G}` appropriately so that*
>
> `M | (⋃ I) = Σ_{E∈I} M|E ≡ₖ Σ_{q∈ℚ} σ(q)`,
>
> *the latter structure being a shuffle over `{N_γ | γ ∈ G}`.*

The three hypotheses are Reynolds' three inputs, made explicit:

* `e : I ≃o ℚ` is *"the classes in `I` have order type `ℚ`"*;
* `hmatch` is *"it is clear that for any `E ∈ I`, `M|E ≡ₖ N_γ` for one of the `γ`'s in `G`"*,
  together with the choice of `σ` that *"we can choose appropriately"* refers to;
* `hdense` is *"all the `γᵢ`'s in `G` are satisfied densely in `I`"*, i.e. that the resulting `σ`
  really is a shuffle map.

`hdense` is carried but not consumed: it is what makes the right-hand side a *shuffle* rather
than an arbitrary `ℚ`-sum, which is what Phase 27 needs of it, and stating the theorem without it
would silently drop the source's density requirement. -/

/-! ## `M | (⋃I) = Σ_{E∈I} M|E`

Reynolds writes the left-hand identity of

`M | (⋃ I) = Σ_{E∈I} M|E ≡ₖ Σ_{q∈ℚ} σ(q)`

as an identity (printed p.187), on the strength of *"`∼_M` partitions `M` into intervals"*
(Lemma 12, clause (ii); here `simDense_convex`). Formally it is an isomorphism, not an equality,
so it is landed as a `≡ₖ` like every other step.

The decomposition is stated for an arbitrary **order-respecting block map** `cls` rather than for
the `∼`-quotient specifically: what the proof uses is only that points in an earlier block
precede points in a later one, and stating it that way keeps the lemma free of quotient
machinery. At the call site `cls` is *"the `∼`-class of"*, `I` is Reynolds' `I` and the
hypothesis is convexity of the classes.
-/

/-- The substructure of `M` on an arbitrary subset of its carrier.

The tree's existing cuts (`subinterval`, `openSubinterval`, `belowSubinterval`,
`aboveSubinterval`) are all interval-shaped; the blocks of a partition are given as sets, so this

**A structure is the lexicographic sum of its blocks** — the left-hand identity
`M | (⋃ I) = Σ_{E∈I} M|E` of Reynolds 1992, §8, printed p.187.

`cls` assigns each point its block; `hmono` is *"the blocks are intervals, ordered by `I`"* in the
only form the proof uses: a point of an earlier block precedes a point of a later one. Blocks are
allowed to be empty — an empty summand contributes no points to the sum, so no surjectivity of
`cls` is required.

**`M | (⋃ I) ≡ₖ Σ_{q∈ℚ} σ(q)`** — Reynolds 1992, §8, printed p.187, assembled: the block
decomposition of the interval followed by the shuffle comparison.

This is the phase's deliverable for the main proof: `P` is `M | (⋃ I)`, `cls` is *"the `∼`-class
of"*, `e : I ≃o ℚ` is *"the classes in `I` have order type `ℚ`"*, and `hmatch` is *"for any
`E ∈ I`, `M|E ≡ₖ N_γ` for one of the `γ`'s in `G`"* with `σ` the choice of `γ` per rational.

/-- A **monotone** block labelling is order-respecting, which is the hypothesis
`kEquiv_orderedSum_blocks` asks for.

This is the form the `∼`-quotient supplies: *"`∼_M` partitions `M` into intervals"* (Lemma 12,
clause (ii), landed as `simDense_convex`) says exactly that the class labelling is monotone, and
monotonicity alone gives the strict form. -/

/-- **Anti-vacuity for the block decomposition**: the singleton partition.

Labelling each point by itself makes every block a singleton, and the decomposition reads
`P ≡ₖ Σ_{x∈P} P|{x}` — a non-trivial instance of `kEquiv_orderedSum_blocks` with a genuinely
inhabited index and genuinely inhabited blocks, so the general lemma is not vacuously about
empty sums. It is also the degenerate shuffle Reynolds' `σ*` uses at the irrationals
(printed p.188). -/
