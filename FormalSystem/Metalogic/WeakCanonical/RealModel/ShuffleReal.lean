# The `ℝ`-extension of the shuffle

Reynolds 1992, *An Axiomatization for Until and Since over the Reals without the IRR Rule*,
§8 *"Doets' Theorem"*, printed **p.188**.

`Shuffle.lean` landed the `ℚ`-shuffle `Σ_{q∈ℚ} σ(q)` and the identification
`M | (⋃ I) ≡ₖ Σ_{q∈ℚ} σ(q)`. This module takes the next step of the printed proof: replace the
`ℚ`-indexed shuffle by an `ℝ`-indexed one, and establish the four order-theoretic properties of
the resulting flow that Phase 28's characterization of `ℝ` consumes.

## The source, verbatim

Printed p.188:

> Now let `σ*` be the extension of `σ` to `ℝ` given by `σ*(i) = N_{γ₁}` for `i ∈ ℝ − ℚ`, where
> `γ₁` is a `γ` in `G` which is only satisfied by one point structures. By another simple game
> argument we have `Σ_{q∈ℚ} σ(q) ≡ₖ Σ_{r∈ℝ} σ*(r)`.
>
> Let `R` be the flow of time of `Σ_{r∈ℝ} σ*(r)`. Clearly `R` is dense and without end points.
> `R` is also Dedekind complete: any subset bounded above intersects a last summand. Because the
> `γᵢ`'s say so the summands themselves are closed intervals of the reals so the supremum of the
> set exists in this class. Also `R` has a countable dense subflow.
>
> But then `R` being Dedekind complete, dense, without end points and with a countable dense
> subset must be isomorphic to the reals.

## What is landed here

`shuffleColourReal` is `σ*`; `shuffleReal` is `Σ_{r∈ℝ} σ*(r)`.

**This module is sorry-free and unconditional**, as is the whole of `FormalSystem/` outside
`Boneyard/` — check C3 of `scripts/check-module-invariants.sh` pins the structural-`sorry`
inventory at zero by content.

**`doets_lemma_1_5` is proved.** Reynolds' *"another simple game argument"* is one clause long
and is not a proof. The result it names is **Doets 1987, 3.1.8** — the *mixing* lemma:

> if `(I, {i | m(i) ⊨ σ})_{σ∈Z} ≡ⁿ (J, {j | m'(j) ⊨ σ})_{σ∈Z}` then
> `Σ_{i∈I} m(i) ≡ⁿ Σ_{j∈J} m'(j)`

which reduces the claim to a `≡ⁿ` fact about the `Z`-coloured index orders. That is the form
`doets_lemma_1_5` below carries, with `Z` taken to be `KType sig k` (finite, by
`normalFormFintype`) and the colouring of an index the `k`-type of its summand — literally
*"which sentences of `Z` the summand satisfies"*.

Its proof is `kEquiv_orderedSum_of_kEquiv_colour` (`MixedSum.lean`) — a genuine
Ehrenfeucht-Fraïssé argument on the sums, generalizing `doets_lemma_1_4`'s (`OrderedSum.lean`)
normal-form induction from a *shared* index set to a *coloured back-and-forth between two
different* index sets. The engine underneath it is `BackAndForth.lean`'s `BackForth` and
`kEquiv_iff_backForth`, together with `MixedSum.lean`'s `Mixed` relation and `backForth_of_mixed`.

**The `≡ₖ` fact about the coloured index orders themselves is proved too** — that `(ℚ, σ)` and
`(ℝ, σ*)`, both densely coloured by the same finite palette, are `≡ₖ`. It is
`kEquiv_colourStructure` (`ColourOrders.lean`). It was once carried as an explicit hypothesis
`hcol` of `kEquiv_shuffle_shuffleReal`; that hypothesis is gone, and the theorem's signature now
takes only the shuffle data `hγ` and `hσ` it was always a consequence of.

/-! ### The two shuffle colourings, in the form the coloured-order game consumes

`IsShuffleMap` / `IsShuffleMapReal` state Reynolds' density condition for the concrete index
orders `ℚ` and `ℝ`. `IsShuffleColouring` (`ColourOrders.lean`) states it for an arbitrary index
order, adding the endpoint and nonemptiness clauses that `ℚ` and `ℝ` satisfy outright. These two
lemmas are the bridge, and they are what lets `kEquiv_colourStructure` be applied to the pair
`(ℚ, σ)`, `(ℝ, σ*)`.

/-! ## Doets 1987, 3.1.8 — the mixing lemma

The `Z`-coloured index order of the source statement is rendered as a monadic structure in its
own right, over a signature whose predicate symbols *are* the colours. With `Z := KType sig k`
and the colour of an index `i` its summand's `k`-type, `colourStructure` is literally
`(I, {i | m(i) ⊨ σ})_{σ∈Z}`.

`colourSig`, `colourStructure` and `kTypeColouring` live in `ColourOrders.lean`, together with
the proof that any two shuffle colourings over a common palette give `≡ₖ` coloured orders. The
*mixing* half is `MixedSum.lean`'s `kEquiv_orderedSum_of_kEquiv_colour`; the statement is
restated here under Doets' numbering, which is how the rest of this file refers to it.
-/

/--
**Doets 1987, 3.1.8** — *the mixing lemma*:

> if `(I, {i | m(i) ⊨ σ})_{σ∈Z} ≡ⁿ (J, {j | m'(j) ⊨ σ})_{σ∈Z}` then
> `Σ_{i∈I} m(i) ≡ⁿ Σ_{j∈J} m'(j)`

This is the two-index generalization of `doets_lemma_1_4` (`OrderedSum.lean`), which is the
special case `I = J` with the identity colour-matching. It is what Reynolds 1992 (printed p.188)
invokes as *"another simple game argument"* when he passes from the `ℚ`-shuffle to its
`ℝ`-extension; he gives no proof, and the game argument is not simple.

**Proved** in `MixedSum.lean`, by the Ehrenfeucht-Fraïssé argument on the two sums: Duplicator's
strategy is assembled from a depth-`k` strategy on the coloured index orders together with, at
each matched pair of indices, a depth-`k` strategy inside the corresponding summands — available
because matched indices carry the same `k`-type, which is exactly what the hypothesis says.

`BackAndForth.lean` supplies the engine (`BackForth` for an arbitrary **pair** of structures, and
`kEquiv_iff_backForth` converting it to and from `≡ₖ`); `MixedSum.lean`'s `Mixed` is the invariant
that assembles the two families of strategies, and `backForth_of_mixed` runs the induction.

**Nothing in this module is conditional any longer.** The order-theoretic properties of `R`
(`denselyOrdered_orderedSumReal`, `noMax_orderedSumReal`, `noMin_orderedSumReal`,
`exists_isLUB_orderedSumReal`, `exists_countableDense_orderedSumReal`) were already proved
outright, and `kEquiv_shuffle_shuffleReal` — this lemma's only consumer — now is too.

**`Σ_{q∈ℚ} σ(q) ≡ₖ Σ_{r∈ℝ} σ*(r)`** — Reynolds 1992, §8, printed p.188.

`ADAPTED-FROM: Doets 1987, 3.1.8`. Reynolds asserts this in one clause — *"by another simple
game argument"* — without proof; the argument he is pointing at is Doets' mixing lemma, carried
here as `doets_lemma_1_5`.

The `≡ₖ` fact about the two **coloured index orders** that the mixing lemma reduces the claim to
— that `(ℚ, σ)` and `(ℝ, σ*)` satisfy the same monadic sentences of depth `≤ k` in the language
of the colours — is now **proved**, by `kEquiv_colourStructure` (`ColourOrders.lean`): both are
dense endpointless orders coloured by the same palette with every colour dense in every
interval, so the colour-preserving back-and-forth wins the depth-`k` game. It was carried as an
explicit hypothesis `hcol` while it was open; that hypothesis is gone, replaced by the shuffle
data `hγ` and `hσ` it was always a consequence of.

/-! ## The flow `R` of `Σ_{r∈ℝ} σ*(r)`

Printed p.188: *"Let `R` be the flow of time of `Σ_{r∈ℝ} σ*(r)`. Clearly `R` is dense and without
end points. `R` is also Dedekind complete: any subset bounded above intersects a last summand.
Because the `γᵢ`'s say so the summands themselves are closed intervals of the reals so the
supremum of the set exists in this class. Also `R` has a countable dense subflow."*

The four facts are proved for an arbitrary `ℝ`-indexed family and then specialized to the
shuffle, because none of them uses anything about the summands beyond the order-theoretic
hypotheses stated: nonemptiness, internal density, internal completeness with a least element,
internal separability, and — for the countable dense subflow only — that the summands at the
*irrationals* are subsingletons. That last hypothesis is where Reynolds' choice of `γ₁` as
*"a `γ` in `G` which is only satisfied by one point structures"* does its work: without it, `R`
would have `ℝ`-many pairwise-separated pairs of points and no countable dense subset.

`orderedSum` is deliberately not reducible (see its docstring), so the four small transfer lemmas
between the lexicographic order and its components are stated once here rather than unfolded at
each use.
-/

section OrderFacts

/-! The four transfer lemmas are stated through `orderedSumPt` (`NEquivalence.lean:155`) rather
than through an anonymous `⟨r, a⟩`. An anonymous sigma literal forces its expected type to weak
head normal form, which unfolds `.carrier` to the raw `Sigma` type; typeclass search then finds
Mathlib's *non-lexicographic* `Sigma.instLE` in preference to the structure's `carrierOrder`, and
the statement silently becomes one about the wrong order. This is exactly the hazard
`orderedSum`'s docstring warns about, met here for `LE` rather than for `LinearOrder`. -/

**`R` is Dedekind complete** — Reynolds 1992, §8, printed p.188:

> *`R` is also Dedekind complete: any subset bounded above intersects a last summand. Because
> the `γᵢ`'s say so the summands themselves are closed intervals of the reals so the supremum of

The transcription makes the printed sentence's two moves explicit and adds the case Reynolds'
*"intersects a last summand"* passes over. Let `ρ` be the supremum in `ℝ` of the indices met by
`T`, which exists because `ℝ` is complete.

* If `T` does meet the summand at `ρ` — Reynolds' *"intersects a last summand"* — the supremum is
  taken inside that summand, which is where *"the summands themselves are closed intervals of the
  reals"* is used: `hsum` says every inhabited subset of a summand has a least upper bound
  **in that summand**, which is exactly closedness on the right.
* If it does not, `ρ` is approached from below by indices met by `T` and the least point of the
  summand at `ρ` is the supremum; `hbot` — *"closed intervals"* again, now on the left — supplies
  it.

Stated as `∃ u, IsLUB T u` rather than through a `ConditionallyCompleteLinearOrder` instance:
the carrier is a `Sigma` type whose order comes from `orderedSum`'s `carrierOrder` field, and
registering a second order-theoretic instance on it is precisely the hazard `orderedSum`'s
docstring warns about.

**`R` has a countable dense subflow** — Reynolds 1992, §8, printed p.188 (*"Also `R` has a
countable dense subflow."*).

The witness is the union over the **rationals** of a countable dense subset of each rational
summand, together with one chosen point of each rational summand. Countability is then a
countable union of countable sets.

Density needs both hypotheses and shows what each is for. Two points in different summands are
separated by any point sitting over a rational strictly between their indices — this is why the
chosen basepoints are thrown in, since a subsingleton summand's dense subset is empty. Two
points in the *same* summand are separated inside it when the index is rational; when the index
is irrational, `hirr` says the summand is a subsingleton, so there is no such pair. That is
precisely Reynolds' reason for putting the one-point structures at `ℝ − ℚ`: a family of
non-degenerate summands over all of `ℝ` has no countable dense subset at all.

/-! ## The four facts at the `ℝ`-shuffle itself

`shuffleReal N γ₁ σ` is `orderedSum sig ℝ (fun r => N (σ* r))`, so the four facts above apply
verbatim once the hypotheses are read off the palette. `hone` is Reynolds' *"`γ₁` is a `γ` in `G`
which is only satisfied by one point structures"* (printed p.188) — the only place that clause is
used.

/-! ## Anti-vacuity: the hypothesis bundles are satisfiable

Every order fact above is stated under hypotheses on the summands, and would be worthless if no
family satisfied them. A witness is exhibited here: the constant `ℝ`-family of one-point
structures, which satisfies *all* of the hypotheses of *all five* lemmas simultaneously. This is
not an artificial witness — it is exactly what `σ*` produces at the irrationals (printed p.188,
`γ₁` *"only satisfied by one point structures"*), so the degenerate case is on the main path
rather than beside it.

/-! ## `R ≅o ℝ` — the last sentence of the printed paragraph

> But then `R` being Dedekind complete, dense, without end points and with a countable dense
> subset must be isomorphic to the reals.

The characterization itself is `orderIsoRealOfDedekindDenseSeparable`
(`RealModel/OrderIsoReal.lean`); this section only feeds it the five facts established above.

This is also the **non-trivial anti-vacuity instantiation** that `OrderIsoReal.lean`'s docstring
points at. It is not `ℝ` in disguise: the carrier of `shuffleReal N γ₁ σ` is a lexicographically
ordered `Sigma` type over `ℝ` whose fibres are the carriers of arbitrary monadic structures, and
the isomorphism to `ℝ` is a theorem about that type, not a re-labelling of `ℝ`.
