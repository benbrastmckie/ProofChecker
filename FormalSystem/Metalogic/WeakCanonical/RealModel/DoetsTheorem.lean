# Doets' Theorem — Reynolds §8 Theorem 6

Reynolds 1992, *An Axiomatization for Until and Since over the Reals without the IRR Rule*,
§8 *"Doets' Theorem"*, printed **pp.185-188**; attributed there to Doets 1987, 3.3.9, with
Reynolds' own note that

> This statement is slightly stronger than Doets' and the proof is a little different because of
> the contemporaneity notion.

## The source statement, verbatim (printed p.185)

> **THEOREM 6** *Suppose that `M` is a temporal structure in a finite language whose flow of time
> is countable, dense and without end points. Suppose further that for any contemporaneous
> equivalence relation `∼` on `M`,*
>
> *D1) the `∼` classes do not end in gaps and*
>
> *D2) if `M/∼` is densely ordered then `M/∼` has a dense set of singletons.*
>
> *Then for all `k < ω`, there is a temporal structure with flow of time the real numbers
> satisfying the same monadic first order sentences of quantifier depth at most `k` as `M` does.*

## What this module lands, and what it does not

This module is the **assembly point** for Block H. Its job is to take the finished Phase 24-28
assets and turn them into the `ℝ`-flow transfer statement that Reynolds' §9 Theorem 7 consumes.
Four layers, bottom-up:

1. **`ℝ`-flow normalization** (`exists_realFlow_witness`). `goodDense` hands back *some* interval
   of `ℝ`. Reynolds' conclusion asks for *the* real line. For a structure with no end points the
   two are the same up to order isomorphism, and the normalization is the same argument
   `exists_ioo_witness` (`GoodDense.lean:713`) already makes for bounded open intervals, with
   `Set.univ` as the target instead of `(c,d)`.
2. **`≅o ℝ ⇒ good`** (`goodDense_of_orderIso_real`). The converse direction: a structure whose
   flow is order-isomorphic to `ℝ` is good, with `Set.univ` as the witnessing interval. This is
   what makes Phase 28's `orderIsoRealOfDedekindDenseSeparable` usable as an *input* to goodness
   rather than only as an output.
3. **The `ℝ`-model transfer** (`goodDense_shuffleReal`, `goodDense_shuffle`). Reynolds' printed
   p.188 chain, composed: `Σ_{q∈ℚ} σ(q) ≡ₖ Σ_{r∈ℝ} σ*(r)` (`kEquiv_shuffle_shuffleReal`, Phase
   27 + `doets_lemma_1_5`), the flow of `Σ_{r∈ℝ} σ*(r)` is `≅o ℝ`
   (`nonempty_orderIso_real_shuffleReal`, Phase 27's five order facts + Phase 28's
   characterization), hence **both** shuffles are good. This is the step the printed proof states
   in one sentence and the step every remaining branch of Theorem 6 routes through.
4. **The theorem** (`doets_theorem_dense`), with D1 and D2 spelled as explicit hypotheses in the
   form Phase 30 consumes them.

## State of the main branch

Reynolds' proof of Theorem 6 (printed pp.187-188) is a proof by contradiction whose core is a
**minimality argument over the finite `γ`-palette `G`**: choose `a < b` with `a ≁ b` and `G`
minimal among all such choices, then show `M | (a,b)` is very good — contradicting `a ≁ b` via
Lemma 11. That argument is landed here, as `reynolds_theorem6_contradiction`, and so is everything
it routes through: the shuffle identification, the `ℝ`-extension, the order-isomorphism to `ℝ`, and
the `ℝ`-flow normalization. `doets_theorem_dense` is the printed statement with no added
hypotheses, and the whole chain is `sorry`-free and reports only `propext`, `Classical.choice` and
`Quot.sound`.

An earlier revision of this module carried the minimality argument as a named hypothesis of a
`doets_theorem_dense_core`; that declaration is gone, discharged rather than renamed.

/-! ## Layer 1 — `ℝ`-flow normalization

Reynolds' conclusion is *"a temporal structure with flow of time the real numbers"*, not *"an
interval of the real numbers"*. `goodDense` supplies the latter. For a structure with no end
points the gap is closed by `exists_orderIso_ioo01_of_ordConnected` (`GoodDense.lean:644`),
exactly as `exists_ioo_witness` closes it for a prescribed bounded open interval.
-/

/--
A `RIntervalStructure` whose flow is **all** of `ℝ`: the shape Reynolds' *"flow of time the real
numbers"* asks for.

`realLine` (`GoodDense.lean:1015`) is the same carrier set assembled from `ℤ`-indexed blocks;
this is the free-standing predicate on an already-built `RIntervalStructure`.

*"if `M` is good we are done"* — read with the theorem's standing *"whose flow of time is

Statement source: Reynolds, as quoted. Proof: the same three-step normalization
`exists_ioo_witness` (`GoodDense.lean:713`) makes — non-emptiness and both end-point conditions
travel across `≡ₖ` at `k ≥ 2`, so `exists_orderIso_ioo01_of_ordConnected` applies to the
witnessing interval — with `ℝ` itself as the destination rather than `(c,d)`.

/-! ## Layer 2 — a flow order-isomorphic to `ℝ` is good

The converse of Layer 1, and the step that makes Phase 28's characterization of `ℝ` an *input*
to goodness. Printed p.188 uses it in exactly this direction: having established that the flow
`R` of `Σ_{r∈ℝ} σ*(r)` *"is isomorphic to the reals"*, Reynolds concludes goodness and feeds it
back into Lemma 11's very-goodness test.
-/

/--
**A structure whose flow is order-isomorphic to `ℝ` is good** (printed p.188).

The witnessing interval is all of `ℝ`, with the predicates transported along the inverse
isomorphism, so the resulting `RIntervalStructure` also satisfies `IsRealFlow`.

/-! ## Layer 3 — the `ℝ`-model transfer

Printed p.188, the whole paragraph:

> Now let `σ*` be the extension of `σ` to `ℝ` … By another simple game argument we have
> `Σ_{q∈ℚ} σ(q) ≡ₖ Σ_{r∈ℝ} σ*(r)`.
>
> Let `R` be the flow of time of `Σ_{r∈ℝ} σ*(r)`. Clearly `R` is dense and without end points.
> `R` is also Dedekind complete … Also `R` has a countable dense subflow. Thus `R` is isomorphic
> to the reals.

Every clause of that paragraph is a finished theorem by the time this module is reached. What is
added here is the one-line consequence Reynolds leaves implicit and §9 Theorem 7 consumes: the
`ℚ`-shuffle — and hence, by Phase 26, `M | (⋃ I)` — is **good**, with the real line itself as its
flow.

The six hypotheses are exactly `isRealLike_shuffleReal`'s (`ShuffleReal.lean:625`), in the same
spelling: the summands are non-empty, internally dense, internally complete with a least element,
internally separable, and the distinguished colour `γ₁` names a one-point structure.

This is the form the main proof consumes: Reynolds establishes goodness *of the real extension*

`kEquiv_blocks_shuffle` identifies with `M | (⋃ I)`.

/-! ## Layer 4 — Doets' Theorem

Reynolds' hypotheses D1 and D2 are quantified over *"any contemporaneous equivalence relation
`∼` on `M`"*; the two conclusions are `EndsInGapOnRight`/`EndsInGapOnLeft` (`Defs.lean`) and
`QuotientDenselyOrdered → HasDenseSingletons` (`Singletons.lean,200`).

## Which spelling of *"contemporaneous equivalence relation"*, and why it changed

The antecedent is `IsContempEquivDenseOn ε (CountableDense sig)` (`Defs.lean`) — §6's
class-parameterized bundle read at the **countable dense** class, not the unrestricted
`IsContempEquivDense ε` an earlier version of this file used and not the intermediate
`IsContempEquivDenseCD ε` this file used between them. The reason is forced, not stylistic:

Theorem 6 runs D1 and D2 at `ε := epsDense sig k`, Reynolds' own `ε(x,y)` of §8 Lemma 12. That
`ε` satisfies the unrestricted clause (iii) but satisfies transitivity and convexity **only** at a
countable dense flow — `IsContempEquivDense (epsDense sig k)` is false, with the counterexample
in `EpsilonDense`'s module header. So the antecedent had to weaken to something `epsDense`
actually meets, or Theorem 6 could never apply its own hypotheses. `doetsD1_epsDense` /
`doetsD2_epsDense` below are that application, and they are the ε-adapter Phase 25's deviation
record asked for; `epsDense_isContempEquivDenseOn_countableDense` (`EpsilonDense.lean`) is the
witness they consume.

**Why `IsContempEquivDenseOn ε (CountableDense sig)` and not `IsContempEquivDenseCD ε`, and in
which direction that moves the theorem.** The three readings are ordered
`IsContempEquivDense → IsContempEquivDenseOn _ (CountableDense _) → IsContempEquivDenseCD`
(`isContempEquivDenseCD_of_countableDense`, `Defs.lean`), strongest requirement on `ε` first; the
last arrow is not reversible without unrestricted reflexivity and symmetry. D1 and D2 quantify
**over** `ε`, so a *stronger* antecedent admits *fewer* `ε` and makes D1/D2 *weaker* — hence
`doets_theorem_dense` *stronger*. Moving from `IsContempEquivDenseCD` to
`IsContempEquivDenseOn _ (CountableDense _)` therefore strengthens the theorem, and it stays
strictly stronger than Reynolds' own statement, whose D1/D2 quantify over the unrestricted
reading. `doetsD1_of_cd` / `doetsD2_of_cd` below check the strengthening rather than assert it:
anything that discharged the previous reading discharges this one.

**What the antecedent costs, stated plainly.** Weakening an antecedent makes the hypothesis
*harder* to discharge. `no_gaps_dense_prior` / `no_gaps_dense_prior_left` (`NoGaps.lean`) and
`dense_singletons_of_sep` (`Singletons.lean`) are what must supply it, and at the time this note
was first written they took the **unrestricted** `hε : IsContempEquivDense ε`, with
`IsContempEquivDense.toCD` running the wrong way to help. **That gap is now closed**: §6 is
stated against an arbitrary structure class `C` (`IsContempEquivDenseOn ε C`), so those three
theorems are available at `C := CountableDense sig` directly. The paragraphs below record the one
obstruction that closing it had to clear, because the record of that obstruction was wrong twice
and the corrections are worth keeping.

**That was not a formality, and the obstruction was exactly one site.** Restricting
`IsContempEquivDense`'s clauses and propagating the instances through §6 leaves one
place that needs work: `NoGaps.lean`'s `reynolds_lemma9` projects the clauses at
`surgeredStructure M ε Q t` and so demands `Countable` and `DenselyOrdered` of it.

**An earlier version of this note claimed that demand was unsatisfiable. That claim was wrong,
and it is corrected here rather than quietly dropped.** The argument recorded was: the surgered
structure collapses a bad interval to a single `∼`-class, and Lemma 4 (*"no first class in any
maximal interval"*) removes the classes below the surviving class `I`, so `I` becomes adjacent to
what precedes it. The premise is right and the conclusion does not follow — removing what is
below `I` produces adjacency only if `I` has a **least element**, and Lemma 4 quantifies over
**classes**, saying nothing about the points inside one. What this tree already proves is that
`I` has neither a first nor a last point: `IsBadIntervalSurgery.interior` supplies a
`ClassInteriorToBadInterval` at every point of `Q₀`, which carries both halves of Lemma 6's first
clause (*"in any bad interval both `R` and `L` hold throughout"*, printed p.180) — `.toR.rThroughout`
and `.lThroughout` — and `ρ`/`λ`'s second conjuncts (`exists_contemp_gt`, `exists_contemp_lt`)
then give class-mates strictly above and below every point of `I`. So `I` supplies survivors
arbitrarily close to its own edges and no adjacency appears.

Both instances are therefore **provable**, under exactly the hypotheses `reynolds_lemma9` already
carries, and both are landed and sorry-free in `NoGaps.lean`:
`countable_surgeredStructure` and `denselyOrdered_surgeredStructure`, the latter by a five-case
analysis on the two `SurgeryDomain` disjuncts of each endpoint. They are **derived**, not assumed,
so §6 Theorem 4 does not go vacuous — the failure mode the earlier note rightly feared is avoided
by proving the instances rather than hypothesizing them. The clauses of `hε` are projected only at
`M` in that proof, never at `N`, so there is no circularity.

The mechanical part — restating the §6 chain so the instances can be supplied at that one site —
is **done**: §6 now quantifies over a structure class and `reynolds_lemma9` gets its membership at
`surgeredStructure` from `instIsSurgeryClosedCountableDense` (`NoGaps.lean`). The obligation is
still recorded here in the type of D1/D2, where it names the class the suppliers run at.

**Failure of goodness produces two inequivalent points** — printed p.187, the opening move of
Theorem 6's proof by contradiction:

> So suppose that `M` is not good. Then `M` is not very good and so there are `a < b` in `M` with
> `a ≁ b`.

Both implications are Lemma 11 (`reynolds_lemma11_no_endpoints`, `GoodDense.lean:1115`) in
contrapositive form: applied at `M` itself for *"`M` is not very good"*, and applied at
`M | (t,u)` for the step from *"`M | (t,u)` is not good"* to *"`t ≁ u`"* — the middle clause of
`SimDense` (`EpsilonDense.lean:128`) asks for very-goodness of `M | (t,u)`, which at a countable
endpointless interval is goodness.

Density of `M` is what supplies `veryGoodDense`'s non-emptiness clause and both end-point
conditions on the open subintervals.

/-! ## Layer 5 — Reynolds' `G`, and its minimization

Printed p.187, the choice that opens the contradiction:

> Choose `a < b` from `M` such that
>
> - `a ≁ b` and
> - `G = {γᵢ | i = 1, …, s and ∃ ∼-class E strictly between a and b such that M | E ⊨ γᵢ}` has
>   minimal size.

and the use the choice is put to, three sentences later:

> Also, by minimality of `G`, all the `γᵢ`'s in `G` are satisfied densely in `I`.

**Two rendering decisions, both stated rather than assumed.**

*Reynolds' `G` is a set of sentences; this is a `Finset` of normal forms.* `gammaSentences`
(`EpsilonDense.lean:239`) is literally `(goodNFs sig k).toList.map nfToSentence`, so the `γᵢ` and
the elements of `goodNFs sig k` are the same data presented twice. The minimization is done at
the normal-form level because that is where `Finset.card` is available without needing
`nfToSentence` to be injective — and injectivity is not part of what the argument uses. The only
property of the size measure the proof consumes is that it is monotone under inclusion and
strictly so on proper subsets, which `Finset.card` supplies.

*`E` is named by a representative point.* A `∼`-class is `{x | x ∼ e}` for any of its members, so
*"∃ `∼`-class `E` strictly between `a` and `b`"* becomes *"∃ `e` all of whose `∼`-equals lie in
`(a,b)`"* (`ClassStrictlyBetween`). Reynolds' *"strictly between `a` and `b`"* is a condition on
the whole class, not on the representative — the classes are intervals but need not be singletons,
so quantifying over the class is what makes the monotonicity below true.
-/

/-- *"`E` is a `∼`-class strictly between `a` and `b`"* (printed p.187), with the class named by
a representative `e`: every point `∼`-equal to `e` lies strictly inside `(a,b)`.

Stated over the whole class rather than over `e` alone. That is what the source means and it is
also what `gammaBetween_subset` needs: shrinking `(a,b)` must not admit new classes. -/

**All the `γᵢ` in `G` are satisfied densely in `I`** — printed p.187, the sentence the shuffle
construction consumes:

> Also, by minimality of `G`, all the `γᵢ`'s in `G` are satisfied densely in `I`.

*Densely* is unpacked into the form the construction uses: given any sub-pair `c ≤ c' < d' ≤ d`
that is itself a `≁`-pair, every `γ` of the minimal palette is realized by a `∼`-class lying
strictly inside `(c',d')`. Since the classes strictly between `c` and `d` are Reynolds' `I`, this
says exactly that each `γ ∈ G` recurs in every subinterval of `I` cut out by a `≁`-pair — density
in `I`.

It is a corollary of `gammaBetween_eq_of_minimal` applied at `(c',d')` rather than at `(c,d)`,
which is why minimality has to be carried as a hypothesis about *all* `≁`-pairs and not merely
about the one pair `(c,d)`.

/-! ## Layer 6 — `M/∼` as a linear order, and the order type of Reynolds' `I`

Printed p.187:

> Since we have density of `M / ∼`, the classes in `I = {E | E is a ∼-class strictly between c and
> d}` have order type `ℚ`.

**Why a quotient type is constructed here when §6/§7 deliberately avoid one.** `Singletons.lean`'s
header states the §6/§7 convention outright: *"All four are stated below directly in terms of `∼`
itself, with no quotient type constructed"*, and for `QuotientDenselyOrdered` /
`HasDenseSingletons` that is right — each is a property of `∼` on `M`, expressible pointwise.
*"Order type `ℚ`"* is not of that kind. It is a statement about `I` **as an ordered set**: it
asserts an order isomorphism, so there must be a type carrying the order for the isomorphism to
land on. `Order.iso_of_countable_dense` cannot be applied to a pointwise predicate.

So this layer builds `M/∼` — and nothing above it needs to, which is why it lives here rather
than in `Singletons.lean`. The two §6/§7 predicates are used **unchanged** as the hypotheses of
the results below; `QuotientDenselyOrdered` is exactly what supplies `DenselyOrdered (M/∼)`, and
that is the whole reason it was stated pointwise in the first place.

**What the order needs, and what it does not.** The order on classes is well defined precisely
because classes are convex — clause (ii) of *"contemporaneous equivalence relation"*. Together
with clause (i) (`Equivalence`) that is all of it: `IsConvexEquiv` below bundles the two at a
**single** structure `M`, which is what `IsContempEquivDenseCD` yields at a countable dense flow.
Clause (iii) is not used, and neither is D1 — D1's role is upstream, in establishing
`QuotientDenselyOrdered` from Lemma 13, and that step is not this layer's.
-/

/-- The two clauses of *"contemporaneous equivalence relation"* the quotient order needs, taken at
one structure: `∼` is an equivalence and its classes are convex.

Bundling them at a single `M` (rather than quantifying over all structures, as
`IsContempEquivDense` and `IsContempEquivDenseCD` do) is what lets the quotient type below depend
on one proof term. `isConvexEquiv_of_contempEquivDenseCD` is the bridge from Reynolds' `ε`. -/

Cantor's isomorphism theorem (`Order.iso_of_countable_dense`) at the four properties established
above: countable (a quotient of a countable carrier, then a subtype), densely ordered, and without
end points — the last two both from `QuotientDenselyOrdered`, which is D2's antecedent and is what
D1 plus Lemma 13 supply upstream.

/-! ## Layer 7 — density of `M/∼` from D1

Printed p.187, the sentence between *"there are at least two `∼`-classes"* and the choice of
`a < b`:

> By lemma 13 and D1, we know that between any such classes is a third. Thus we have density of
> `M / ∼` and D2 says that we have density of singleton classes.

This is what turns D1 into the `QuotientDenselyOrdered` hypothesis Layer 6 runs on, and it is
also D2's antecedent — so the same lemma discharges the input of `doetsD2_epsDense`.
-/

/--
**Density of `M/∼`** — printed p.187, *"By lemma 13 and D1, we know that between any such classes
is a third. Thus we have density of `M / ∼`."*

The argument the printed sentence compresses: given `a ≁ b` with `a < b`, Lemma 13 gives `a`'s
class a **last** point `z` (it is bounded above, by `b`) and `b`'s class a **first** point `w`
(bounded below, by `a`). Convexity puts `z < w`, density of `M` produces a point strictly between
them, and that point is in neither class precisely because `z` is last and `w` is first.

Density of `M`'s own flow is used, and is one of Theorem 6's standing hypotheses. Without it the
`∼`-classes could be adjacent with nothing between them and the conclusion would be false, not
merely unproved.

/-! ## Layer 8 — Reynolds' three-summand decomposition of `M | (c,d)`

Printed p.188, the closing step of Theorem 6's proof:

> Let `c'` be the right hand end point of `c`'s `∼`-class and `d'` be the left hand end point of
> `d`'s. Thus
>
> `M | (c,d) = M | (c,c'] + M | ⋃I + M | [d',d)`.
>
> As `c ∼ c'`, there is `X ≡ₖ M | (c,c']` with flow isomorphic to an interval of `ℝ` and similarly
> there is `Y ≡ₖ M | [d',d)`. Then
>
> `M | (c,d) ≡ₖ X + 𝓡 + Y`
>
> and this latter has flow of time isomorphic to `ℝ` as required.

**The displayed three-summand identity is two nested binary splits, and both are already landed.**
`kEquiv_openSub_split` (`EpsilonDense.lean:858`) cuts an open interval at an interior point,
putting that point at the head of the second block, and `goodDense_binSum_pointSum`
(`EpsilonDense.lean:832`) is literally *"`X + M | {b} + Y` is good"* — the `R₁ + R₂ + R₃` step
Reynolds had already used once, for transitivity of `∼` (printed p.187), and where the seam
closes up because `X` inherits its lack of a right end point across `≡ₖ`.

Applying that pair twice, at `c'` and then at `d'`, *is* Reynolds' identity: the first cut splits
off `M | (c,c')` and leaves `M | [c',d)`; the second splits `M | [c',d)` — whose head is `c'`, so
that `M | {c'} + M | (c',d')` is Reynolds' `M | (c,c']` shifted one seam to the right — into
`M | (c',d')` and `M | [d',d)`. The middle block `M | (c',d')` is `⋃I`
(`unionClasses_eq_openSub` below).

So this layer adds no mathematics: it is the composition, stated once, with the goodness of the
middle block left as the hypothesis it is. `M | (c,c')` and `M | (d',d)` are very good outright,
because `c ∼ c'` and `d' ∼ d`; `hmid` is the only input that is not immediate, and supplying it is
the shuffle step.
-/

/--
**Reynolds' `M | (c,d) ≡ₖ X + 𝓡 + Y`** — printed p.188, as a statement about goodness.

Two applications of `goodDense_binSum_pointSum`, at `d'` and then at `c'`. The inner one produces
goodness of `M | (c',d)` from the middle block and the right-hand tail; the outer one prefixes
`M | (c,c')` and the seam point `c'`.

The hypotheses are exactly Reynolds' three summands: `hleft` is *"`c ∼ c'`"*, `hright` is
*"`d' ∼ d`"*, and `hmid` is *"`M | ⋃I` is good"* — the one that costs the shuffle.

**The decomposition with the degenerate cases admitted** — `c' = c` and `d' = d` are exactly the
cases in which `c`'s (resp. `d`'s) class is a singleton, and then Reynolds' `M | (c,c']` (resp.
`M | [d',d)`) is empty and the corresponding summand is absent.

Reynolds' *"Let `c'` be the right hand end point of `c`'s class"* passes over this silently. It is
not a corner case that can be assumed away: D2 supplies a **dense set of singleton classes**
(printed p.187), so singleton classes are the generic situation, and `c` or `d` landing on one is
routine rather than exceptional. All four combinations are discharged, the outer two by a single
split and the degenerate-degenerate one by the middle block alone.

/-! ## Layer 9 — Reynolds' `c'` and `d'`

Printed p.188: *"Let `c'` be the right hand end point of `c`'s `∼`-class and `d'` be the left hand
end point of `d`'s."*

That the two end points **exist** is Lemma 13 (`reynolds_lemma13_right` / `reynolds_lemma13_left`,
`Shuffle.lean:176,201`) together with D1: the classes do not end in gaps, so a class bounded on a
side attains its bound there. Reynolds' sentence reads as though the end points came for free;
they are exactly Lemma 13's content, which is the reason that lemma is proved at all.

What each construction adds beyond Lemma 13 is the **location** of the end point relative to the
opposite end of the interval — `c' < d` and `c < d'` — because that is what makes each a genuine
interior seam of `(c,d)`, and `c' < d'`, which is what makes the middle block non-degenerate. All
three are convexity plus transitivity of `∼` against `c ≁ d`, and all three fail without `c ≁ d`:
at `c ∼ d` the two classes coincide and there is no middle block at all. That is why Reynolds

/-! ## Layer 10 — `⋃I = (c',d')`

Reynolds writes the middle summand of his decomposition as `M | ⋃I`, with `I` the set of `∼`-classes
strictly between `c` and `d`, and the two outer summands as intervals cut at `c'` and `d'`. For the
decomposition and the shuffle to be about the *same* structure, `⋃I` has to be identified with the
open interval `(c',d')`, and the identification is where `c'` and `d'` earn their definitions:

* a point above `c'` is not `∼ c` and a point below `d'` is not `∼ d` — that is what *"end point of
  the class"* means, and it is the forward direction;
* a point of `(c,d)` that is `≁ c` and `≁ d` must lie above `c'` and below `d'` — convexity, and it
  is the backward direction.

`classStrictlyBetween_epsDense_iff` then lifts the pointwise identification to Reynolds' `I`
itself: a class lies strictly between `c` and `d` exactly when its points lie in `(c',d')`. That is
the form the shuffle step consumes, because the shuffle's block map is *"the `∼`-class of"* read on
`M | (c',d')` with `I` as its index.

**`⋃I = (c',d')`**, pointwise (printed p.188). The left side is membership in the middle block of

/-! ## Layer 11 — the two-sided closed normalization of Reynolds' `N_γ`

Printed p.187, the choice this layer makes good on:

> For each `γᵢ` choose a structure `N_i ⊨ γᵢ` whose flow of time is an interval of the reals.

and printed p.188, the sharper form the shuffle actually consumes:

> because the `γᵢ`'s say so, the summands themselves are closed intervals of the reals.

`goodDense` hands back *some* order-connected set of reals. The shuffle's summand hypotheses —
`hne`, `hdense`, `hsum`, `hbot`, `hsep` of `goodDense_shuffle` (Layer 3) — are the five facts that
hold of a **closed bounded** interval and fail for the open one: an open interval has no least
element and is not closed under suprema. So the normalization has to be sharpened, and the
sharpening is what *"the `γᵢ`'s say so"* means: `γ` records that the class has a right hand and a
left hand end point, which is Lemma 13 together with D1 (Layer 9), and *"has an end point"* is a
depth-`2` sentence, so it travels across `≡ₖ` at `k ≥ 2` exactly as *"has no end point"* does in
`noMaxOrder_of_kEquiv`.

The two ends then pin the flow down completely: an order-connected set of reals with a least and a
greatest element **is** the closed interval between them, with no residual choice. That is
`ordConnected_eq_Icc`, and `isIccLike_of_carrierSet_eq_Icc` reads the five facts off it.

`exists_ioo_witness` (`GoodDense.lean:713`) is the end-point-**free** case of this same
normalization and `icoBlock` / `kEquiv_pointSum_icoBlock` the one-sided case; neither applies here,
because Reynolds' summands are the ones that *do* have both ends.

separability is `exists_rat_btwn`.

/-! ## Layer 12 — the `∼`-classes are Reynolds' closed-interval summands

Printed p.188, the clause Layer 11 was built to consume:

> because the `γᵢ`'s say so the summands themselves are closed intervals of the reals

The summands are the `∼`-classes `E ∈ I`. This layer discharges the three facts Layer 11 needs of
each of them, and each fact is one of Reynolds' own sentences read at a class:

* **`M | E` is good.** `x ∼ y` *means* that `M | (x,y)` is very good (`SimDense`, printed p.185),
  and convexity of the class (Lemma 12) puts `(x,y)` inside `E` whenever `x, y ∈ E`. So every open
  subinterval of `M | E` is an `M | (x,y)` with `x ∼ y`, which makes `M | E` very good, and
  Lemma 11 turns that into goodness.
* **`M | E` has a right hand end point**, and **a left hand one.** This is Layer 9's construction
  run at `(e,d)` and at `(c,e)` rather than at `(c,d)`: the class of a point strictly inside
  `(c,d)` is bounded on both sides — above by `d`, below by `c` — so Lemma 13 and D1 attain both
  bounds *inside the class*. Reynolds uses the same two end points at the outer classes of `c` and
  of `d`; at the interior classes they are what makes each summand closed.

The two `≡ₖ`-identifications at the head of the section are the bookkeeping that lets a class be
cut out of `M` or out of `M | (c',d')` interchangeably — `restrictSet` composed with
`openSubinterval` in each order. Reynolds writes `M | E` throughout and never distinguishes the
two; in Lean they are different types and the shuffle's block map consumes the second.

**A `∼`-class is very good** — printed p.185's `∼` unwound at the class.

`x ∼ y` *is* very-goodness of `M | (x,y)`, and convexity puts `(x,y)` inside the class, so
`kEquiv_restrictSet_openSub` identifies each open subinterval of `M | E` with such an `M | (x,y)`.
Lemma 11 then supplies the goodness clause and density of `M` the non-emptiness clause.

/-! ## Layer 13 — Reynolds' `σ`, and the family `{N_γ | γ ∈ G}`

Printed p.187, the two choices this layer makes:

> Any structure is a model of just one such `γ`. … we can choose `σ : ℚ → {N_γ | γ ∈ G}`
> appropriately.

*"a model of just one such `γ`"* is `nf_exists_unique`, so *"the `γ` realized by the class at that
rational"* is a **function**, not a choice: `classNF` reads it off a point, `classColour` is the
same function on `M/∼` — well defined because `∼`-equivalent points have literally the same class
structure — and `σ` is `classColour ∘ e.symm` for the order isomorphism `e : I ≃o ℚ` of Layer 6.
Nothing here is chosen; Reynolds' *"appropriately"* is discharged by `e` alone.

`{N_γ | γ ∈ G}` is the one place a choice remains, and `exists_iccLike_family` makes it once. The
three clauses of its conclusion are the three uses the shuffle puts the family to: `IsIccLike` at
**every** index (`goodDense_shuffle` quantifies its five summand hypotheses over all of `ι`, not
just over `S`), *"`N_γ ⊨ γ`"* at the indices `σ` can reach, and *"`γ₁` is only satisfied by one
point structures"* at `γ₁`.

`isShuffleMap_classColour` is *"by minimality of `G`, all the `γᵢ`'s in `G` are satisfied densely in
`I`"* (printed p.187) transported along `e`. It is Layer 5's `gammaBetween_dense_of_minimal` plus
one bridge Reynolds passes over: a `γ` recurring in *some* subinterval of `(c,d)` has to be shown
to recur in the subinterval **the two rationals name**. The bridge is Layer 9's two end points run
at the two classes `e.symm r` and `e.symm s`, which is why the class end points are needed twice —
once to close each summand (Layer 12) and once to locate it.

> Also, by minimality of `G`, all the `γᵢ`'s in `G` are satisfied densely in `I`. … we can choose
> `σ : ℚ → {N_γ | γ ∈ G}` appropriately.

Two clauses. That `σ` lands in `G` is `classNF_mem_gammaBetween` at each class of `I`. That it takes
every value of `G` inside every rational interval is Layer 5's `gammaBetween_dense_of_minimal`
plus the bridge Reynolds' *"densely in `I`"* leaves implicit: minimality produces a class realizing
`γ` inside a `≁`-pair of `M`-points, and the `≁`-pair has to be **the one the two rationals name**.
Layer 9's two end points supply it — the right hand end point `x'` of the class `e.symm r` and the
left hand end point `y'` of the class `e.symm s` — because a class strictly inside `(x',y')` is
inequivalent to both named classes and lies between them, which is exactly *"strictly between them
in `I`"* and hence, along `e`, *"at a rational strictly between `r` and `s`"*.

/-! ## Layer 14 — the shuffle step

Layers 8-10 discharge Reynolds' closing paragraph except for the goodness of the middle block
`M | ⋃I`, which is the shuffle; Layers 11-13 supply its three ingredients. This layer composes
them, and `goodDense_unionClasses` is Reynolds' shuffle sentence with nothing left over:

* `hmin` is the minimality of `G`, feeding `isShuffleMap_classColour` (Layer 13);
* `D1` gives `I ≃o ℚ` through `nonempty_orderIso_rat_classBetween_epsDense` (Layers 6-7) — *"the
  classes in `I` have order type `ℚ`"*;
* `D2` gives the dense set of singleton classes, which is `γ₁` — Reynolds' one-point colour;
* `hI` is `⋃I = (c',d')` (Layer 10), so the block map on `M | (c',d')` is indexed by `I`.

The composition is `kEquiv_blocks_shuffle` (Reynolds' `M | (⋃ I) = Σ_{E ∈ I} M | E ≡ₖ
Σ_{q ∈ ℚ} σ(q)`) followed by `goodDense_shuffle` (his `Σ_{q ∈ ℚ} σ(q) ≡ₖ Σ_{r ∈ ℝ} σ*(r)` and
*"`R` is isomorphic to the reals"*). The only step of the composition Reynolds does not write is
`kEquiv_classBlock`: his `M | E` is the class cut from `M`, while the block map cuts it from
`M | (c',d')`, and in Lean those are different types.

is all `γ₁` needs to be: its class structure is a one-point structure, so `γ₁` is the normal form

**A block of `M | (c',d')` is a class of `M`** — the one step of Reynolds' composition he does not
write, because on paper `M | E` is one object.

The block `{v ∈ (c',d') | v's class is E}` and the class `E` cut straight out of `M` have the same
points, since `E ⊆ (c',d')` by `hI`; `kEquiv_openSub_restrictSet` (Layer 12) is the identification,
and `kEquiv_of_shared_nf` then replaces the class by the family's representative of its colour —
Reynolds' *"for any `E ∈ I`, `M | E ≡ₖ N_γ` for one of the `γ`'s in `G`"*.

**`M | ⋃I` is good** — Reynolds 1992, §8, printed pp.187-188, the shuffle step:

> Since we have density of `M / ∼`, the classes in `I` have order type `ℚ`. Also, by minimality of
> `G`, all the `γᵢ`'s in `G` are satisfied densely in `I`. … `M | (⋃ I) = Σ_{E ∈ I} M | E ≡ₖ
> Σ_{q ∈ ℚ} σ(q)` … `Σ_{q ∈ ℚ} σ(q) ≡ₖ Σ_{r ∈ ℝ} σ*(r)` … `R` is isomorphic to the reals.

The proof is that paragraph, in order: `e : I ≃o ℚ` is the first sentence (Layers 6-7), `γ₁` and its
one-point structure come from D2 (Layer 14), the family `{N_γ}` from Layers 11-12, the block
identification `M | (⋃ I) = Σ_{E ∈ I} M | E ≡ₖ Σ_{q ∈ ℚ} σ(q)` from `kEquiv_blocks_shuffle` over
`kEquiv_classBlock`, and the passage to `ℝ` from `goodDense_shuffle`.

**Reynolds' §8 Theorem 6 contradiction** — printed pp.187-188, assembled.

> We are going to show that `M | (a,b)` is very good thus producing a contradiction.
>
> So suppose that `a < c < d < b`. We need only show that `M | (c,d)` is good. If `c ∼ d` then this
> follows from lemma 11. So suppose not.

The proof below is exactly that: `exists_minimal_gammaBetween` makes Reynolds' choice (Layer 5),
very-goodness of `M | (a,b)` is `SimDense` at `a,b` and so contradicts `a ≁ b` outright,
`veryGoodDense_openSubinterval_iff` reduces it to goodness of each `M | (c,d)`, the `c ∼ d` branch
is Lemma 11, and the `c ≁ d` branch is Layers 8-10 over `goodDense_unionClasses`.

Sorry-free, and axiom-clean: `#print axioms` reports exactly `propext`, `Classical.choice` and
`Quot.sound`. `goodDense_unionClasses`, which used to carry the shuffle step as a tracked residual,
is itself sorry-free since Layers 11-14 landed.

**Doets' Theorem** — Reynolds 1992, §8 Theorem 6, printed pp.185-188; Doets 1987, 3.3.9.

> *Suppose that `M` is a temporal structure in a finite language whose flow of time is countable,
> dense and without end points. Suppose further that for any contemporaneous equivalence relation
> `∼` on `M`, D1) the `∼` classes do not end in gaps and D2) if `M/∼` is densely ordered then
> `M/∼` has a dense set of singletons. Then for all `k < ω`, there is a temporal structure with
> flow of time the real numbers satisfying the same monadic first order sentences of quantifier
> depth at most `k` as `M` does.*

Reynolds' own note on the attribution (printed p.185): *"This statement is slightly stronger than
Doets' and the proof is a little different because of the contemporaneity notion."*

`hk : 2 ≤ k` is not in the printed statement and is not a strengthening of it: at `k ≤ 1` the
end-point sentences `hasMaxSent`/`hasMinSent` exceed the quantifier depth budget, so *"without
end points"* does not travel across `≡ₖ` and Reynolds' *"flow of time the real numbers"* is not
determined. Every §8 result in this tree carries the same hypothesis.
