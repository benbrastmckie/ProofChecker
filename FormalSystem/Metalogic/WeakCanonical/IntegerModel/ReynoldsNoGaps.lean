# Archimedean One-Class Theorem and Gap Existence

This file provides key theorems for the Reynolds completeness pipeline:

1. `very_good_of_archimedean`: In an archimedean discrete linear order, every
   structure is very good (subintervals are finite, hence good).

2. `one_class_archimedean`: In any discrete archimedean linear order with
   successor/predecessor, all points are contemporaneously equivalent.
   This does NOT require Prior-UZ/SZ -- the archimedean property suffices.

3. `gap_of_not_succ_archimedean`: If NOT IsSuccArchimedean, there exists a Gap
   (Dedekind cut with no maximum and no minimum in complement).

## Mathematical Content

In an `IsSuccArchimedean` discrete linear order:
- Every closed interval [a,b] is finite (by `subinterval_finite_of_succ_archimedean`)
- Every finite structure is good (by `finite_structures_good`)
- Therefore every subinterval is good, hence every structure is very good
- Therefore all points are contemporaneously equivalent

/-! ## Archimedean Very-Good Theorem

In an archimedean discrete linear order, every structure is very good.

/--
In a successor-archimedean discrete linear order, every subinterval is finite,
hence good. Therefore every structure is very good.

**Archimedean One-Class Theorem**: In any discrete archimedean linear order
without endpoints, all points are contemporaneously equivalent.

This is a consequence of the fact that in archimedean orders, all subintervals
are finite, hence good, hence every structure is very good.

No Prior-UZ/SZ hypotheses are needed -- the archimedean property alone suffices.

/-! ## Gap Existence from Non-Archimedean

If a discrete linear order without endpoints is NOT IsSuccArchimedean,
then there exists a Dedekind gap (a `Gap` in the EF game framework sense).

The gap is constructed from the successor orbit of a point that cannot
reach some larger point: cut = {x : ∃ n, x ≤ succ^[n] a}.

/--
**Gap Existence**: If a discrete linear order without endpoints is NOT
IsSuccArchimedean, then there exists a Dedekind Gap.

The gap is constructed as follows: given a, b with succ^[n](a) ≠ b for all n
(witnessed by ¬IsSuccArchimedean), define

  cut = {x : ∃ n, x ≤ succ^[n] a}

This set is nonempty (contains a), proper (excludes b), downward-closed,
has no supremum in the cut (successor closure), and its complement has no
minimum (pred of any complement point is in the cut, and succ(pred) = that
point, giving contradiction).
