# Reynolds §6 Lemma 5: formula and elementary transfer across classes

Reynolds 1992, *An Axiomatization for Until and Since over the Reals without the IRR Rule*,
§6 *"No gaps between equivalence classes"*, printed **p.179**.

This module continues `Lemma34.lean` (Lemmas 3 and 4) with Lemma 5, both of its statements.

## The source, verbatim

Printed p.179, **Lemma 5**:

> **LEMMA 5** *If a temporal formula holds somewhere in one `∼`-class in a maximal interval of
> `R`, then it holds somewhere in each `∼`-class in the interval.*
>
> *Furthermore, each pair of the `∼`-classes in a maximal interval of `R` are elementarily
> equivalent (taken as substructures of `M`).*
>
> **PROOF.** For a contradiction to the first statement, suppose that `A` holds in one class but
> not anywhere in some other class in the same maximal interval of `R`.
>
> Using expressive completeness and `ε`, find `B` which is true at points only if `A` occurs
> somewhere in their `∼`-class. By using `¬B` instead if necessary we may suppose that we have `B`
> holding throughout one `∼`-class in our maximal interval of `R` and false throughout a later
> class. Choose a point `t` in this former class in which `B` holds. `B` holds in the whole of a
> class if it is true anywhere at all in the class so it continues for a while after `t`. By
> Prior-U there is either a last point where `B` holds after `t` (not possible as `B` must continue
> for a while) or a first point `s > t` where `¬B ∧ K⁻(B)` holds.
>
> So `s` must be the left hand end point of its `∼`-class. Look at the gap at right hand end of
> this class. We can not have `B` arbitrarily soon after the gap because of Prior-U. Thus for a
> while after this class `B` stays false.
>
> Let `C` be the temporal formula saying that we are now in a class whose left hand end point is
> also in the class and at that point `K⁻(B)` holds. Now `C` is true in `s`'s class but false
> afterwards contradicting Prior-U.
>
> Now consider the second statement in the lemma. Given a monadic sentence `φ`, we relativise it by
> restricting quantifiers to where `ε(x, −)` holds. We get a formula `φ(x)` of one free variable.
> By expressive completeness this is equivalent to a temporal formula. This is true exactly
> throughout `∼`-classes which model `φ`. Then, by the first part of the lemma, it can't be true
> somewhere and false elsewhere in the interval. ∎

The block above was read off the page image
(`Reynolds_1992_Axiomatization_Until_Since_without_IRR.pdf`, PDF page index 15 = printed p.179)
and not off the pre-segmented corpus chunk. See the corpus notes below.

## Corpus and plan notes

**Page reference.** Plan v8's Phase 19 says *"printed p.178"*. Lemma 5's statement **and** its
whole proof are on printed p.179; p.180 opens with Lemma 6. This continues the page-reference
drift recorded under Phase 18 (Lemmas 3-4 at pp.178-179, not p.177), and the docstrings below use
the pages the lemma is actually printed on.

**Corpus fidelity.** Unlike Lemmas 3 and 4, Lemma 5 contains **no displayed formula**, which is
where both previously-found §6 corpus defects sat (`ρ`'s missing middle conjunct, recorded under
Phase 17; Lemma 4's mangled display, recorded under Phase 18). Its inline text in
`~/Projects/Literature/sources/reynolds_1992/sec03_6-no-gaps-between-equivalence-classes.md`
checks out against the page image with one cosmetic difference: the corpus renders *"We get a
formula `φ'` of one free variable"* where the page prints *"We get a formula `φ(x)` of one free
variable"*. Plan v8 repeats the corpus' `φ'`. Nothing turns on it — both name the same
one-free-variable relativization — but the quotation above uses the printed form.

## What this module lands, and in what order

Reynolds' proof needs three things this tree did not have.

1. **A monadic image of a temporal formula.** *"Using expressive completeness and `ε`, find `B`
   which is true at points only if `A` occurs somewhere in their `∼`-class"* builds `B` from `A`'s
   **monadic** form. The tree lands the hard direction of §5 Theorem 3
   (`uSExpressivelyCompleteOverDensePrior`, monadic → temporal) but not the easy converse. It is
   landed here as `temporalAt` / `temporalToMonadic`, with the checked soundness theorem
   `eval_temporalAt`. The recursion is available only because `TemporalTruth`
   (`Table.lean:188`) reads `.box φ` off `M.interp (atomMap (.box φ))` — a monadic atom — so every
   clause of `TemporalTruth` is monadically expressible after all.

2. **Two reusable auxiliary-formula families**, in Phase 18's style (named monadic definition,
   named semantic reading, checked `..._eval`): `classBeginsWithFormula` (*"we are now in a class
   whose left hand end point is also in the class and at that point … holds"*) and `kMinusFormula`
   (`K⁻`, *"… accumulates from below"*). Reynolds' `C` is their composite,
   `classLeftEndKMinusTemporal`. `Lemma34.lean`'s `classBeginsAtGapStartFormula` is the same shape
   with `R ∧ K⁻(¬R)` in the payload slot; it is **not** refactored to go through these — nothing is
   removed or renamed — and the relationship is recorded at `classBeginsWithFormula`'s docstring.

3. **A bounded gap-crossing.** Phase 18's `false_of_holds_throughout_class` (`Lemma34.lean:595`)
   asks for the auxiliary formula to fail at **every** point outside the class with `R` throughout
   in between. Lemma 5's `C` does not satisfy that, and cannot: with classes `C₀ ⊨ ¬B`, `C₁ ⊨ B`,
   `C₂ ⊨ ¬B` in a row, `C₂`'s left end point does carry `K⁻(B)`, so `C` is true again at `C₂`.
   Reynolds says only *"false **afterwards**"*, and gets that from the preceding paragraph
   (*"for a while after this class `B` stays false"*). `false_of_holds_throughout_class_bounded`
   below is that reading: failure is required only below an explicit bound `b`. It is a genuine
   strengthening rather than a duplicate — the unbounded form does not imply it — and Phase 18's
   theorem is left in place and unweakened.

## Honest caveat, carried forward

Every §6 lemma below Lemma 2 remains **conditional**: `IsContempEquivDense ε` plus Reynolds'
Prior-U / Prior-S on `M` are hypotheses, and the only `ε` this tree can currently exhibit
satisfying them is the total relation `epsTop` (`Defs.lean:461`), for which `EndsInGapOnRight`
is empty (`not_endsInGapOnRight_epsTop`). So the results below are not discharged at any
non-trivial instance; the first live instance is due at the Lemma 9 / dense-surgery stage.

`IsContempEquivDenseOn` and `IsDualClosed` (`Defs.lean`, `Dual.lean`). `IsDualClosed` is carried at
file scope rather than per-declaration because the mirror halves of Lemmas 5-9 obtain their results

/-! ## A monadic image of a temporal formula

Reynolds uses expressive completeness in both directions in §6 without comment. The tree lands
only the hard direction. This section lands the easy one.

`temporalAt atomMap i A` is the monadic formula, at any arity, saying *"`A` holds at the point
named by De Bruijn index `i`"*. The `U` and `S` clauses are Reynolds' own truth conditions,
transcribed from `TemporalTruth` (`Table.lean:188`) one binder at a time; `.box φ` and `.atom a`
are monadic atoms, because `TemporalTruth` already reads both off `M.interp`. -/

/-- **`A` at De Bruijn index `i`**, as a monadic formula.

Index discipline: under `∃s` the former `i` is `i.succ` and `0` is `s`; under a further `∀r` the

`rhoAt` (`Lemma34.lean:352`) is this operation specialized to `ρ`. `atVar` is the same

Phase 18 landed changes shape. -/

/-! ## The bounded gap-crossing

Phase 18's `false_of_holds_throughout_class` (`Lemma34.lean:595`) isolates Reynolds' recurring
*"holds up to a gap and is false arbitrarily soon after the gap, contradicting Prior-U"* step, and
requires the auxiliary formula to fail at **every** point outside the class reachable with `R`
throughout. Reynolds' Lemma 5 supplies less: only *"false afterwards"*, on the stretch on which
the preceding paragraph has already shown `B` to stay false.

This is that weaker hypothesis. The proof is Phase 18's, with the explicit bound `b` doing the
work its `exists_gt_notContemp_holds` call did: `ρ(s)`'s third conjunct — *"there is no first point
after the class"* — already guarantees a point of `(s,b)` outside the class as soon as `b` itself
is outside it, so no appeal to Lemma 3 is needed and Prior-S drops out of the hypotheses. -/

/-- **The gap-crossing contradiction, bounded.**

`P` holds throughout `s`'s class, and fails at every point of `(s,b)` outside that class, where
`b` is itself outside the class. Prior-U forbids this.

This does **not** follow from `false_of_holds_throughout_class`, whose `hout` is strictly
stronger; both are kept. -/

*"Look at the gap at right hand end of this class. We can not have `B` arbitrarily soon after the
gap because of Prior-U. Thus for a while after this class `B` stays false."* (printed p.179)

Reynolds' *"we can not have `B` arbitrarily soon after the gap"* is Prior-U applied to `¬B` at
`s`: `¬B` already holds on an initial stretch above `s` (it holds throughout `s`'s class, and the
class has no last point), so the boundary point Prior-U returns must lie at or beyond the gap —
inside the class it would have to be a point where `¬B` fails, or one after which `B` accumulates,
and both are excluded by class-invariance. -/

The whole of Reynolds' first proof paragraph, run on an arbitrary **class-invariant** temporal
formula. That is exactly what *"by using `¬B` instead if necessary"* needs: `B` and `¬B` are both
class-invariant, and the contradiction is symmetric in them. -/

A class-invariant temporal formula cannot be true at one point and false at a later one with `R`
holding throughout in between. *"In the same maximal interval of `R`"* is rendered as `R`
throughout the closed segment `[t,t']`, which is what being in one maximal — hence convex —
`R`-interval amounts to for two of its points.

Reynolds' *"`¬B ∧ K⁻(B)`"* is `hnBs` together with `hkm` below; the tree's Prior-U
(`PriorDefsDense.lean:119`) returns the `¬B` half directly and the `K⁻` half is read off the
stretch it also returns, using `ρ` to supply the intermediate points. -/

/-! ## Lemma 5, second statement: relativization to a `∼`-class

*"Given a monadic sentence `φ`, we relativise it by restricting quantifiers to where `ε(x, −)`
holds. We get a formula `φ(x)` of one free variable. By expressive completeness this is equivalent
to a temporal formula. This is true exactly throughout `∼`-classes which model `φ`. Then, by the
first part of the lemma, it can't be true somewhere and false elsewhere in the interval."*
(printed p.179)

**Rendering of "taken as substructures of `M`".** A `∼`-class is convex but need not be an
interval with end points in `M` — Lemma 3 is precisely the statement that maximal `R`-intervals
have *excluded* end points, and by `ρ` the classes inside them end in gaps. So `M.subinterval`
(`MonadicFO.lean:215`), which needs two carrier points, cannot name a class. The induced
substructure is therefore named the standard equivalent way, by **relativized satisfaction**:
`evalOn M S` is `eval` with every quantifier restricted to `S`, and *"the class of `t` models
`φ`"* is `evalOn` at `S = ContempEquivDense M ε t`. Reynolds' relativization step is then exactly
the syntactic counterpart, `relativizeToClass`, and `eval_relativizeAt` is the theorem that the
two agree. -/

/-- **Satisfaction relativized to a subset `S` of the carrier** — `eval` (`MonadicFO.lean:306`)
with both quantifiers restricted to `S`. This is the induced substructure's satisfaction relation,
named without having to build the substructure. -/

One fresh free variable is appended at index `Fin.last n`: that is Reynolds' `x`, the point whose
class the quantifiers are restricted to. Every pre-existing free variable keeps its index, via
`Fin.castSucc`.

Landed at arbitrary arity, not only for sentences, because the induction that verifies it has to
pass through subformulas with free variables — and because Lemma 12 needs the same operator
applied to a two-variable `γ(z,t)`. -/

/-! ## Lemma 5 over maximal intervals of `λ`

Reynolds states Lemma 5 over maximal intervals of `R` only, and prints no dual. The `λ`-side
statement below is therefore **unstated by Reynolds**: it is licensed by the duality convention
he sets at printed **p.178** — *"Dually we can define `λ(x)` about left ends."* — and it is
required by the appeal to *"previous results"* in Lemma 6's closing sentence at printed **p.180**
(*"using mirror images of the above and previous results we get our proof"*). It is not
attributed to the source as a printed statement, because it is not one.

It is obtained by **instantiation**, not by a second proof: `reynolds_lemma5_first` at
`(dual M, dualize ε)`, rewritten through `Dual.lean`'s transport lemmas. That is what makes it
a formalization of Reynolds' sentence rather than of a proof he did not write.

The standing §6 caveat applies unchanged: this result, like everything in §6 below Lemma 2, is
**conditional** on `IsContempEquivDense ε` together with Prior-U/Prior-S, and has no live
non-trivial instance yet. -/

/-- **Reynolds 1992, §6 Lemma 5, printed p.179 — the first statement over maximal intervals of
`λ` rather than of `R`.**

> *If a temporal formula holds somewhere in one `∼`-class in a maximal interval of `R`, then it
> holds somewhere in each `∼`-class in the interval.*

with `R` replaced by `L` throughout. **Reynolds prints no such statement**; see the section
header for what licenses it and for why it is not attributed to him.

Proved by instantiating `reynolds_lemma5_first` at `(dual M, dualize ε)` and at `swapUS A`. -/
