# Reynolds §7 Theorem 5: a dense set of singleton classes, from axiom Sep

Reynolds 1992, *An Axiomatization for Until and Since over the Reals without the IRR Rule*,
§7 *"Separability"*, printed **p.184**.

This module lands **D2**, the second hypothesis of Doets' theorem: a Prior structure satisfying
every substitution instance of axiom Sep has, for every contemporaneous equivalence relation
whose quotient is densely ordered, a *dense set of singleton classes*.

## The source, verbatim

Printed p.184, **Theorem 5** — statement and whole proof:

> **THEOREM 5** *Suppose that `M` is a Prior structure which also satisfies every substitution
> instance of axiom Sep.*
>
> *Then for every contemporaneous equivalence relation `∼` such that `M/∼` is densely ordered,
> `M/∼` has a dense set of singletons.*
>
> **PROOF.** From the preceding theorem 4 we know that the `∼`-classes do not end at gaps. In
> fact the classes must be closed intervals: if a class has an excluded end point then this point
> is in the next class and this contradicts density.
>
> Suppose that `c < d` in `M` such that `c ≁ d`. We must show that there is a singleton class
> between the classes of `c` and `d`. Without loss of generality, `c` is the right hand end point
> of its class.
>
> Let the temporal formula `C` be true exactly at points who are the left hand end points of their
> classes. This includes the case of a singleton class. We use expressive completeness here.
>
> Now `C ∧ U(C, ¬C)` never holds in `M`, so it certainly does not hold soon after `c`, and so
> `¬K⁺(C ∧ U(C, ¬C))` holds at `c`.
>
> Also `K⁺(C)` holds at `c` so we can use axiom Sep to deduce that `K⁺(K⁺C ∧ K⁻C)` holds at `c`.
>
> Certainly `K⁺C ∧ K⁻C` must hold at some `e` between `c` and `d` but clearly `e` must be in a
> class of its own. ∎

The block above was read off the page image
(`Reynolds_1992_Axiomatization_Until_Since_without_IRR.pdf`, PDF page index 19 = printed p.184)
and not off the pre-segmented corpus chunk.

## Corpus and page-measurement notes

**Page reference, corrected.** Plan v10's Phase 23 says *"printed pp.184-185"*. Measured off the
200 dpi page images: §7 *Separability* **opens** on printed p.183, directly under Theorem 4's
statement, and Lemma 10 with its whole proof is on p.183. **Theorem 5's statement and its entire
proof fit on printed p.184 alone**, and §8 *Doets' Theorem* also opens on p.184; p.185 is already
inside §8's preliminaries. So the citation for everything in this module is `p.184`, singular.

The offset measured for §6 (`printed page = PDF 1-based page + 164`) **does** carry over to §7 —
verified page by page across PDF indices 18, 19 and 20 — but the plan's *content* attribution did
not, which is why the offset was re-measured rather than assumed.

**Corpus reliability.** §6's chunk had two recorded display defects (see `Lemma34.lean`'s
*"Lemma 4 at the boundary"*). The §7 chunk (`sec04_7-separability.md`) was compared
sentence-by-sentence against the p.183 and p.184 images and is **clean**: Theorem 5's statement
and all five proof paragraphs match the printed page. §7 carries no displayed formulas in
Theorem 5 at all — everything is inline — which is consistent with §6's finding that the corpus's
inline prose is reliable where its displays are not. **No source defect is claimed or repaired by
this module.**

## Proof step to declaration map

| Reynolds' step (printed p.184) | Declaration |
|---|---|
| *"the classes do not end at gaps"* | `no_gaps_dense_prior` / `no_gaps_dense_prior_left` (Phase 22, 22.1) |
| *"the classes must be closed intervals"*, right end | `exists_rightEndPoint` |
| *"…"*, left end | `exists_leftEndPoint` (by order duality, not a hand mirror) |
| *"Without loss of generality, `c` is the right hand end point of its class"* | `exists_rightEndPoint`, applied to `c` inside `reynolds_theorem5` |
| *"Let the temporal formula `C` be true exactly at … left hand end points"* | `leftEndFormula`, `classLeftEndFormula`, `classLeftEndFormula_spec` |
| *"We use expressive completeness here"* | `uSExpressivelyCompleteOverDensePrior` (§5 Theorem 3), consumed in `classLeftEndFormula` |
| *"`C ∧ U(C,¬C)` never holds in `M`"* | `not_leftEnd_and_untl` |
| *"…so `¬K⁺(C ∧ U(C,¬C))` holds at `c`"* | `not_kplusOpen_of_never` |
| *"Also `K⁺(C)` holds at `c`"* | `kplusOpen_classLeftEnd` |
| *"we can use axiom Sep to deduce that `K⁺(K⁺C ∧ K⁻C)` holds at `c`"* | the `h_sep` hypothesis of `reynolds_theorem5` |
| *"`K⁺C ∧ K⁻C` must hold at some `e` between `c` and `d`"* | `reynolds_theorem5`, the final `h_sep … d hc'd` |
| *"but clearly `e` must be in a class of its own"* | `isSingletonClass_of_kplus_kminus` |

*"We use expressive completeness here"* is the sentence Block D exists for. It is consumed at
exactly one place — `classLeftEndFormula` — and nowhere else in this module.

## Where Sep comes from, and where it does not

Reynolds' §7 has two halves. **Lemma 10** (Sep's validity over real flows, printed p.183) is
**not re-derived here**: `sep_valid` (`Soundness.lean:1601`) is landed and already stated at
`ValidRTime`. This module consumes `Axiom.sep`'s *derivability* side — the semantic
reading of the axiom scheme at a structure — exactly as Phase 16 does for Prior-U and Prior-S.

`Axiom.sep` (`ProofSystem/Axioms.lean:420`) is stated with `Formula.kPlus` / `Formula.kMinus`.
It is read here through **Phase 10.1's bridge**, cited by name: `Kamp.kPlus_formula_correct` and
`Kamp.kMinus_formula_correct` (`Kamp/KPlusFaithful.lean:150`, `:170`), which identify
`Formula.kPlus` / `Formula.kMinus` with `Kamp.kplusOpen` / `Kamp.kminusOpen` — the faithful
`Prop`-level readings, **not** this tree's stronger `kplus` / `kminus`, which carry an extra
conjunct that is in neither Reynolds nor Rabinovich.

## `SemanticSepOpen` and the layering it preserves

`SemanticSep` (`BXCanonical/Chronicle/ChronicleMonadicBridge.lean:863`) is the same statement as
`SemanticSepOpen` below, character for character in its body. It is **restated** here rather than
imported for the reason `ChronicleInstance.lean` records: `ChronicleMonadicBridge`'s transitive
closure is roughly 280 modules, and `DenseModelSurgery/` is a low-level parametric §6/§7 layer
that must not depend on it. Nothing is removed or renamed; `SemanticSep` stands untouched.

That the two are *definitionally the same* is not asserted — it is machine-checked, at the one
place the two layers meet: `ChronicleInstance.lean` passes `hpack.sep`, a `SemanticSep`, directly
into a `SemanticSepOpen` argument. That application elaborates only if the two are defeq.

## Honest caveat, carried forward

Every §6 lemma below Lemma 2 remains **conditional**: `IsContempEquivDense ε` plus Reynolds'
Prior-U / Prior-S on `M` are hypotheses, and the only `ε` this tree can currently exhibit
satisfying them is the total relation `epsTop` (`Defs.lean:461`), for which `EndsInGapOnRight`
is empty (`not_endsInGapOnRight_epsTop`). So the results below are not discharged at any
non-trivial instance; the first live instance is due at the Lemma 9 / dense-surgery stage.

**This module inherits that caveat unchanged and adds nothing to its discharge.** Theorem 5
consumes Theorem 4, so it is conditional on everything Theorem 4 is conditional on, plus Sep and
plus the density of `M/∼`. Phase 22.1 retired the *third* condition (`HasBadIntervalSurgery`) and
the *structure* half at one named structure; the `ε` half stands until Reynolds' §8 Lemma 12
lands. `EndsInGapOnRight` being empty at `epsTop` makes an instantiation there vacuous, and
`QuotientDenselyOrdered M (epsTop sig)` is itself unsatisfiable whenever `M` has two points — so
the `epsTop` instantiation of Theorem 5 is vacuous for a *second*, independent reason, recorded
below as `quotientDenselyOrdered_epsTop_vacuous` rather than left to be rediscovered. **No §6 or
§7 result is described as discharged by this module.** See `NoGaps.lean`'s
`## Conditionality after Theorem 4` for the full three-condition accounting.

set of singletons*. All four are stated below directly in terms of `∼` itself, with no quotient

property of `∼` on `M`. -/

> *"if a class has an excluded end point then this point is in the next class and this contradicts

Reynolds' one-sentence argument, executed. `EndsInGapOnRight`'s three conjuncts are exactly
*"the class is bounded above"*, *"the class has no last point"* and *"there is no first point
above the class"*. Theorem 4 refutes their conjunction. So a class that is bounded above and has
no last point must have a *first point above it* — Reynolds' *"excluded end point"* — and that
point's class is the next class, with nothing between. Density forbids that.

The conclusion is therefore the existence of a genuine end point, which is what *"closed
interval"* means here. -/

left hand end point lies strictly between `x` and `y`. Contradiction.

Given any `s > c`: since `c` is the right hand end point of its class, `c ≁ s`, so density
supplies a class strictly between, and (classes being closed intervals) that class's left hand end
point lies strictly between `c` and `s`. So `C` holds arbitrarily soon after `c`. -/

If some `y ≠ e` were contemporaneous with `e`, then the whole closed interval between them lies
in `e`'s class; but `K⁺C` (resp. `K⁻C`) puts a left hand end point strictly inside that interval,

> instance of axiom Sep. Then for every contemporaneous equivalence relation `∼` such that `M/∼`
> is densely ordered, `M/∼` has a dense set of singletons.* (printed p.184)

Reynolds' five proof paragraphs, in order. Theorem 4 is consumed at the top — both ends — and is
not re-proved; the *"without loss of generality"* is discharged rather than assumed, by moving `c`
to the right hand end point of its own class via `exists_rightEndPoint`. -/

This is **D2**, the second hypothesis of Doets' theorem (Reynolds §8 Theorem 6, printed p.184).

`no_gaps_dense_prior` and `no_gaps_dense_prior_left` (Theorem 4, D1) are consumed inside, so
Theorem 4 is *not* an extra hypothesis: the Prior pair that Theorem 4 needs is already here.

**Still conditional**, and on exactly what Theorem 4 is conditional on plus Sep and density:
`IsContempEquivDense ε` remains a hypothesis, and no non-trivial `ε` is available in this tree.

/-! ## Anti-vacuity, stated honestly

The `epsTop` instantiation is vacuous **twice over**, and both reasons are recorded here rather
than left to be rediscovered:

1. `EndsInGapOnRight` is empty at `epsTop` (`not_endsInGapOnRight_epsTop`), which is the standing
   §6 reason;
2. `QuotientDenselyOrdered M (epsTop sig)` is itself *unsatisfiable* whenever `M` has two
   distinct points, since `epsTop`'s single class is the whole structure and the definition's
   `¬ ContempEquivDense` antecedent can never be met.

So Theorem 5 at `epsTop` has an unsatisfiable hypothesis, not merely a trivial conclusion. A live
non-trivial `ε` is Reynolds' §8 Lemma 12 and is not in this tree. -/

/-- **`QuotientDenselyOrdered` is unsatisfiable at `epsTop`** on any structure with two distinct
points: the hypothesis `¬ ContempEquivDense M (epsTop sig) a b` is never met.

Recorded so that no reader mistakes an `epsTop` instantiation of Theorem 5 for a non-trivial
instance of §7. -/
