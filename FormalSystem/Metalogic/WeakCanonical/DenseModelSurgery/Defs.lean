# Reynolds §6 vocabulary: contemporaneous equivalence, `ρ`, `λ`, and Lemma 2

Reynolds 1992, *An Axiomatization for Until and Since over the Reals without the IRR Rule*,
§6 *"No gaps between equivalence classes"*, printed pp.176-177.

This module lands the §6 vocabulary at the **dense** instance and discharges **Lemma 2**, the
first of §6's nine lemmas, by applying `uSExpressivelyCompleteOverDensePrior`
(`PriorExpressivenessDense.lean:302`) to the monadic formula `ρ`.

## The source, verbatim

Printed p.176, the definition of a contemporaneous equivalence relation:

> Suppose that `ε(x, y)` is a monadic formula with two free variables `x` and `y`. We say that
> `ε` defines a *contemporaneous equivalence relation* if and only if on any temporal structure
> `M`, if we define the binary relation `∼_M` by
>
> `a ∼_M b  iff  M ⊨ ε(a, b)`,
>
> then
>
> * `∼_M` is an equivalence relation on the domain of `M`,
> * `∼_M` partitions `M` into intervals and
> * `ε` depends only on contemporary properties: i.e. for all `a, b ∈ M`,
>   `M ⊨ ε(a,b)  iff  M | [a,b] ⊨ ε(a,b)`.
>
> A binary relation `∼` on a structure `M` is called a *contemporaneous equivalence relation* if
> and only if it is defined as `∼_M` by such an `ε`.

Printed p.177, the definition of `ρ`:

> Given such an `ε`, define `ρ(x)` as
>
> ```
>     ∃y > x  ¬ε(x, y)
>   ∧  ¬∃z(ε(x, z) ∧ ∀y > z  ¬ε(x, y))
>   ∧  ¬∃z(x < z ∧ ¬ε(x, z) ∧ ∀y(x < y < z → ε(x, y))).
> ```
>
> This says that `x`'s `∼`-class ends in a gap on the right. Dually we can define `λ(x)` about
> left ends. Note that the end of the whole structure is not a gap and that `ρ` will not hold of
> points in the last `∼_M` class (if there is such a class).
>
> Now by the expressive completeness of `U` and `S` there is temporal `R` true in any Prior
> structure exactly where `ρ(x)` is.

Printed p.177, **Lemma 2**:

> **LEMMA 2** *Suppose that `ε` defines the contemporaneous equivalence relation `∼_N` on any
> structure `N`.*
>
> *Then there is an `US`-formula `R` which holds in any Prior structure `N` exactly at those
> points whose `∼_N`-class ends in a gap on the right.*
>
> Dually `L`.

## CORRECTION TO THE LOCAL CORPUS — `ρ` HAS THREE CONJUNCTS, NOT TWO

The pre-segmented markdown chunk
`~/Projects/Literature/sources/reynolds_1992/sec03_6-no-gaps-between-equivalence-classes.md`
renders `ρ` as a **two**-conjunct formula

```
∃y > x ¬ε(x, y) ∧ ¬∃z(x < z ∧ ε(x, z) ∧ ∀y(x < y < z → ε(x, y)))
```

which differs from the printed page in two places: the entire **middle** conjunct
`¬∃z(ε(x,z) ∧ ∀y > z ¬ε(x,y))` is missing, and the negation on `ε(x,z)` in the final conjunct
has been dropped. The formula transcribed below is the printed one, read off the page image of
the source PDF (`Reynolds_1992_Axiomatization_Until_Since_without_IRR.pdf`, PDF page index 12 =
printed p.177) rather than off the markdown chunk, whose OCR-derived text layer is degraded
exactly at this display formula.

The correction is not cosmetic. The three conjuncts are, in order:

1. `∃y > x ¬ε(x,y)` — the class does **not** extend forever to the right;
2. `¬∃z(ε(x,z) ∧ ∀y > z ¬ε(x,y))` — the class has **no last point**;
3. `¬∃z(x < z ∧ ¬ε(x,z) ∧ ∀y(x<y<z → ε(x,y)))` — there is **no first point after** the class.

"Ends in a gap on the right" is exactly the conjunction of these three: a Dedekind gap is a cut
with no greatest element below and no least element above, and (1) is what makes the cut exist at
all. The corpus' two-conjunct version is not merely weaker — it is *wrong*: its second conjunct,
read against a class that partitions `M` into intervals, says "no point of the class lies strictly
above `x`", i.e. `x` is the class's maximum, which is the negation of clause 2 rather than a
weakening of it. Nothing downstream of `rhoFormula` can be trusted against the corpus text.

Plan v8's Phase 17 task list quotes the corrupted two-conjunct form. This module transcribes the
printed source instead, per the standing literature-fidelity directive; see the phase deviation
record.

## What has no source

Reynolds writes only *"Dually we can define `λ(x)` about left ends"* and *"Dually `L`"* — he
prints no formula for `λ` and no statement for `L`. `lambdaFormula` and `gapLeftFormula` below
are therefore **this tree's mirror**, obtained by reversing every order comparison in `ρ` and
leaving `ε`'s argument order alone (`ε` is symmetric as a relation, by clause (i)). They are
labelled as such at each declaration and are not presented as transcriptions.

`ContempEquivDense` is likewise a rendering choice rather than a quotation: Reynolds states the
three clauses in prose over an unspecified satisfaction relation, and clause (ii) — *"partitions
`M` into intervals"* — is rendered here as **convexity of each class**, which is what "partitions
into intervals" amounts to once (i) has made the classes a partition.

## The uniformity Reynolds relies on

Lemma 2 asserts one `R` that works in **any** Prior structure `N`, not one `R` per structure.
That uniformity is inherited directly from `uSExpressivelyCompleteOverDensePrior`, whose subtype
value `A` is produced *before* any structure is supplied and whose property is then universally
quantified over `M`. It is the same uniformity Reynolds flags at §5, printed p.176:

> Note the uniformity of the translation over the whole of `S`.

`reynolds_lemma2` below is stated in exactly that shape — `∃ R : Formula, ∀ M, …` — so the
quantifier order is visible in the statement rather than left to a reader's trust. Reynolds'
Lemma 9 (Phase 22) consumes precisely this: it applies `R` to a *surgered* structure `N` that is
not the `M` the formula was produced from.

## Can the landed `ContempEquiv` be reused?

**No**, for two independent reasons, and the phase's charter asks that this be recorded rather
than resolved by silently generalizing the landed definition. The landed `ContempEquiv`
(`IntegerModel/GoodStructures.lean:729`) is untouched by this module.

1. **Wrong kind of object.** `ContempEquiv sig k M a b` is `VeryGood sig k (M.subinterval sig
   (min a b) (max a b))` — a semantic relation with no defining monadic formula. Reynolds' §6
   needs `ε` *syntactically*: `ρ` and `λ` are built by quantifying over `ε`'s two free variables,
   and there is nothing to quantify over in a `VeryGood` predicate. A formula-free relation cannot
   be fed to expressive completeness, which is what Lemma 2 is.
2. **Its equivalence theorem is unavailable at a dense carrier.** `contemp_equiv_is_equiv`
   (`GoodStructures.lean:749`) carries `[SuccOrder M.carrier]` and `[NoMaxOrder M.carrier]`.
   `false_of_succOrder_dense` below proves that these two together with `DenselyOrdered` are
   *contradictory*, so on the dense flows this development targets the landed clause-(i) theorem
   has no instance at all. This is machine-checked here rather than asserted.

So `ContempEquiv` is at best a candidate *instance* of `IsContempEquivDense` at a discrete
carrier, never the general notion §6 quantifies over. No dense sibling of `ContempEquiv` is
introduced; `ContempEquivDense` is the §6 notion, parameterized by `ε`.

The machine-checked half of the `ContempEquiv`-reuse verdict recorded in the module header. -/

/-- **A densely ordered flow with no maximum admits no `SuccOrder`.**

Given a point `a`: `NoMaxOrder` supplies `b > a`, so `Order.succ a ≤ b` and `a ≤ Order.succ a`.
If `a = Order.succ a` then `Order.succ a ≤ a`, making `a` a maximum, which `NoMaxOrder` forbids.
Otherwise `a < Order.succ a`, and density supplies `c` strictly between, whence
`Order.succ a ≤ c < Order.succ a`.

which establishes clause (i) for the landed `ContempEquiv`, carries `[SuccOrder M.carrier]` and
`[NoMaxOrder M.carrier]` and therefore has **no instance** on a densely ordered flow. The landed

/-! ## The three clauses

Reynolds' bullets, printed p.176. Clause (ii), *"`∼_M` partitions `M` into intervals"*, is
rendered as convexity of each class; clause (iii) uses `M.subinterval` (`MonadicFO.lean:215`) for
Reynolds' `M | [a,b]`, with `min`/`max` endpoints so that the clause is stated for every ordered
pair without presupposing `a ≤ b` — the same convention the landed `ContempEquiv` uses. -/

/-! ### The structure class the clauses are quantified over

Reynolds states clauses (i) and (ii) *"on any temporal structure `M`"*, and §6's surgery
constructions duly apply them at structures built from `M`. The one `ε` §8 actually produces
(`epsDense`) satisfies them only at **countable, densely ordered** flows, so §6 is stated here
against an arbitrary class `C` of structures rather than against either reading.

`C := UnrestrictedClass sig` recovers Reynolds' own quantification verbatim; `C := CountableDense
sig` is the reading `epsDense` supports. Membership is carried as a **class**, `InStructureClass`,
so that the quantifier lives on binder lines and no call site in §6 has to mention it — the same
device `IsContempEquivDenseCD` already uses with its `[Countable _] [DenselyOrdered _]` binders. -/

/-- **`ε` defines a contemporaneous equivalence relation on the class `C`** — Reynolds 1992,

Clause (i) is split into `refl` / `symm` / `trans` with the class restriction riding on `trans`
alone. That is not a convenience: it is measured against the only `ε` §8 produces. `simDense_refl`
(`RealModel/EpsilonDense.lean:136`), `simDense_symm`, `simDense_convex` and
`simDense_contemporary` carry **no** instance hypotheses, and `simDense_trans` is
the sole one that does. Transitivity is exactly what fails away from a countable dense flow — the
`(0,1]` counterexample in `EpsilonDense`'s module header. So `refl` and `symm` are left free of the
class entirely, which is what keeps the dual transport's own `refl`/`symm` branches from needing
any closure hypothesis. Clause (ii) is gated as well, for the reason recorded at its field; clause
(iii) is not, because it holds of `epsDense` at every structure.

`equiv` below reassembles clause (i), so call sites read exactly as they did when it was a single
`Equivalence` field.

Note this is a property of `ε` alone. `ContempEquivDense M ε` is the relation; this is the
predicate saying that relation deserves the name, with transitivity asked only at `M` in `C`. -/

/-! ## The countable-dense bundle

`IsContempEquivDense` above quantifies its clauses over **every** structure. That is the
convenient reading for Reynolds' §6, whose surgery constructions apply the clauses at structures
built from `M` — in particular at `surgeredStructure M ε Q t`, which collapses a bad interval to a
single class.

**A correction to an earlier version of this note.** It asserted that the surgered structure is
therefore **not** densely ordered, on the ground that Lemma 4 gives no first class in a maximal
interval, so the points below the surviving class are removed and adjacency appears. That
inference does not go through: Lemma 4 quantifies over **classes**, and adjacency additionally
requires the surviving class to have a least element, which Lemma 6's first clause rules out. The
surgered structure **is** densely ordered whenever `M` is — see
`denselyOrdered_surgeredStructure` and `countable_surgeredStructure` (`NoGaps.lean`), both landed
and sorry-free. So the unrestricted reading is a convenience here, not a necessity.

It is the wrong reading for the one `ε` §8 actually produces. Reynolds' `ε(x,y)` of §8 Lemma 12
(`epsDense`, `RealModel/EpsilonDense.lean`) defines `∼_M`, and `∼_M` is an equivalence relation
only on a **countable, densely ordered** flow: `EpsilonDense`'s module header exhibits the
counterexample without density — with `M | (a,b) ≅ (0,1]` having a maximum `x` and `M | (b,c)`
very good, `a ∼ b` and `b ∼ c` but `M | (x,b)` is empty, so `a ≁ c` — and countability enters
through Lemma 11. So `IsContempEquivDense (epsDense sig k)` is **false**, not merely unproved.

`IsContempEquivDenseCD` is that weaker reading, and it is exactly what Doets' theorem needs:
Reynolds states D1 and D2 for *"any contemporaneous equivalence relation `∼` on `M`"* where `M`
is his countable dense endpointless flow, so the at-countable-dense quantification is the
source-faithful one at the D1/D2 boundary.

Only the two clauses that need it are restricted. Clause (iii) is left quantified over every
structure, because `simDense_contemporary` carries no instance hypotheses — keeping the bundle
as strong as `epsDense` actually supports, which is what gives whoever discharges D1/D2 the most
to work with. -/

`IsContempEquivDenseCD` itself is untouched by the class parameterization, so `epsDense`'s witness

are unaffected. -/

/-- **The countable-dense bundle in the class-parameterized form §6 consumes.**

The converse of `isContempEquivDenseCD_of_countableDense` is *not* free, and the two extra
hypotheses are exactly the gap: `IsContempEquivDenseCD` bundles clause (i) as a single
`Equivalence` at a countable dense flow, from which unrestricted reflexivity and symmetry cannot be
recovered.

For the one `ε` §8 produces both are available and neither is an extra assumption:
`simDense_refl` (`RealModel/EpsilonDense.lean:136`) and `simDense_symm` carry no instance
hypotheses. So `epsDense` satisfies
`IsContempEquivDenseOn (epsDense sig k) (CountableDense sig)` outright; assembling that witness
belongs with `epsDense_isContempEquivDenseCD` in `EpsilonDense.lean` and is deliberately left to
that file's owner rather than reached into from here. -/

Named semantic readings, so that Lemma 2's statement can be phrased in Reynolds' words rather
than in De Bruijn indices, and so that the transcription above is *checked* against its intended
meaning rather than asserted (`rhoFormula_eval`, `lambdaFormula_eval`). -/

/-- **`x`'s `∼`-class ends in a gap on the right** — the semantic content of `ρ`, one conjunct per
printed line:

1. the class does not extend forever to the right;
2. the class has no last point;
3. there is no first point after the class.

Their conjunction is precisely a Dedekind gap at the class's right end, together with the
existence of the cut. -/

> *Then there is an `US`-formula `R` which holds in any Prior structure `N` exactly at those

The quantifier order is the content: `∃ R` comes **before** `∀ N`, so a single `R` serves every
Prior structure. Lemma 9 (Phase 22) applies this `R` to a structure obtained by surgery on the
one it was produced from, and that step is legitimate only because of this ordering.

Reynolds' standing hypothesis *"Suppose that `ε` defines the contemporaneous equivalence relation
`∼_N` on any structure `N`"* is **not** needed for this lemma and is therefore not carried here:
the derivation is one application of expressive completeness to `ρ`, which is a monadic formula
whatever `ε` is. `reynolds_lemma2_of_contemp` restates the result with the source's hypothesis in
place, for consumers written against Reynolds' literal statement. -/

/-! ## Anti-vacuity

`IsContempEquivDense` is a three-clause universally quantified property; a version of it that no
`ε` satisfies would make every §6 lemma downstream of Lemma 3 vacuous. One inhabitant is exhibited
here.

What is **not** established at this phase: that `EndsInGapOnRight` ever *holds*. Exhibiting that
needs a structure with an actual gap, which is Phase 22's chronicle instance. The witness below
goes the other way — it shows `ρ` is correctly refuted when the class is everything — so it pins
`rhoFormula`'s truth conditions without claiming more than is proved. -/

single class is the whole structure. -/

are true outright. -/

/-- **`ρ` is refuted where it should be.** When every point is contemporaneous with every other,
no class ends in a gap, and `EndsInGapOnRight` fails at every point — its first conjunct asks for
a non-equivalent point above. So `gapRightFormula` is not a tautology in disguise. -/
