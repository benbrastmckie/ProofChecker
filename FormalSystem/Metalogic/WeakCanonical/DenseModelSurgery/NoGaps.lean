# Reynolds §6 Lemma 9 and Theorem 4: the classes do not end at gaps

Reynolds 1992, *An Axiomatization for Until and Since over the Reals without the IRR Rule*,
§6 *"No gaps between equivalence classes"*, printed **pp.182-183**.

This module closes §6. `TruthTransfer.lean` proved **Lemma 8** — a whole bad interval may be
replaced by one of its `∼`-classes without changing any temporal truth value at a surviving
point. **Lemma 9** turns that around into a *reductio*: the replacement produces a structure in
which `R` both must and cannot hold at the surviving class, so there was never a bad point to
begin with. **Theorem 4** is the resulting statement, and is the **D1** hypothesis of Doets'
theorem.

## Measured page range

The §6 page map is `printed = PDF page + 164`. Lemma 9 and Theorem 4 were the one §6 row the map
could only **extrapolate**; both pages were therefore read as **200 dpi images**
(`pdftoppm -f 18 -l 19 -r 200`), not from `pdftotext`:

* PDF p.18 carries the printed running header **182**, and holds the tail of Lemma 8's backward
  cases followed by the **whole of Lemma 9**, statement and proof.
* PDF p.19 carries the printed running header **183**, and opens with the **statement of
  Theorem 4**, immediately followed by §7 *"Separability"*.

So the measured range is **pp.182-183**, confirming the extrapolation. An earlier plan revision
carried `pp.180-181`; that figure was never measured and is **wrong**.

## The source, verbatim

Printed **p.182**:

> **LEMMA 9** *In fact there can't have been any bad points anyway.*
>
> **PROOF.** By lemma 8, `R` holds in `I` in `N`.
>
> But by lemma 2, `R` holds at a point in any Prior structure (not just `M`) if and only if the
> `∼`-class of the point ends in a gap (where `∼` is the appropraite equivalence relation for the

> continuing to hold as any counterexample point in `N` is also one in `M`.
>
> By the contemporaneity of `ε`, `I` as a subset of `N`, like `I` as a subset of `M`, is all in
> one `∼_N`-class. Could the class be bigger now?
>
> `R` is true of this class so that it is bounded above amongst other things. Thus `Q⁺` is
> non-empty and by lemma 6 begins with a point `q` say. Also by lemma 6 `¬R` holds at `q` in `M`
> and so in `N`. Clearly `q` is not in the class of `I` in `N`. Thus the class ends just before
> `q`.
>
> `R` can not have been true in this class after all.
>
> Thus we have proven...

Printed **p.183**:

> **THEOREM 4** *Suppose that `∼` is a contemporaneous equivalence relation on a Prior structure
> `M`.*
>
> *Then the `∼`-classes do not end at gaps.*

**Measured corpus divergence.** The printed page image spells *"appropraite"* in Lemma 9's second
paragraph; the local corpus markdown silently normalizes it to *"appropriate"*. The block quote
above reproduces the **image**. This is a corpus-conversion artifact, not a defect in Reynolds'
argument, and it is recorded only because §6's corpus text is under a standing accuracy warning.
No *displayed* formula occurs anywhere in Lemma 9 or Theorem 4 — the whole of both is inline
prose, which is the half of the corpus the standing warning rates as clean.

## Honest caveat on conditionality — what this module does and does not retire

**The standing §6 caveat is NOT retired by this module, and stays verbatim wherever it is
carried.** `## Conditionality after Theorem 4` at the foot of this file gives the
three-condition accounting: `HasBadIntervalSurgery` (introduced here, now discharged by
`StepD.hasBadIntervalSurgery`), the Prior pair (discharged at one named structure by
`ChronicleInstance.lean`), and `ε` (standing). Read that section before describing any §6 result
as discharged — none of them is.

/-! The structure class §6 is parameterized over, together with its dual-closure hypothesis; see
`IsContempEquivDenseOn` and `IsDualClosed` (`Defs.lean`, `Dual.lean`). `IsDualClosed` is carried at
file scope rather than per-declaration because the mirror halves of Lemmas 5-9 obtain their results
by running the unmirrored half at `dual M`, and every caller of those halves needs it too. At both
instantiations of `C` it is discharged by instance search, so no call site mentions it. -/

/-! ## *"`N` is a Prior structure"*

> And `N` is a Prior structure: we still have all the instances of Prior-U/S continuing to hold
> as any counterexample point in `N` is also one in `M`.

This is the one step of Lemma 9 that Reynolds disposes of in a subordinate clause and that needs
real work in Lean, and it is the step `TruthTransfer.lean` explicitly does **not** discharge.

The subordinate clause is the whole argument, and it is a *formula-level* argument: Prior-U is an
**axiom scheme**, so *"all the instances of Prior-U/S"* are temporal formulas, and Lemma 8 moves
temporal formulas between `M` and `N` at every surviving point. A counterexample point for an
instance in `N` is, by Lemma 8, a counterexample point for the same instance in `M`.

The landed `SemanticPriorU` (`PriorDefsDense.lean:119`) is stated with explicit carrier
quantifiers rather than as the truth of a formula, so the argument cannot be run on it directly:
a semantic transfer would have to produce, from *"`p` holds at every point of `N` in `(t,s)`"*,
the corresponding statement about every point of **`M`** in `(t,s)` — and the points of `Q₀ ∖ I`
are exactly the ones that fail. So the bridge below is not bureaucracy: it is what makes
Reynolds' one-clause justification available at all.

`priorUFormula p` is Reynolds' `U(⊤,p) ∧ F¬p → U(¬p ∨ K⁺(¬p), p)` (printed p.168) written out as
a `Formula`, and `temporalTruth_priorUFormula` checks — rather than asserts — that its truth at
`t` is exactly the body of `SemanticPriorU` at `t`. -/

`Kamp.kPlus_formula_correct`). Nothing here is new mathematics; they exist so that
`temporalTruth_priorUFormula` reads as the printed scheme rather than as a `simp` incantation. -/

/-! ### The past mirror

Written out rather than obtained by instantiation at `dual M`. `Dual.lean`'s `swapUS` does give
`swapUS (priorUFormula p) = priorSFormula (swapUS p)`, but the transport it feeds
(`semanticPriorS_dual`) runs `SemanticPriorU M → SemanticPriorS (dual M)` and the direction
needed here is the other one, at `M` itself; supplying it would be more new work than the
transcription below.

The transcription is not a *mirror* in the sense `Dual.lean` exists to avoid, either: Reynolds
prints `S(⊤,p) ∧ P¬p → S(¬p ∨ K⁻(¬p), p)` in his own abbreviation table on p.168, next to
Prior-U, so both schemes are quoted rather than one being invented from the other. Every step

/-! ## *"By the contemporaneity of `ε`, `I` … is all in one `∼_N`-class"*

> By the contemporaneity of `ε`, `I` as a subset of `N`, like `I` as a subset of `M`, is all in
> one `∼_N`-class. Could the class be bigger now?

The named appeal is to clause (iii) of `IsContempEquivDense`: `M ⊨ ε(a,b)` iff `M|[a,b] ⊨ ε(a,b)`.
Two points of `I` have the whole `M`-interval between them inside `I`, by convexity of a class,
and `I` survives the surgery — so `M|[a,b]` and `N|[a,b]` have *the same points*, and clause (iii)
read at `M` and at `N` sandwiches the two readings of `ε` together.

The construction is `isContempEquivDense_dualize`'s `contemporary` clause with
`surgerySubintervalIso` in place of `subintervalDualIso`; the landed `contempEquivDense_iso` does
the crossing in both.

Reynolds' follow-up question, *"Could the class be bigger now?"*, is answered by Lemma 9 itself
rather than here: this direction (`I` stays together) is all his argument uses, and the
possibility that the `∼_N`-class properly contains `I` is exactly what the reductio goes on to
refute. -/

/-! ## Lemma 9

> **LEMMA 9** *In fact there can't have been any bad points anyway.*

The proof is a reductio run on the surgery of Lemma 8, and it is transcribed step by step below.
Reynolds' six sentences become six named lemmas; the last of them closes the contradiction.

**The hypothesis Reynolds does not name.** His *"by lemma 6 begins with a point `q`"* is the third
clause of Lemma 6, which in this tree is `reynolds_lemma6_right_endpoint`
(`BadIntervals.lean:1281`). That declaration carries an explicit hypothesis `hbadR` — *"every bad
point at or above `t` is an `R`-point"* — because Reynolds' *"plainly impossible given `ρ`"* step
inside it needs Lemma 6's **first** clause (*"in any bad interval both `R` and `L` hold
throughout"*) at the boundary point, and the landed development declined to assume that silently.
`hbadR` is therefore carried here too, at the point where it is genuinely consumed, rather than
being smuggled into `IsBadIntervalSurgery`. Inside `Q₀` it is free — `endsInGapOnRight_of_mem`
below proves it from the interiority witnesses — but Reynolds' argument applies Lemma 6 at a point
of `Q⁺`, outside `Q₀`, and there it is a real assumption. See `## Conditionality after Theorem 4`
for what this costs. -/

/-! ## `I` has no endpoints

Reynolds' Lemma 4 — *"no last class and no first class in any maximal interval of `R`"* — is a
statement about **classes**. The two results below are the corresponding statements about
**points** of a single class, and they are what rule out the designated class `I` of a surgery
having a least or a greatest element.

The distinction is load-bearing. Removing the classes of `Q₀` below `I` creates adjacency in
`surgeredStructure M ε Q t` only if `I` has a least element; because it does not, `I` itself
supplies survivors arbitrarily close to its own lower edge, and the surgered structure is
densely ordered (`denselyOrdered_surgeredStructure`). An earlier record in this development
inferred point-adjacency from Lemma 4 directly and concluded the opposite; that inference does
not go through, and the source of the missing premise is Lemma 6's first clause, which
`IsBadIntervalSurgery.interior` already supplies at every point of `Q₀`. -/

/-- **`I` has no last point**: a class-mate of `t` strictly above any given point of the class.

`R` holds at every point of `Q₀` (`endsInGapOnRight_of_mem`), and `ρ`'s second conjunct is

/-- **`N` is densely ordered when `M` is** — printed p.181's *"the substructure of `M` whose
domain is just `Q⁻ ∪ I ∪ Q⁺`"*, shown dense.

Reynolds does not argue this, because his `∼` is contemporaneous at every structure and so he
never needs density at `N`. It is needed here to project clauses (i)/(ii) of the countable-dense
bundle at `N`, which is the single site in §6 that does so (`reynolds_lemma9`).

The proof cases on the two `SurgeryDomain` disjuncts at each endpoint:

* **both in `I`** — an `M`-dense point between them is in `I` by convexity of the class;
* **`x ∈ I`, `y ∉ Q₀`** — then `t < y`, and `I` has no last point, so a class-mate `w > x` exists;
  `w ∈ Q₀` and `y ∉ Q₀` above `t` put `w < y`;
* **`x ∉ Q₀`, `y ∈ I`** — the mirror, through `exists_contemp_lt_of_mem`;
* **both outside `Q₀`, straddling `t`** — `t` itself survives, by reflexivity;
* **both outside `Q₀`, on one side** — an `M`-dense point between them is outside `Q₀`, since a
  point of `Q₀` would have to lie beyond the further endpoint by convexity.

Note the clauses of `hε` are projected **only at `M`**, never at `N`: there is no circularity in
using this result to supply the instances that license the projection at `N`. -/

Stated as the reductio his proof actually runs: a bad interval carrying the surgery set-up of
Lemma 8, together with Lemma 6's first clause above `t`, is contradictory. *"There can't have been
any bad points"* is the informal reading of that — a bad point is what produces the interval.

The closing contradiction is the **third** conjunct of `EndsInGapOnRight` at `I` in `N`: that
conjunct says there is no first point after the class, and `q` is exactly one. Reynolds' *"Thus
the class ends just before `q`"* is that sentence, and his *"`R` can not have been true in this

/-! ## Theorem 4

> **THEOREM 4** *Suppose that `∼` is a contemporaneous equivalence relation on a Prior structure
> `M`.*
>
> *Then the `∼`-classes do not end at gaps.*

Reynolds writes *"Thus we have proven…"* and states Theorem 4 with no further argument: Lemma 9
**is** Theorem 4, once one knows that a point whose class ends in a gap gives rise to the bad
interval Lemma 8's surgery is performed on.

**That last step is named rather than assumed away.** `HasBadIntervalSurgery` below packages it.
It was introduced as a hypothesis because the tree could not then supply it; it is **now a
theorem** — `StepD.hasBadIntervalSurgery`, below `end Theorem4` — so the analysis in the rest of
this header records why it was hard, not a standing gap. The obstruction the analysis names was
real and is now closed by `exists_classInteriorToRInterval` (`BadIntervals.lean`).

What `HasBadIntervalSurgery` asks for is not the whole of Lemma 6
but one clause: *"in any bad interval both `R` and `L` hold throughout"* (printed p.180, Lemma
6's first clause). Everything else assembles from landed material —
`reynolds_lemma4_no_last_class` supplies the upper interiority witness and
`reynolds_lemma4_no_first_class` the lower, and the bad-connected component of the point is the
maximal interval. The obstruction is exact and was measured, not guessed:

* `IsBadInterval.saturated` is stated over `IsBadPoint`, i.e. over `R ∨ L`, so the bad-connected
  component of a point is the only candidate that satisfies it;
* but `IsBadIntervalSurgery.interior` demands `ClassInteriorToBadInterval`, which carries `R`
  **and** `L` throughout its segment;
* closing that gap is the implication `L → R` at a point where only `L` is known. The landed
  `endsInGapOnRight_of_endsInGapOnLeft` (`BadIntervals.lean:1346`) proves it, but only from a
  `ClassInteriorToLInterval` witness, and producing that witness at a merely-`L` point was exactly
  what was missing.

The same clause is why `reynolds_lemma6_right_endpoint` carries its own `hbadR` hypothesis, and
why `reynolds_lemma9` above carries it too. So the gap was one gap, in one place, and it was the
same one in all three declarations.

**It is now closed.** `exists_classInteriorToRInterval` (`BadIntervals.lean`) produces the
witness, and `endsInGapOnRight_of_endsInGapOnLeft'` is the resulting hypothesis-free `L → R`. The
third bullet above is therefore a record of the obstruction, not a description of a live one. The
two remaining conditions on everything below Theorem 4 are the Prior pair and `ε`; no §6 result
may be described as discharged. See `## Conditionality after Theorem 4`. -/

/-! ## Discharging `HasBadIntervalSurgery`

`HasBadIntervalSurgery` was introduced above as a *named hypothesis* standing in for Lemma 6's
first clause. It is discharged here, outright, with no new assumption.

What made it a hypothesis was not a step Reynolds waved away — he proves Lemma 6's clause over
five paragraphs on printed p.180, and both halves have been landed in `BadIntervals.lean` since
Phases 20 and 20.4. What was missing was the *hypothesis discharge*: both landed halves consume an
interval witness, and nothing produced one. `exists_classInteriorToRInterval`
(`BadIntervals.lean`) is now that producer, and with it
`endsInGapOnLeft_of_endsInGapOnRight'` / `endsInGapOnRight_of_endsInGapOnLeft'` give Lemma 6's
first clause with no interval hypothesis at all. That, plus the observation that `Q` may be taken
to be the **bad-connected component** of `t`, is everything the surgery structure asks for.

`Btw t x q` says `q` lies weakly between `t` and `x`, in whichever order the two come; `badComp`
is the set of points `x` such that every point between `t` and `x` is bad. Convexity and
saturation of that set are immediate; the real work is `IsBadIntervalSurgery.interior`, which
needs a **single** segment straddling `p`'s class that also contains a second arbitrary component
point `u`. It is obtained by extending the `exists_classInteriorToRInterval` witness by
`min`/`max` against `u` and pulling the extension back into the component by convexity. -/

The `interior` field is the only real work. Given a component point `p` and a second arbitrary

with `R` throughout `[a₀, b₀]`; saturation puts `a₀` and `b₀` themselves in the component; and
`min a₀ u`, `max b₀ u` then straddle `p`'s class while bracketing `u`, with the whole segment
pulled back into the component by convexity.

Note that the `left_out` and `right_out` branches are **not** symmetric in this rendering: the

/-! ## Conditionality after Theorem 4

Theorem 4 stood on **three** conditions. Their status is now different from one another, and the
accounting below is the whole of it. **The standing §6 caveat is not retired.**

**Condition one — `HasBadIntervalSurgery`: fully gone.** This was the third condition, introduced
by this module as a named hypothesis standing in for Lemma 6's first clause. It is now a theorem —
`StepD.hasBadIntervalSurgery`, above — holding at every structure with no extra assumption, so
`no_gaps_dense_prior` and `no_gaps_dense_prior_left` no longer carry it. The hypothesised forms
are retained unweakened as `no_gaps_dense_prior_of_hasBadIntervalSurgery` and
`no_gaps_dense_prior_left_of_hasBadIntervalSurgery`.

**Correcting the record about Reynolds.** An earlier version of this section said that his Lemma 6
*"states the clause and he takes it as established"*. **That is wrong**, and it mislocated the
gap. Reynolds gives a five-paragraph proof on printed p.180, with an explicit three-case analysis
and an explicit Prior-U contradiction, and **both halves of the clause have been landed in this
tree since Phases 20 and 20.4** (`endsInGapOnLeft_of_endsInGapOnRight` and
`endsInGapOnRight_of_endsInGapOnLeft`, `BadIntervals.lean`). What was actually missing was the
**hypothesis discharge**: both landed halves consume a `ClassInteriorToRInterval` /
`ClassInteriorToLInterval` witness and nothing in the tree produced one, on either side. That
producer is now `exists_classInteriorToRInterval`. It in turn needed the **repaired** reading of
Reynolds' Lemma 4 display — see the *"Lemma 4 at the boundary"* section of `Lemma34.lean` for the
one-symbol defect in the source, whose it is, and what the repair is.

**Condition two — the structure (Prior-U / Prior-S): gone at one named structure, standing in
general.** These remain hypotheses of every declaration in this file, as they must, since the file
is parametric in `M`. `ChronicleInstance.lean` discharges them at
`chronicleIsDensePriorSepStructure`, which is the structure the completeness route actually runs
on. Note that the reason that instantiation lives in a separate module is **layering, not
cyclicity**: the earlier claim in this section that *"`ChronicleMonadicBridge` imports
`WeakCanonical`, so a module under `WeakCanonical/DenseModelSurgery/` cannot import it back"* is
**refuted** against the actual transitive closure — the bridge imports zero `DenseModelSurgery`
modules and this file imports zero `BXCanonical` modules. The import would be legal; it is
declined because it would make a low-level parametric §6 module depend on a 280-module cone.

**Condition three — `ε`: standing, unchanged.** *"The only `ε` this tree can exhibit satisfying
`IsContempEquivDense` is `epsTop`, for which `EndsInGapOnRight` is empty"* (`Defs.lean`'s
`isContempEquivDense_epsTop` and `not_endsInGapOnRight_epsTop`). **Nothing above changes this.**
There is still **no live non-trivial instance** of anything in `Lemma5.lean`,
`BadIntervals.lean`, `Dual.lean`, `TruthTransfer.lean`, `ChronicleInstance.lean` or this file, and
an instantiation at `epsTop` is vacuous rather than an anti-vacuity witness. Reynolds' actual `ε`,
the one that defines `∼_M`, is §8 Lemma 12 and is not yet in this tree.

**What this module establishes, unconditionally in its own hypotheses.** `reynolds_lemma9` is
sorry-free and axiom-clean: given the surgery set-up and Lemma 6's first clause, a class ending in
a gap is contradictory. `StepD.hasBadIntervalSurgery` is sorry-free and axiom-clean and needs no
hypothesis beyond `IsContempEquivDense ε` and the Prior pair. `surgeredSemanticPriorU` /
`surgeredSemanticPriorS` are sorry-free with no extra hypothesis at all beyond Lemma 8's — *"`N`
is a Prior structure"*, the step `TruthTransfer` left open, is fully discharged.

**So: the §6 conditionality caveat stays, verbatim, in every module header that carries it** —
`Lemma5.lean`, `BadIntervals.lean`, `Dual.lean`, `TruthTransfer.lean` and this file. Halves one
and two of that caveat are unchanged text. Only the *third* condition is retired, and only the
*structure* half is retired at a single named structure. **No §6 result below Lemma 2 may be
described as discharged.** -/
