# Reynolds §6 Lemmas 3 and 4: maximal `R`-intervals

Reynolds 1992, *An Axiomatization for Until and Since over the Reals without the IRR Rule*,
§6 *"No gaps between equivalence classes"*, printed pp.178-179.

This module continues `Defs.lean` (§6 vocabulary, `ρ`, `λ`, Lemma 2) with the next two lemmas.
Both are statements about the set where Reynolds' `R` holds; by `gapRightFormula_spec`
(`Defs.lean:384`) that set is, in any Prior structure, exactly `EndsInGapOnRight M ε`, so the
whole development below is carried out on that semantic predicate and transported to the temporal
formula `R` where Reynolds transports it — namely at each application of Prior-U and Prior-S.

## The source, verbatim

Printed p.178, the standing hypothesis under which §6's remaining lemmas are stated:

> Now suppose that `M` is a Prior structure and that `∼ = ∼_M` is a contemporaneous equivalence
> relation defined by `ε`. Although we will only need to consider densely ordered `M` for the real
> numbers proof, it will be seen that we prove the result for any Prior structure.

Printed p.178, **Lemma 3**:

> **LEMMA 3** *The maximal intervals in which `R` holds are open intervals which, if bounded, have
> elements of `M` as their (excluded) end points.*
>
> **PROOF.** Suppose that `R` holds at `t ∈ M`. Clearly `ρ` holding at `t` implies that `R` will
> hold for a while after `t`: up until a gap in fact. Thus `t` is in a non-singleton interval of
> `R`. It is possible that `R` holds for ever after `t`.
>
> If `R` does not hold for ever after `t` then Prior-U applied to `R` implies that `M` contains a
> last point of this stretch of `R` (plainly impossible given `ρ`) or a first point of `¬R`. This
> is as claimed.
>
> Now look to the left of `t`. Looking back from just after `t` we can use Prior-S and see that
> either `R` is true always before `t`, there is a last point of `¬R` just before this stretch of
> `R` or there is no last point of `¬R`, but instead a first point of `R`. We must rule out the
> third case. Note that in the case of `M` not being dense there may be both a last point of `¬R`
> and a first point of `R`: this possibility, subsumed in the second case above, is acceptable in
> that it implies an excluded end point.
>
> Suppose, for contradiction, that `s` is this first point of `R` so that
> `M ⊨ (R ∧ K⁻(¬R))(s)`. The `∼`-class containing `s` can not stretch for ever into the future for
> then it does not end in a gap. Neither can it stretch to the end of the maximal interval of `R`
> as it would again not end at a gap.
>
> Thus there are other classes in this interval continuing on the other side of the gap which ends
> `s`'s. And for a while after the gap `R` continues to be true: we have not reached the end of the
> interval yet. Thus `R ∧ K⁻(¬R)` does not hold at the left hand end of any of these classes.
>
> Let `B` be the temporal formula saying that the `∼`-class we are now in begins with a point
> satisfying `R ∧ K⁻(¬R)`. `B` exists by expressive completeness. `B` holds in `s`'s class up to
> the gap and is false arbitrarily soon after the gap. This contradicts Prior-U applied to `B`. ∎

Printed pp.178-179, **Lemma 4**:

> **LEMMA 4** *There is no last class and no first class in any maximal interval of `R`.*
>
> **PROOF.** The last class in a maximal interval of `R` wouldn't end in a gap.
>
> By expressive completeness, the formula
>
> ```
> ρ(x) ∧ ∀y < x(¬ε(x, y) → ∃z(y < z < x ∧ ¬ρ(z)))
> ```
>
> has a temporal equivalent which is true only in the first classes of maximal intervals of `R`.
> If there is a first class then no immediately subsequent classes satisfy this and so we have this
> formula holding up to a gap and false arbitrarily soon afterwards. This contradicts Prior-U. ∎

## CORRECTION TO THE LOCAL CORPUS — Lemma 4's formula

This is the **second** corpus defect found in §6; the first, `ρ`'s missing middle conjunct, is
recorded in `Defs.lean`'s header. The pre-segmented chunk
`~/Projects/Literature/sources/reynolds_1992/sec03_6-no-gaps-between-equivalence-classes.md`
renders Lemma 4's displayed formula as

```
ρ(x) ∧ ∀y < x (y < z < x ∧ ε(y, z))
```

which differs from the printed page in four independent places:

1. the implication is gone — the printed matrix is `¬ε(x,y) → …`, and the corpus has dropped the
   entire antecedent, turning a conditional into an assertion;
2. the `∃z` binder is gone, leaving `z` **free** in what is presented as a formula of one free
   variable — the corpus text is not even well-formed;
3. the consequent's predicate is wrong: the printed text has `¬ρ(z)`, a one-place predicate about
   `z` alone, and the corpus has `ε(y,z)`, a two-place predicate about `y` and `z`;
4. consequently the quantifier nesting is flattened.

The formula transcribed below is the printed one, read off the page image of the source PDF
(`Reynolds_1992_Axiomatization_Until_Since_without_IRR.pdf`, PDF page index 15 = printed p.179)
rather than off the markdown chunk. The text layer of that page is degraded at exactly this
display formula, rendering it as `p(x) A vy <    z(y < z < x A` — so neither the chunk nor
`pdftotext` is usable here and the image is the only reliable witness.

The corrected formula is also the only one that *means* what Reynolds says it means. Read out:
`x`'s class ends in a gap on the right, and every `y` below `x` that is **not** in `x`'s class has
a point `z` between it and `x` at which `ρ` fails — i.e. at which `R` is false. That is exactly
"there is no earlier class in `x`'s maximal `R`-interval", which is Reynolds' stated reading,
*"true only in the first classes of maximal intervals of `R`"*. The corpus version, with `z` free
and `ε(y,z)` in place of `¬ρ(z)`, says nothing of the kind.

Plan v8's Phase 18 task list quotes the corrupted form (*"the temporal equivalent of
`ρ(x) ∧ ∀y<x (y<z<x ∧ ε(y,z))`"*). Per the standing literature-fidelity directive the printed
formula wins and the plan premise is reported as a deviation rather than silently followed.

## What is and is not a transcription here

Reynolds states Lemma 3 as one sentence about "the maximal intervals in which `R` holds". His
*proof* establishes three separable facts, and this module lands them as three named theorems plus
the assembled statement, so that a reader can check the transcription proof-step by proof-step:

| Reynolds' proof step | In-tree name |
|---|---|
| *"`ρ` holding at `t` implies that `R` will hold for a while after `t`"* | `endsInGapOnRight_forAWhile` |
| *"Prior-U applied to `R` … a first point of `¬R`"* | `reynolds_lemma3_right` |
| *"we must rule out the third case"* (no first point of `R`) | `reynolds_lemma3_no_first_point` |
| *"Prior-S … a last point of `¬R` just before this stretch"* | `reynolds_lemma3_left` |
| the assembled statement | `reynolds_lemma3` |

"Open interval" is rendered as: `R` holds on a two-sided neighbourhood of each of its points
(`reynolds_lemma3_open`). "If bounded, have elements of `M` as their (excluded) end points" is
rendered as the pair `reynolds_lemma3_right` / `reynolds_lemma3_left`: whenever `¬R` holds
somewhere above (resp. below) a point of the interval, there is a point **of `M`** bounding the
stretch at which `R` is false — so the endpoint is an element of `M` and is excluded, rather than
being a gap. These renderings are this tree's, not Reynolds' words; the words are quoted above.

## Auxiliary formulas are named, not inlined

Reynolds' §6 proofs repeatedly say *"by expressive completeness there is a temporal formula
saying …"*. Each such formula is landed here as a **named** monadic definition together with its
temporal equivalent and a specification theorem, rather than being produced inline inside a proof:

- `classBeginsAtGapStartFormula` / `classBeginsAtGapStartTemporal` — Lemma 3's `B`, *"the `∼`-class
  we are now in begins with a point satisfying `R ∧ K⁻(¬R)`"*;
- `firstClassFormula` / `firstClassTemporal` — Lemma 4's displayed formula.

Lemmas 5-8 (Phases 19-21) each need one or two more of these, and the pattern established here is
what makes them cheap.

/-! ## `ρ` is a property of the class, not of the point

Reynolds uses this without comment throughout §6 — *"the `∼`-class containing `s` can not stretch
for ever into the future"* treats "ends in a gap on the right" as a property of the class. It is
worth proving rather than assuming, because `EndsInGapOnRight`'s third conjunct mentions the point
`t` itself and not only its class. -/

last point of this stretch of `R` (plainly impossible given `ρ`) or a first point of `¬R`."*

carries its conclusion back to `EndsInGapOnRight`. -/

/-- **Reynolds 1992, §6 Lemma 3, printed p.178 — the right-hand end point.**

If `R` holds at `t` and fails somewhere above `t`, then there is a point `s` of `M` with `R`
throughout `(t, s)` and `¬R` at `s`: *"a first point of `¬R`"*. The end point is therefore an
element of `M` and is excluded from the interval, which is what the lemma claims for a bounded
maximal interval.

Reynolds' *"plainly impossible given `ρ`"* — the elimination of Prior-U's other disjunct, a last
point of the `R`-stretch — is discharged here by `endsInGapOnRight_forAWhile`: at such a last point
`R` would still hold, hence `R` would hold on a whole interval above it, contradicting the
`K⁺(¬R)` clause that the disjunct asserts. -/

/-! ## Lemma 3's auxiliary formula `B`

*"Let `B` be the temporal formula saying that the `∼`-class we are now in begins with a point
satisfying `R ∧ K⁻(¬R)`. `B` exists by expressive completeness."* (printed p.178)

Reynolds names `B` and leaves it at that. Written out, *"the class we are now in begins with `w`"*
is *"`w` is in `x`'s class and nothing in `x`'s class is below `w`"*, and `K⁻(¬R)(w)` — `¬R`
accumulating from below at `w` — is monadically `∀u < w ∃r(u < r < w ∧ ¬ρ(r))`, since `R` and `ρ`
agree in every Prior structure by Lemma 2. So `B`'s monadic source is

```
∃w( ε(x,w) ∧ ∀v(ε(x,v) → ¬ v < w) ∧ ρ(w) ∧ ∀u(u < w → ∃r(u < r ∧ r < w ∧ ¬ρ(r))) )
```

and `B` itself is its temporal equivalent. The three displayed conjuncts inside the scope of `∃w`
are, in order, *"`w` is in our class"*, *"`w` begins it"*, and *"`R ∧ K⁻(¬R)` holds at `w`"*.

This is landed as a named definition with a named semantic reading and a checked `eval` theorem,
rather than being produced inline inside Lemma 3's proof: Lemmas 5-8 (Phases 19-21) each need
formulas of exactly this shape, and `classBeginsAtGapStartFormula` is the pattern they follow. -/

/-- **Lemma 3's `B`, as a monadic formula** — *"the `∼`-class we are now in begins with a point
satisfying `R ∧ K⁻(¬R)`"* (printed p.178).

De Bruijn layout: free variable `0` is `x`. Under `∃w` the indices are `0 = w`, `1 = x`; under a
further `∀v` (or `∀u`) they are `0 = v`, `1 = w`, `2 = x`; under `∃r` inside `∀u` they are
`0 = r`, `1 = u`, `2 = w`, `3 = x`. -/

/-- **What `B` says** — the semantic reading of `classBeginsAtGapStartFormula`, in Reynolds'
words: `t`'s class has a least element `w`, and `R ∧ K⁻(¬R)` holds at `w`.

*"Begins with `w`"* is rendered as the printed `¬ v < w` rather than as `w ≤ v`; on a linear order
the two agree, and the negated form is what the monadic transcription literally contains. -/

/-- **The gap-crossing contradiction**, isolated once.

Reynolds runs the same argument at Lemma 3, at Lemma 4 and again at Lemmas 5 and 7: a formula that
*"holds in `s`'s class up to the gap and is false arbitrarily soon after the gap"* contradicts
Prior-U. Stated once here, with the two side conditions as hypotheses:

- `hin`: `P` holds throughout `s`'s class;
- `hout`: `P` fails at any point beyond the class that still has `R` throughout below it.

The proof is Reynolds': Prior-U applied to `P` at `s` produces a boundary point `s₁` for the
stretch on which `P` holds. `s₁` cannot be in the class, since the class has no last point. So
`(s, s₁)` cannot be inside the class either, or `s₁` would be *"the first point after the class"*,
which `ρ(s)`'s third conjunct forbids. The resulting point of `(s, s₁)` outside the class then has
`P` both true (it is inside Prior-U's stretch) and false (by `hout`).

Landed as a named, reusable theorem rather than repeated inline: Phases 20-21 (Lemmas 6 and 7)
need exactly this step, and it is the one place where Prior-U meets the gap. -/

There is no *first point of `R`*: no point at which `R` holds while `¬R` accumulates from below.

Reynolds' *"this contradicts Prior-U"* is the last third of the proof below. Prior-U applied to `B`
at `s` produces a boundary point `s₁` for the stretch on which `B` holds. `s₁` cannot lie in `s`'s
class, because the class has no last point and `B` holds throughout it. So `s₁` lies above the
class — and then `(s, s₁)` cannot be contained in the class either, since `s₁` would be *"the first
point after the class"*, which `ρ(s)`'s third conjunct forbids. The point of `(s, s₁)` outside the
class then has `B` true (it is inside Prior-U's stretch) and `B` false (it is outside the class
with `R` throughout below it). That is the contradiction. -/

> *The maximal intervals in which `R` holds are open intervals which, if bounded, have elements of

Stated at a point `t` of such an interval, in four parts, which together are the printed sentence:

1. *open on the right* — `R` holds throughout a right-neighbourhood of `t`;
2. *open on the left* — `R` holds throughout a left-neighbourhood of `t`, whenever `t` has any
   point below it at all. The proviso is not a weakening: if `t` is the least element of `M` there
   is no left-neighbourhood to speak of, and Reynolds' own parenthesis *"note that the end of the
   whole structure is not a gap"* (printed p.177) is the remark that this case is not a gap case;
3. *bounded above ⟹ excluded end point in `M`* — `reynolds_lemma3_right`;
4. *bounded below ⟹ excluded end point in `M`* — `reynolds_lemma3_left`.

Parts 3 and 4 are what *"have elements of `M` as their (excluded) end points"* asserts: the
bounding point `s` is an element of `M`, and `¬R` holds there, so it is excluded from the interval
rather than being a gap. -/

Rendered as: above any point `t` where `R` holds there is a point `u` of a *strictly later* class,
with `R` holding throughout the whole of `[t, u]` — so `t`'s class is never the last one in its
maximal `R`-interval.

Reynolds' one-line proof is the argument already carried out in `exists_gt_notContemp_holds`: were
`t`'s class the last one, its right end would be the interval's right end, which
`reynolds_lemma3_right` puts *in `M`* — so the class would end at a point rather than at a gap,
contradicting `ρ(t)`'s third conjunct. This declaration is that theorem restated under Lemma 4's
name, not a second proof of it. -/

/-! ## Lemma 4 at the boundary: the repaired display

**This section records a defect in the source, not in the transcription above.**
`firstClassFormula` and `IsFirstClassPoint` are a faithful, symbol-for-symbol rendering of the
printed display and are **not modified**; the repaired variant lands here beside them.

Reynolds 1992, §6 Lemma 4, printed p.179, verified against the 200 dpi page image (the local
corpus's rendering of this display is corrupt in four places; the image is authoritative):

> *By expressive completeness, the formula*
> ```
> ρ(x) ∧ ∀y < x(¬ε(x, y) → ∃z(y < z < x ∧ ¬ρ(z)))
> ```
> *has a temporal equivalent which is true only in the first classes of maximal intervals of `R`.*

**The boundary configuration on which the displayed formula is false.** Take a maximal interval of
`R` bounded below, with its excluded left end point `r ∈ M` — the configuration Reynolds' own
Lemma 3 licenses — and let the first class of that interval be `(r, δ)` for a gap `δ`. Let `x` be
any point of that first class. The universal clause must hold at `y := r`, and it demands a `z`
with **`r < z < x`** and `¬ρ(z)`. But `(r, x)` lies inside `x`'s own class, where `ρ` holds
throughout, so no such `z` exists. The displayed formula is therefore **false** at `x`, even though
`x` *is* in a first class.

**What survives and what does not.** The display stays **sound** — true only in first classes —
which is the direction Reynolds' own Lemma 4 proof consumes, so `reynolds_lemma4_no_first_class`
above is correct as it stands. What fails is **completeness**: the display's conclusion is weaker
than the plain-English statement *"true only in the first classes"* that Lemma 6's second paragraph
(printed p.180) goes on to use, where *"the class can not be first in the bad interval"* has to
produce a class strictly below inside the same `R`-interval.

**The repair, and whose it is.** Reading the inner lower bound as **`y ≤ z`** rather than `y < z`
repairs it: at `y := r`, take `z := r` itself. The defect is **the source's**; the reading below is
**this tree's**. Reynolds' *proof* of Lemma 4 goes through unchanged for the repaired formula —
`reynolds_lemma4_no_first_class_closed` below is byte-for-byte the shape of
`reynolds_lemma4_no_first_class`, closing through the same `false_of_holds_throughout_class`, which
*is* his Prior-U argument factored out. That the same argument closes both is the evidence that the
repair is faithful to his prose even where it deviates from his display.

Should the attribution be disputed, the fallback statement is: the `≤` reading is this tree's
rendering choice, and Reynolds' Lemma 6 second paragraph is the evidence that the plain-English
reading is the one he actually uses. No code changes either way — the route depends only on the
repaired lemma being *provable*, which is machine-checked below. -/

/-- **Lemma 4's displayed formula with the inner lower bound read as `y ≤ z`** rather than the
printed `y < z`. See this section's header: the strict form is false at points of a first class
bounded below by an excluded end point `r ∈ M`, and that defect is the source's. Rendered as
`¬(z < y)` since the object language has only `<`. -/

/-! ## Anti-vacuity

Every theorem above is conditional on `IsContempEquivDense ε` **and** on `EndsInGapOnRight M ε t`.
`Defs.lean` exhibits an inhabitant of the first (`isContempEquivDense_epsTop`) and proves that the
second fails everywhere for that inhabitant (`not_endsInGapOnRight_epsTop`). So the witness that
keeps `IsContempEquivDense` non-empty is exactly the one at which every statement below Lemma 2 is
vacuously satisfied, and none of the lemmas above is yet known to have a non-trivial instance.

That is not a defect of this phase; it is the shape of Reynolds' argument. §6's whole point is to
*refute* the existence of a class ending in a gap, which Lemma 9 and Theorem 4 (Phase 22) finally
do — so a structure at which `EndsInGapOnRight` holds is precisely what §6 shows cannot exist in a
Prior structure once the surgery is available. Recording the state honestly here so that no reader
mistakes the conditional theorems above for statements with a live instance in hand. -/

/-- With the total relation as `ε`, Lemma 4's formula is refuted at every point of every structure
— its first conjunct is `ρ`, which `not_endsInGapOnRight_epsTop` refutes. The witness that makes
`IsContempEquivDense` inhabited is therefore not a witness that any of §6's later lemmas has
content; see this section's note. -/
