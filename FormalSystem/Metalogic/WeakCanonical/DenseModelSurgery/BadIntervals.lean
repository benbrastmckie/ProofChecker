# Reynolds §6 Lemmas 6 and 7: bad points and bad intervals

Reynolds 1992, *An Axiomatization for Until and Since over the Reals without the IRR Rule*,
§6 *"No gaps between equivalence classes"*, printed **pp.179-181**.

This module continues `Lemma5.lean` with the *bad point* / *bad interval* vocabulary and with
Lemmas 6 and 7.

## The source, verbatim

Printed **p.179**, last paragraph — the definition:

> We define a *bad* point to be where `R ∨ L` holds. We define a *bad* interval as a non-empty
> and maximal one in which `R ∨ L` holds throughout.

Printed **p.180**, **Lemma 6**:

> **LEMMA 6** *Bad points only occur in non-singleton bad intervals.*
>
> *In any bad interval both `R` and `L` hold throughout. Any bad interval, if bounded, has
> excluded end points in `M` (neither `R` nor `L` holds at these end points).*
>
> **PROOF.** We first show that `L` holds wherever `R` does. Suppose for contradiction that we
> have a maximal interval of `R` in which `L` fails to hold somewhere. So `¬L` holds throughout
> at least one `∼`-class. By the definition of `L`, there are two cases. Either this particular
> `∼`-class is one which includes its left hand end point or it is one which begins just after
> some point of `M`. The class can not be unbounded below for then it would be first in this bad
> interval.
>
> In fact we can not have a class beginning just after a point `r` of `M`. Since the class can
> not be first in the bad interval `r` itself must be in a `∼`-class in the bad interval. But
> `r`'s class can not end in a gap on the right when `r` must be its right hand end point.
>
> Thus we have a class in the bad interval which includes its left hand end point. Its not hard
> to use the previous result to show that throughout the bad interval all classes include their
> left hand end points.
>
> Let `B` be a temporal formula true at times which are not left hand end points of their
> `∼`-classes. `B` is then true continuously in any class from just after the left hand end point
> up until the gap at the right hand end point. `B` must be false arbitrarily soon after the gap
> contradicting Prior-U.
>
> Using mirror images of the above and previous results we get our proof. ∎

Printed **pp.180-181**, **Lemma 7**:

> **LEMMA 7** *If a formula `B` is true for a while at the start of a `∼`-class in a bad interval
> then it holds throughout the bad interval. Similarly at the end.*
>
> *If a formula is true anywhere in a bad interval it is true arbitrarily close to each end of
> each class in the interval.*
>
> **PROOF.** Suppose that `γ < δ` are gaps and that `(γ, δ)` is a `∼`-class within a bad interval.
>
> Suppose that `B` holds for a while after `γ` but that `¬B` holds somewhere in the bad interval.
> By lemma 5, `¬B` also holds somewhere in `(γ, δ)`.
>
> Using `ε` and expressive completeness we can find a temporal formula `C` which is true only at
> points within a `∼`-class after some `¬B` in that class. `C` will be false for a while at the
> beginning of each class and then true for a while at the end.
>
> In fact `C` is true for a while up to the gap at the end and false arbitrarily soon after the
> gap. This contradicts Prior-U.
>
> Applying the above to the negation of a formula gives us the second part. ∎

## LEMMA 6'S FOUR HALVES — all discharged, the fourth by duality transport

Lemma 6's proof ends *"Using mirror images of the above and previous results we get our proof."*
All four of its halves are discharged below (`reynolds_lemma6`), and no `sorry` stands in for
any of them.

The fourth — `R` holds wherever `L` does — is **not** a second proof. It is
`endsInGapOnLeft_of_endsInGapOnRight` instantiated at `(dual M, dualize ε)` through
`DenseModelSurgery/Dual.lean`, with the interval endpoints exchanged; the *"previous results"*
the mirrored argument appeals to are supplied by `reynolds_lemma5_first_left`, itself an
instantiation of `reynolds_lemma5_first` at the dual. An instantiation is what Reynolds' one
sentence actually says; a hand-written mirror would formalize a proof he did not write.

The `λ`-side interval hypothesis has no counterpart in the tree and is defined here as
`ClassInteriorToLInterval`, the exact mirror of `ClassInteriorToRInterval`.

Note that Lemma 7's mirror is landed here **by hand**, at `:968-1225`. It predates the transport
layer and is left exactly as it is — nothing is deleted, refactored or deprecated — but it is the
last mirror in this tree that should be written that way. It does not run into the `λ`-side
Lemma 5 question at all: a bad interval carries both `R` and `L` throughout
(`ClassInteriorToBadInterval`), so its Lemma 5 appeals use the `R` side directly even in the
past-directed argument.

## PAGE MAP — the plan's page references run one to two pages early

Measured against the page images of
`Reynolds_1992_Axiomatization_Until_Since_without_IRR.pdf`. The printed page number is the PDF
page number (1-based) plus 164 throughout §6.

| Material | PDF page (1-based) | Printed page | Plan v8 says |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ρ`, Lemma 2 | 13 | 177 | 177 ✓ |
| Lemma 3, Lemma 4 statement | 14 | 178 | 177 ✗ |
| Lemma 4 proof, Lemma 5, *bad point* / *bad interval* | 15 | 179 | 178 ✗ |
| Lemma 6, Lemma 7 statement + proof opening | 16 | 180 | 178-179 ✗ |
| Lemma 7 proof close, surgery set-up, Lemma 8 | 17 | 181 | 179 ✗ |

So Phase 20's material is on printed **pp.179-181**, not pp.178-179. Docstrings below use the
measured pages. This extends the drift Phases 18 and 19 recorded.

## CORPUS CHECK — no third defect; the §6 display warning is unchanged

The two §6 corpus defects recorded so far (`ρ`'s missing middle conjunct, under `Defs.lean`;
Lemma 4's mangled display, under `Lemma34.lean`) both sit at **displayed** formulas. Lemmas 6
and 7, and the *bad point* / *bad interval* definition, contain **no displayed formula at all** —
they are pure running prose. Every sentence block-quoted above was read off the page images and
agrees with
`~/Projects/Literature/sources/reynolds_1992/sec03_6-no-gaps-between-equivalence-classes.md`
word for word, with one printer's typo preserved here and normalised there (*"Its not hard"* on
the page; the corpus writes *"It's not hard"*). The §6 defect count therefore stands at **two**,
and the standing warning continues to apply to displays specifically.

## WHICH GAP-CROSSING LEMMA LEMMA 7 LICENSES — neither of the two already landed

The standing instruction was to determine which of the two landed forms Lemma 7 consumes before
using either. The answer is **neither**, and the reason is visible in Reynolds' own sentence
*"`C` will be false for a while at the beginning of each class and then true for a while at the
end"*.

* `false_of_holds_throughout_class` (`Lemma34.lean:595`, Phase 18) requires the auxiliary formula
  to hold **throughout** `s`'s class and to fail at **every** later point outside it. Reynolds'
  `C` fails both halves: it is false at the beginning of `s`'s own class, and it is true again
  near the end of every later class in the interval.
* `false_of_holds_throughout_class_bounded` (`Lemma5.lean`, Phase 19) weakens only the second
  half. Its `hin` still demands `C` throughout the class, which `C` does not satisfy.

`false_of_holds_throughout_class_from_bounded` below weakens **both** slots, and is the form
Lemma 7 actually licenses:

* `hin` is required only from `s` **onwards** inside the class — which is exactly *"true for a
  while at the end"*, since `C` is upward closed in a class;
* `hout` asks only that `C` be false **arbitrarily soon** after the gap (some failure point at or
  below each given point beyond the class), which is Reynolds' *"false arbitrarily soon after the
  gap"* read literally rather than as *"false everywhere after the gap"*.

Both earlier forms are left in place, unweakened and unrenamed; nothing that consumes them
changes. The new theorem is proved from scratch rather than by generalising either in place.

## Renderings that are this tree's, not Reynolds' words

* *"a maximal interval of `R`"* containing a whole class in its interior is rendered as
  `ClassInteriorToRInterval M ε a t b`: two points `a < t < b` outside `t`'s class with `R`
  holding throughout `[a, b]`. Reynolds obtains exactly this from Lemma 4 (*"There is no last
  class and no first class in any maximal interval of `R`"*), which supplies a class below and a
  class above; convexity of a maximal interval supplies `R` in between.
* *"non-empty and maximal one in which `R ∨ L` holds throughout"* is rendered as `IsBadInterval`,
  whose maximality clause is stated in **saturation** form — any point joined to a member by a
  stretch of bad points is itself a member. `IsBadInterval.maximal_among` derives the
  maximal-among-bad-intervals reading from it, so the rendering is checked rather than asserted.
* *"the class includes its left hand end point"* is rendered as the existence of a class-mate `w`
  with no class-mate strictly below it, matching the `¬ v < w` idiom `ClassBeginsWith`
  (`Lemma5.lean:278`) and `ClassBeginsAtGapStart` (`Lemma34.lean:434`) already use.

## Honest caveat, carried forward

Every §6 lemma below Lemma 2 remains **conditional**. `IsContempEquivDense ε` together with
Reynolds' Prior-U and Prior-S on `M` are hypotheses throughout, and the only `ε` this tree can
currently exhibit satisfying them is the total relation `epsTop` (`Defs.lean:461`), for which
`EndsInGapOnRight` is empty (`not_endsInGapOnRight_epsTop`). Nothing below is discharged at a
non-trivial instance; the first live instance is due at the Lemma 9 / dense-surgery stage. These
results are **not** to be described as discharged.

/-! ## *"we can not have a class beginning just after a point `r` of `M`"*

The second paragraph of the Lemma 6 proof, printed p.180. Reynolds' reason is that `r` *"must be

right. No temporal formula and no Prior axiom is involved: this is pure class calculus. -/

> not be first in the bad interval `r` itself must be in a `∼`-class in the bad interval. But
> `r`'s class can not end in a gap on the right when `r` must be its right hand end point.*

If `t`'s class begins just after `r` — `r` below the class, and everything in `(r, t)` inside it —
then `r` is the greatest element of its own class, so `ρ` fails at `r`. -/

/-! ## A class in the interior of a maximal interval of `R`

Reynolds' Lemma 4 — *"There is no last class and no first class in any maximal interval of
`R`"* — is what puts a class strictly inside its interval, with a class below and a class above.
This is that conclusion, packaged as the hypothesis the Lemma 6 and Lemma 7 proofs consume: two
witnesses `a < t < b` outside `t`'s class, with `R` throughout the closed segment `[a, b]`. -/

/-- **`t`'s class lies in the interior of a maximal interval of `R`**, witnessed by points `a`
below and `b` above it.

This is a *rendering*, not a quotation: Reynolds names the interval and appeals to Lemma 4 for
*"the class can not be first"* and for the class above. Convexity of a maximal interval supplies
`R` in between, which is `rThroughout`. -/

is Lemma 5: *"the class includes its left hand end point"* is the same as *"`¬B` holds somewhere
in the class"*, and Lemma 5's first statement carries *"holds somewhere in one class"* to *"holds
somewhere in each class in the interval"*. -/

/-! ## *"`B` must be false arbitrarily soon after the gap contradicting Prior-U"*

The last paragraph of the Lemma 6 proof, printed p.180. Prior-U is applied to `B` at a point `s`
of a class that is *not* its left hand end point; the boundary point Prior-U returns is trapped
between `s` and the left hand end point of a later class, and both of Prior-U's disjuncts fail
there. -/

/-- **Reynolds 1992, §6 Lemma 6, printed p.180 — final paragraph.**

> *Let `B` be a temporal formula true at times which are not left hand end points of their
> `∼`-classes. `B` is then true continuously in any class from just after the left hand end point
> up until the gap at the right hand end point. `B` must be false arbitrarily soon after the gap
> contradicting Prior-U.*

Hypotheses, in Reynolds' order: `s` ends in a gap on the right and is not the left hand end point
of its class (witnessed by the class-mate `v < s`); `b` lies beyond `s`'s class with `R`
throughout `(s, b)`; and every class the open segment `(s, b)` meets includes its left hand end
point.

The `b` here is not a weakening. Lemma 4 supplies a later class in the same maximal interval, and
convexity of the interval supplies `R` in between, which is exactly what
`ClassInteriorToRInterval` packages. -/

/-! ## The gap-crossing contradiction Lemma 7 actually licenses

See the module header for why neither `false_of_holds_throughout_class` (`Lemma34.lean:595`) nor
`false_of_holds_throughout_class_bounded` (`Lemma5.lean`) can be used here. Both slots are
weakened:

* `hin` only from `s` **onwards** in the class — Reynolds' *"true for a while at the end"*;
* `hout` only *"false **arbitrarily soon** after the gap"* — some failure point at or below each
  given point beyond the class, rather than failure at every such point.

The proof is the same Prior-U argument as its two predecessors: Prior-U applied to `P` at `s`
produces a boundary point `s₁` for the stretch on which `P` holds; `s₁` cannot lie in `s`'s class,
because the class has no last point and `P` holds throughout it from `s` on; so `(s, s₁)` cannot be
contained in the class either, since `s₁` would be *"the first point after the class"*, which
`ρ(s)`'s third conjunct forbids. `hout` then supplies a `P`-failure at or below the resulting point
of `(s, s₁)`, where Prior-U's stretch says `P` holds. -/

/-- **The gap-crossing contradiction, from `s` onwards and bounded.**

Strictly weaker in both hypothesis slots than `false_of_holds_throughout_class_bounded`
(`Lemma5.lean`), which is left in place unweakened and unrenamed together with all of its
consumers. Prior-S is not needed. -/

>
> *Suppose that `γ < δ` are gaps and that `(γ, δ)` is a `∼`-class within a bad interval. Suppose

> soon after the gap. This contradicts Prior-U.*

*"`(γ, δ)` is a `∼`-class within a bad interval"* is `hint`; *"`B` holds for a while after `γ`"*
is `hstart`, `B` at every class-mate of `t` below some class-mate `x`; *"throughout the bad
interval"* is the conclusion at every `u ∈ [a, b]`.

Reynolds' *"`C` will be false for a while at the beginning of each class"* is where Lemma 5 is
used a second time, on `¬C`: `¬C` holds at `x` outright, because `hstart` gives `B` at every
class-mate below `x`. -/

/-! ## The mirror: *"Similarly at the end"*

Reynolds discharges the second half of Lemma 7's first statement with the single word *"Similarly"*
(printed p.180). The mirror is not free: it runs on Prior-S rather than Prior-U, on `λ` rather than
`ρ`, and on the mirror auxiliary formula *"before some `¬B` in that class"*. Everything it needs
that the tree does not already have in mirrored form is landed below, with each declaration
labelled as a mirror rather than a transcription — Reynolds prints no text for any of it.

Lemma 5 is **not** mirrored, and does not need to be: `reynolds_lemma5_first` is already
two-sided in its two points (its `hIcc` runs over `[min t t', max t t']`), and it is stated over
`R`, which by Lemma 6 holds throughout a bad interval alongside `L`. That is why the hypothesis
package below carries both. -/

/-- **`λ` is a property of the `∼`-class**, the mirror of `endsInGapOnRight_congr`

/-! ## *"Any bad interval, if bounded, has excluded end points in `M`"*

Printed p.180, the third clause of Lemma 6's statement. This is Lemma 3's argument
(`reynolds_lemma3_right`, `Lemma34.lean:308`) run on `R ∨ L` in place of `R`: Prior-U applied to
the temporal formula `badPointFormula` produces a first non-bad point, which is an element of `M`
excluded from the interval.

Reynolds' *"plainly impossible given `ρ`"* step — the elimination of Prior-U's *last point of the
stretch* disjunct — needs `R` at the boundary point, which is Lemma 6's own first clause. It is
therefore taken as the hypothesis `hbadR` rather than silently assumed. -/

/-! ## *"Using mirror images of the above and previous results"* — the fourth half

Reynolds closes Lemma 6 with that one sentence and no second proof. It is discharged here as an
**instantiation** at `(dual M, dualize ε)` through `DenseModelSurgery/Dual.lean`, which is what
that sentence formalizes: a hand-written mirror would formalize a proof he did not write.

The `λ`-side interval hypothesis has no counterpart in the tree, so it is defined here as the
exact mirror of `ClassInteriorToRInterval`. -/

/-- **`t`'s class lies in the interior of a maximal interval of `L`** — the `λ`-side mirror of
`ClassInteriorToRInterval`, with `EndsInGapOnLeft` in place of `EndsInGapOnRight` and everything
else unchanged.

Like its `ρ`-side original this is a *rendering* rather than a quotation: Reynolds names the
interval and leaves the dual to his p.178 convention. -/

> *Bad points only occur in non-singleton bad intervals.*
>
> *In any bad interval both `R` and `L` hold throughout. Any bad interval, if bounded, has
> excluded end points in `M` (neither `R` nor `L` holds at these end points).*

Four halves. The first three are read off a class in the interior of a maximal interval of `R`:

1. the point is not an isolated bad point;
2. `L` holds wherever `R` does — Reynolds' *"we first show that `L` holds wherever `R` does"*;
3. the interval, if bounded on the right, has an excluded end point in `M`.

The **fourth** is Reynolds' closing *"using mirror images of the above and previous results we get
my proof"* — `R` wherever `L` holds. It takes the `λ`-side interval as its own hypothesis, since
nothing about a maximal interval of `R` supplies one, and is discharged by
`endsInGapOnRight_of_endsInGapOnLeft`.

**Standing caveat.** Like every §6 result below Lemma 2 this is **conditional**:
`IsContempEquivDense ε` together with Prior-U/Prior-S are hypotheses, and the only `ε` this tree
can currently exhibit satisfying them is `epsTop`, for which `EndsInGapOnRight` is empty. There
is no live non-trivial instance yet, and nothing here is discharged in the unconditional
sense. -/

/-! ## The interval witness, and Lemma 6's first clause without it

`ClassInteriorToRInterval` and `ClassInteriorToLInterval` were introduced above as *hypotheses*,
and nothing in this tree produced one on either side. `exists_classInteriorToRInterval` below is
that producer. It is what Reynolds' Lemma 4 was supposed to supply and — with the display as
printed — could not; see the *"Lemma 4 at the boundary"* section of `Lemma34.lean` for the
one-symbol defect in the source that blocked it, and for the repaired reading that unblocks it.

With the producer in hand, both halves of Lemma 6's first clause become hypothesis-free. -/

/-- **The interval witness, produced.** Wherever `R` holds, `t`'s class lies in the interior of a
maximal interval of `R`: there are `a < t < b` outside `t`'s class with `R` throughout `[a, b]`.

The **upper** endpoint is `reynolds_lemma4_no_last_class` used as it stands. The **lower** endpoint
is where the repaired Lemma 4 pays: negating `reynolds_lemma4_no_first_class_closed` gives a `y`
below `t`, outside `t`'s class, with `R` throughout the **closed** `[y, t)`, which is what
`rThroughout`'s closed `[a, b]` demands. The faithful strict form gives only the **open** `(y, t)`,
and shrinking `a` into `(y, t)` is unavailable in exactly the configuration where `t`'s class
begins immediately after `y ∈ M` — the boundary case documented in `Lemma34.lean`. -/
