# The order-duality transport layer for Reynolds §6

Reynolds 1992, *An Axiomatization for Until and Since over the Reals without the IRR Rule*,
§6 *"No gaps between equivalence classes"*.

Reynolds states §6's lemmas on **one side only** and discharges every dual with a single
sentence. Printed **p.178**:

> *Dually we can define `λ(x)` about left ends.*

and, closing Lemma 2, the bare sentence *"Dually L."*; and closing Lemma 6 (printed **p.180**):

> *Using mirror images of the above and previous results we get our proof.*

This module makes that sentence a **construction** rather than a second proof. It builds the
order-dual `dual M` of an `OrderedMonadicStructure`, the syntactic dualization `dualize` of a
`MonadicFormula` and `swapUS` of a `Formula`, and proves that `eval`, `TemporalTruth`, the
Prior-U/Prior-S pair, `∼` and the gap predicates all transport across. A §6 *"mirror image"*
then costs an instantiation at `(dual M, dualize ε)` rather than a hand-written module.

## Why `d` and not `OrderDual.toDual`

`dual M` reverses the order by taking `carrier := (M.carrier)ᵒᵈ`. Points are moved across with

```lean
def d (x : M.carrier) : (dual M).carrier := x
```

which is the **identity function**, definitionally. This is deliberate and load-bearing: routing
points through `OrderDual.toDual` instead reproduces the `.carrier`-unfolding mismatch that this
tree already documents for `orderedSum` at `NEquivalence.lean:134`, and it is what forces the
binder cases of `eval_dualize` into `Fin.cons` bookkeeping. With `d` in place those cases are
one-liners and the `lt` case of the transport is `Iff.rfl` — **order reversal is definitional**.

For the same instance-diamond reason `dual` is deliberately **not** `@[reducible]`.

## What does *not* transport: `IsContempEquivDense` clause (iii)

`IsContempEquivDense` (`Defs.lean`) has three clauses. Clauses (i) *"`∼_M` is an equivalence
relation"* and (ii) *"`∼_M` partitions `M` into intervals"* transport through
`contempEquivDense_dual` below. Clause (iii) — *"`ε` depends only on contemporary properties:
`M ⊨ ε(a,b)` iff `M | [a,b] ⊨ ε(a,b)`"* — **does not transport definitionally.**

The obstruction is **this tree's rendering, not Reynolds'**, and is recorded here as such.
Reynolds' `M | [a,b]` is an *unordered* interval: the pair `(a,b)` is not presumed ordered and
the interval is the same object either way round. `M.subinterval` (`MonadicFO.lean:215`) renders
it as a `Subtype` over the predicate `min a b ≤ x ∧ x ≤ max a b`; under order reversal `min` and
`max` exchange, and the dual's predicate is the *same two conjuncts in the opposite order*.

Measured here, and narrower than anticipated: the endpoint exchange itself **is** definitional —
`dual_min` and `dual_max` below are both `rfl`. What is not definitional is only the **order of
the two conjuncts** in the `Subtype` predicate. Before this module there was no
`eval`-along-a-carrier-isomorphism lemma in the tree to bridge that (`Kamp.eval_rename` is
variable renaming, not carrier transport); `eval_iso` below is that lemma.

**The escape taken here** is to build the missing bridge rather than to route around it:
`StructIso` and `eval_iso` below prove `eval` invariant along any order- and
interpretation-preserving equivalence of carriers, and `subintervalDualIso` instantiates that at
`Equiv.subtypeEquivRight (fun _ => and_comm)`, which is exactly the conjunct exchange. Clause
(iii) then transports like the other two, `IsContempEquivDense` is left unweakened and unrenamed,
and `eval_iso` is reusable for any later carrier transport (`Kamp.eval_rename` covers only
variable renaming).

For the record, had that bridge resisted, nothing would have been lost by dropping clause (iii)
instead: repo-wide it is consumed **nowhere** — `contemporary` appears only at its own
declaration and in the construction of the `epsTop` witness, and every §6 use of
`IsContempEquivDense` goes through `contemp_refl` / `contemp_symm` / `contemp_trans` /
`contemp_of_between` (`Lemma34.lean`), all of which read only clauses (i) and (ii).

## Retrospective subsumption

This layer subsumes two past/future mirrors this tree already paid for by hand — the Lemma 7
mirror at `BadIntervals.lean:968-1225` (258 lines) and `Kamp/Lemma53FaithfulPast.lean` (364
lines). **Neither is deleted, refactored or deprecated**; both stay landed exactly as they are,
and every existing consumer is untouched. The point of recording the subsumption is forward
looking: no later phase should derive a third mirror by hand when an instantiation at
`(dual M, dualize ε)` will do.

## Standing conditionality caveat

Every §6 result below Lemma 2 — including everything this module is used to build — is
**conditional**. `IsContempEquivDense ε` together with `SemanticPriorU` / `SemanticPriorS` are
hypotheses, and the only `ε` this tree can currently exhibit satisfying them is `epsTop`, for
which `EndsInGapOnRight` is empty. There is therefore **no live non-trivial instance** of any of
these lemmas yet, and nothing here is discharged in the unconditional sense. The anti-vacuity
witness arrives with Lemma 9 / Theorem 4.

nothing in the tree transported along a reindexing of *points*. `eval_iso` does, and it is what

for an arbitrary order- and interpretation-preserving equivalence, so it is reusable for any
later carrier transport, not only for this one. -/

/-! ## The hypothesis transports

`IsContempEquivDenseOn` is a property of `ε` alone, quantified over **all** structures (clauses (i)
`refl`/`symm` and (iii)) or over the class `C` (clause (i) `trans` and clause (ii)), so the
transport is not an instantiation at one structure: each clause is re-established at an arbitrary
`N` by running the original clause at `dual N`.

For the two class-gated clauses that means the transport needs `C (dual N)` wherever it has
`C N` — which is the first of the two closure conditions the class parameterization carries. It is
packaged as a class, `IsDualClosed`, so that `instInStructureClassDual` below discharges the
membership at `dual N` by instance search and no dual call site in §6 has to mention it. -/

/-- **`C` is closed under order-duals.** The first closure condition on a structure class: without
it the dual transport below cannot re-establish transitivity or convexity, since it establishes
both at `N` by running them at `dual N`. -/
class IsDualClosed {sig : MonadicSignature} (C : OrderedMonadicStructure sig → Prop) : Prop where
  /-- Duals stay in the class. -/
  out : ∀ M : OrderedMonadicStructure sig, C M → C (dual M)

/-- Membership transfers to the dual. Keyed on `dual _`, so instance search reaches for it only at
a genuinely dualized structure. -/

    (M : OrderedMonadicStructure sig) [InStructureClass C M] : InStructureClass C (dual M) :=
  ⟨IsDualClosed.out M InStructureClass.out⟩

/-- The class of all structures is trivially dual-closed. This is what makes every §6 result
instantiate at Reynolds' unrestricted reading with no extra argument. -/
instance instIsDualClosedUnrestricted : IsDualClosed (UnrestrictedClass sig) :=
  ⟨fun _ _ => trivial⟩

/-- The countable densely-ordered class is dual-closed. `OrderDual.denselyOrdered` supplies the
order half; `Countable αᵒᵈ` has **no** named Mathlib instance, so the countability half goes
through `inferInstanceAs`, which works because `OrderDual` is a plain `def` — the idiom already
used at `ChronicleMonadicBridge.lean:375`. -/

/-- **`IsContempEquivDenseOn` transports to `dualize ε`** — all clauses, with clause (iii)
crossing via `eval_iso` and `subintervalDualIso`.

`IsContempEquivDenseOn` itself is untouched: this is a new theorem about `dualize ε`, not a
weakening of the structure. The class is preserved rather than changed, which is what keeps the
~10 dual projection sites downstream in §6 free of any edit. -/
