/-! ## Decomposition Formulas and Lemma 11 (GHR93 Definition 8.8)

An (n;r)-decomposition formula describes a "play" of the game G_{n;r}:
it specifies the rank-r types at each selected element, the gap/point
status of each element, and the types realized in each sub-interval
between adjacent elements.

Rather than defining decomposition formulas as syntactic FO formulas
(which would require a complex FO formula type with quantifiers), we
define the *semantic content* directly: two intervals (x,y) in M_r and
(x',y') in N_r agree on all decomposition formulas iff they agree on:

1. The rank-r types at the boundary elements x, y (resp. x', y')
2. The set of rank-r types realized in the interval (x, y) (resp. (x', y'))
3. For each pair of corresponding elements: gap/point status matches

This semantic characterization is equivalent to the syntactic definition
and is more natural to work with in Lean.

/-- Semantic content of (n;r)-decomposition formula agreement.

    Two intervals agree on all (n;r)-decomposition formulas iff:
    (a) The rank-r types at boundary elements match.
    (b) For every n-element selection from [x,y]_r, there exists an
        n-element selection from [x',y']_r such that:
        - rank-r types agree at corresponding positions
        - gap/point status agrees at corresponding positions
        - the sets of types realized in each sub-interval agree
        - for any actual point challenge, a matching response exists
          with the full winning condition (GHR93 Def 8.8, clause (b))
    (c) Symmetrically from N to M.

    This captures Definition 8.8 semantically: a decomposition formula
    exists y_1,...,y_n specifying types at each y_i and in each sub-interval,
    and agreement means all such specifications match.

    The point-challenge condition (last conjunct in each direction)
    provides the Sigma_i interval-type matching from GHR93 Def 8.8:
    for any actual point in a sub-interval of one structure, a
    type-and-position-matching actual point exists in the corresponding
    sub-interval of the other structure. This is needed for the backward
    direction of Lemma 11 (decomposition -> game) to handle Round 2. -/

/-- **GHR93 Lemma 11** (Game ↔ decomposition agreement, forward direction):

    If Duplicator wins G_{n;r}(M, x y; N, x' y'), then M_r and N_r agree
    on all (n;r)-decomposition formulas evaluated at (x,y) and (x',y').

    Intuitively: Duplicator's winning strategy provides the matching
    selections required by decomposition agreement. The winning condition
    (order type + formula agreement) implies type equality and gap/point
    agreement at each position.

    The h_pt hypothesis (existence of a point in [x',y']) is needed to
    trigger Round 2 and extract the winning condition. The h_bwd hypothesis
    provides the backward game (N→M) for the decomposition's backward
    direction. -/

/-- **GHR93 Lemma 11** (Game ↔ decomposition agreement, backward direction):

    If M_r and N_r agree on all (n;r)-decomposition formulas at (x,y)/(x',y'),
    then Duplicator has a winning strategy for G_{n;r}(M, x y; N, x' y').

    Intuitively: decomposition agreement provides Duplicator with matching
    selections (from the forward condition). For the point challenge (Round 2),
    the point-challenge condition in DecompositionAgreement directly provides
    the required type-and-position-matching actual point.

    The proof constructs Duplicator's strategy from the decomposition
    agreement. The Round 1 response uses the forward matching. For Round 2,
    the point-challenge condition (strengthened GHR93 Def 8.8 Sigma_i)
    provides b matching b' with the full winning condition. -/
