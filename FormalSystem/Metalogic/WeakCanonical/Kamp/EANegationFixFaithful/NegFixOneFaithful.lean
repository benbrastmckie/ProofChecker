# Lemma 5.1 at one witness, at `VVecEA2` over the faithful carrier (Rabinovich, PDF pp.9-10)

Rabinovich proves Lemma 5.1 on PDF p.9 by an explicit **three-case** split, and the printed output
shape is `∨ᵢ (Condᵢ ∧ Formᵢ)`:

> *"We assume that `(z₀,z₁)` is non-empty. Hence, at least one of the following cases holds:*
> ***Case 1:** `¬α₀(z₀)` or `K⁺(¬β₁)(z₀)`.*
> ***Case 2:** `α₀(z₀)`, and `β₁` holds along `(z₀,z₁)`.*
> ***Case 3:** (1) `α₀(z₀) ∧ ¬K⁺(¬β₁)(z₀)`, and (2) there is `x ∈ (z₀,z₁)` such that `¬β₁(x)`.*
> *For each of these cases we construct a `∨∃⃗∀` formula `Condᵢ` that describes it … and show that
> if `Condᵢ` holds, then `¬[α₀,β₁…,β_{n-1},α_{n-1},βₙ,αₙ](z₀,z₁)` is equivalent to a `∨∃⃗∀` formula
> `Formᵢ`."*

For the one-witness bracket `bracketOne s0 p s1` (`EANegationFix/NegFixOne.lean:37`) the paper's
names instantiate as `α₀ = ⊤`, `β₁ = s0`, `α₁ = p`, `β₂ = s1`, `α₂ = ⊤`: the `α`'s are **point**
types (`α₀` at `z₀`, `α₁` at the interior witness, `α₂` at `z₁`) and the `β`'s are **segment**
types, exactly as PDF p.10's Figure 1 draws them. With `α₀ = ⊤` the first alternative of Case 1 is
unavailable, so Case 1 is `K⁺(¬s0)(z₀)` alone.

The three cases are the three outcomes of the faithful carrier read at `P := ¬β₁`, which is why
this module needs no case analysis of its own beyond the paper's:

| paper (PDF pp.9-10) | this module | carrier obligation |
|---|---|---|
| Case 2: `β₁` along `(z₀,z₁)` | `negFixOneCase2` | `¬β₁` does not occur — no `first_occ` call |
| Case 1: `K⁺(¬β₁)(z₀)` | `negFixOneCase1` | `HasFaithfulDedekindINF.first_occ`, **left** disjunct |
| Case 3: the `r₀` pin, eq (5.3) | `negFixOneCase3a/b/c` | `HasFaithfulDedekindINF.first_occ`, right |

and eq (5.3) of PDF p.10,

> `INF^{¬β₁}(z₀,z,z₁) := z₀ < z < z₁ ∧ (∀y)^{<z}_{>z₀} β₁(y) ∧ (¬β₁(z) ∨ K⁺(¬β₁)(z))`,

is eq (5.2) of PDF p.8 read at `P := ¬β₁` — the same formula the faithful carrier
`HasFaithfulDedekindINF` (`KPlusFaithful.lean:320`) is stated from. Its three conjuncts appear
here as: the `z₀ < r < z₁` of `VVecEA2.concatPin` (`VecEACombinators.lean:194`); the left block
`allSeg s0`; and the pin point type `infPinPoint s0`.

## The negation-chain discipline: which `K⁺` makes the split exhaustive

**Rabinovich's enumeration is exhaustive only at his own `K⁺`, and this module is now stated at
that one.** The enumeration quoted above (PDF p.9) is a *three*-case split with no slot for a
"`¬β₁` holds at `z₀`" case, and no slot for a "`¬β₁` fails at `z₀` but does not recur soon" case
either. Its exhaustiveness is not an accident of presentation: it is forced by the shape of the
infimum, and by the fact that `K⁺` in the source is **conjunct-free**.

Read the split at `P := ¬β₁`. Case 2 is *"`¬β₁` does not occur in `(z₀,z₁)` at all"*. If `¬β₁`
does occur, the paper's remaining alternatives are exactly *"the infimum of its occurrences sits
at `z₀`"* (Case 1) and *"the infimum is a point `r₀` strictly inside"* (Case 3). Rabinovich
states the second of these as a consequence of the first failing, and prints the implication
twice on PDF p.10 — once as the guard on the existence of `r₀`,

> *"When the first condition holds, then the second condition is equivalent to «there is (a
> unique) `r₀ ∈ (z₀,z₁)` such that `r₀ = inf{z ∈ (z₀,z₁) | ¬β₁(z)}`» (If `¬K⁺(¬β₁)` holds at `z₀`
> and there is `x ∈ (z₀,z₁)` such that `¬β₁(x)`, then such `r₀` exists because we deal with
> Dedekind complete chains.)"*

and once as the closed form of Case 3 itself,

> *"Hence, Case 3 is described by `α₀(z₀) ∧ ¬K⁺(¬β₁)(z₀) ∧ (∃z)^{<z₁}_{>z₀} INF^{¬β₁}(z₀,z,z₁)`
> which is equivalent to an `∃⃗∀` formula."*

Both printings say the same thing: *`¬K⁺(¬β₁)(z₀)` together with an occurrence of `¬β₁` inside
the interval yields the pin.* Contrapositively, an occurrence of `¬β₁` inside the interval yields
`K⁺(¬β₁)(z₀)` **or** the pin — a **dichotomy**, with the negation taken at `z₀`, which is
precisely where the predicate `¬β₁` is not asserted to fail. That is the negation-chain
discipline: the infimum is always taken where the predicate fails, and the `K⁺` guard is always
read at the left endpoint, never at the pin.

**Which `K⁺`.** Rabinovich's `K⁺`, Definition (3), PDF p.3 — *"`K⁺(F)` holds at a moment `t` iff
`t = inf({t′ | t′ > t and F holds at t′})`"* — and Reynolds' `K⁺A := ¬U(⊤,¬A)`, *"`A` will be
true arbitrarily soon"* (printed p.168), say **nothing about whether `F` holds at `t` itself**.
That is `kplusOpen` (`KPlusFaithful.lean:113`). This tree's `kplus` (`PriorINF.lean:86`) carries
an extra first conjunct `¬F(t)` that is **this tree's addition, not the sources'**.

**The tree's `kplus` would not make the split exhaustive**, and the failure is exactly at the
missing case: at a point where `¬β₁` holds at `z₀` *and* recurs arbitrarily soon above `z₀`, the
source's `K⁺(¬β₁)(z₀)` holds and Case 1 fires, while the tree's `kplus` fails at its first
conjunct, and the infimum is not strictly inside `(z₀,z₁)` either, so neither Case 1 nor Case 3
is available. A carrier stated at `kplus` must therefore print a *third* endpoint disjunct
`¬β₁(z₀)` — and that is literally the shape of `HasDenseDedekindINF`
(`DedekindINFDense.lean:222`), whose `first_occ` reads `P(z₀) ∨ kplus P z₀ ∨ (pin)`. The paper's
three-case enumeration has no slot for that first disjunct, so a trichotomy carrier would force a
proof branch Rabinovich never writes. `kplusOpen_not_implied_by_truth_at`
(`KPlusFaithful.lean:272`) exhibits the gap concretely — `P(t)` alone does not give
`kplusOpen P t` — so the two operators are genuinely different and the choice between them is not
cosmetic; and `hasFaithfulDedekindINF_survives_interval_witness` (`KPlusFaithful.lean:623`)
exhibits a structure where the faithful carrier holds and the `kplus`-stated one fails.

This is why `negFixOneFaithful_cover` below can be a two-arm `rcases` on
`HasFaithfulDedekindINF.first_occ` inside a carrier-free `by_cases` on occurrence, and needs no
endpoint branch: the cover's case structure **is** Rabinovich's, term for term, because the
carrier it reads is stated at the source's operator.

## Why this is not the six-disjunct attained list with the carriers swapped

`negFixOne` (`EANegationFix/NegFixOne.lean:90`) is a **six**-disjunct list `{A, B1, B2, B3, B4,
B4′}` that is not Rabinovich's case split: it is the tree's own formulation, and its cover
(`negFixOne_cover`, `EANegationFix/NegFixOne.lean:207`) pins four *attained* witnesses —

* `:224` the attained **first `p`-point**, via `HasAttainedINF.first_occ_tp p`;
* `:243` the attained **last `p`-point**, via `HasAttainedSUP.last_occ_tp p`;
* `:272` the attained **last `¬s1`-point**, via `HasAttainedSUP.last_occ_tp s1.neg`;
* `:276` the attained **first `¬s0`-point**, via `HasAttainedINF.first_occ_tp s0.neg`.

None of those four appears in Rabinovich's proof. The paper pins exactly one point, `r₀`, and it
is the eq (5.3) infimum of `¬β₁ = ¬s0` — the fourth site's predicate, but taken in the **INF**
(possibly-unattained) sense rather than the attained one. The other three sites have no
counterpart on pp.9-10 at all.

That is not merely a stylistic difference: `NegFixOneFaithfulGateProbe` below **machine-checks**
that the six-disjunct list is not a cover once attainment is dropped. On the `ℝ` structure it
builds, `bracketOne` fails on `(0,10)` and every one of the six disjuncts fails too, while the
faithful carrier's eq (5.2) obligation *is* dischargeable at the very predicate the attained cover
pins. So the six-disjunct list cannot be re-proved under a weaker carrier by any argument; a
faithful `n = 1` negation has to be the paper's case split, which is what is built here.

## What this costs in carrier strength

| | attained, `VBracketFormula` | faithful, `VVecEA2` (here) |
|---|---|---|
| shape | six gated disjuncts `{A,B1,B2,B3,B4,B4′}` | Rabinovich's `∨ᵢ (Condᵢ ∧ Formᵢ)`, three cases |
| pinned points | four, all attained | one, `r₀`, as eq (5.3) |
| carrier | `HasAttainedINF` **and** `HasAttainedSUP` | `HasFaithfulDedekindINF` **alone** |
| `K⁺` | n/a — attainment deletes the branch | the sources' conjunct-free `kplusOpen` |

Nothing in `EANegationFix/` is deleted, weakened, or edited. `negFixOne`, `negFixOne_cover`,
`negFixOne_iff` and the `ℤ` gate probe `NegFixGateProbe` all stay live and stay consumed
(`NfMultiAnchorBridge/Base.lean:1416` cites them); everything below is a pure addition, and the
attained carriers reach the faithful statement through `HasAttainedINF.toHasFaithfulDedekindINF`
(`KPlusFaithful.lean:382`).

**ADAPTED-FROM.** Every statement below previously bound `HasDedekindINF`
(`DedekindINF.lean:136`) and read the tree's `kplus` at the left endpoint. The one clause that
changed is the carrier and, with it, the endpoint operator: `HasDedekindINF →
HasFaithfulDedekindINF`, and `kplus`/`kplusPred`/`kplusLeftBlock` → `kplusOpen`/`kplusOpenPred`/
`kplusOpenLeftBlock` at the two places the endpoint operator is read (`negFixOneCase1` and the
eq (5.3) pin type `infPinPoint`). This is a **hypothesis weakening** — `HasDedekindINF` implies
`HasFaithfulDedekindINF` (`HasDedekindINF.toHasFaithfulDedekindINF`, `KPlusFaithful.lean:364`) —
so every previous supplier still supplies, and no conclusion was weakened to buy it. Not one
case of the cover was added, merged, or removed.

## Non-vacuity — what these statements exclude, and where the carrier is actually spent

1. **Nothing here re-introduces attainment.** The only carrier hypothesis in
   `negFixOneFaithful_cover`, `negFixOneFaithful_sound` and `negFixOneFaithful_iff` is
   `HasFaithfulDedekindINF`. `HasAttainedINF`, `HasAttainedSUP`, `HasDefinableINF` and
   `HasDefinableSUP` occur in **no** statement in this module except the deliberate `_of_attained`
   shim, whose entire content is that the attained hypothesis still reaches the faithful result.
   Checkable from the signatures, not merely asserted here.

2. **No SUP carrier is consumed, and this is a fact about Rabinovich's proof, not an
   omission.** The attained cover spends `HasAttainedSUP` twice (`:243`, `:272`). Rabinovich's
   Lemma 5.1 proof uses no `K⁻`, no supremum and no last-occurrence point anywhere on pp.9-10: its
   only pinned point is the eq (5.3) **infimum**, and its Case 2 discharges the whole `s1` side
   through Corollary 5.4(2), which `negBoundedLeftFixAnchoredFaithful_iff`
   (`BoundedFixAnchoredFaithful.lean`) proves under `HasFaithfulDedekindINF` alone. Stating an
   unused SUP hypothesis here would be a strengthening that buys nothing and hides what the
   proof costs.

3. **Where the faithful carrier's weak branch is genuinely taken.**
   `HasFaithfulDedekindINF.first_occ_tp` is called once, at `s0.neg`, and **both** of its
   disjuncts are live proof branches of `negFixOneFaithful_cover`: the left one —
   `kplusOpen M atomMap s0.neg.formula z0`, Rabinovich's Case 1 and the *Subcase `r₀ = z₀`* of
   PDF p.8 — produces `negFixOneCase1` and is the branch the attained carrier deletes outright;
   the right one produces the eq (5.3) pin of Cases 3a/3b/3c. The carrier is spent a second time
   inside `negFixOneTail_iff`, and there too the `K⁺` branch is on the invoked path (see
   `BoundedFixAnchoredFaithful.lean`'s non-vacuity note 2).

   **The unconditional wrapper `HasDedekindINF.first_occ_tp` is retained** beside its faithful
   counterpart, unweakened. The two are **incomparable**, not redundant: the old one assumes the
   stronger carrier and delivers the stronger `kplus` at `z₀`; the new one assumes the weaker
   carrier and delivers the weaker `kplusOpen`. Neither is derivable from the other, so deleting
   either would lose a statement. Nothing in this module calls the old one any more; it is kept
   for the consumers that still bind `HasDedekindINF`.

4. **The soundness direction needs the pin, not the carrier.** `bracketOne_witness_le_infPin` is
   the load-bearing step of `negFixOneFaithful_sound`, and it has **no** carrier hypothesis: the
   eq (5.3) point type `¬β₁(r) ∨ K⁺(¬β₁)(r)` is by itself enough to confine every bracket witness
   to `(z₀,r₀]`. This is the exact place where the possibly-unattained infimum does the work that
   the attained first `¬s0`-point does in `negFixOne_cover`.

5. **What is NOT claimed.** The `ℝ` probe below is not claimed to satisfy `HasFaithfulDedekindINF`
   (or `HasDedekindINF`) at every predicate — that would need a definability theorem about `ℝ`
   this tree does not have. What is proved is sharper and sufficient: at the predicate the
   attained cover pins, `ℝ` discharges the eq (5.2) obligation — in the `HasDedekindINF` shape,
   which implies the faithful one — and refutes the attained one, and the six-disjunct list
   fails there. As elsewhere in this stack, on Prior structures attainment holds outright, so no
   current consumer can distinguish the faithful carrier from the attained one.

    ADAPTED-FROM the `kplusPred` spelling this definition previously carried. The `K⁺` printed in

    would have made the disjunction `¬β₁(z) ∨ (¬β₁(z) ∧ …)` — i.e. silently collapse eq (5.3)'s
    second alternative into its first. The re-spelling removes that.

    Note this **weakens** the point type, hence weakens the Case 3 disjuncts: every consumer that
    supplied the old pin still supplies this one (`kplusOpen_of_kplus`, `KPlusFaithful.lean:212`),

/-! ## The three cases of PDF p.9, as `VVecEA2` disjuncts -/

/-- **Case 1** (PDF p.9): `K⁺(¬β₁)(z₀)`, with `Form₁ = True` — *"In this case
    `¬[α₀,β₁…,β_{n-1},α_{n-1},βₙ,αₙ](z₀,z₁)` is equivalent to True."*

    A pure left-endpoint condition, carried by `kplusOpenLeftBlock` (`Lemma53Faithful.lean:304`).
    The other alternative of the paper's Case 1, `¬α₀(z₀)`, is unavailable at `α₀ = ⊤`.

    ADAPTED-FROM the `kplusLeftBlock` spelling this definition previously carried. `K⁺` here is
    the one Rabinovich prints in Case 1 — his conjunct-free Definition (3), PDF p.3 — and it is
    exactly this choice that makes his three cases exhaustive without an endpoint branch; see the
    negation-chain discipline section in the module docstring. -/
noncomputable def negFixOneCase1 (s0 : TemporalPred) : VVecEA2 :=
  kplusOpenLeftBlock s0.neg

/-- **Case 2** (PDF p.10): `Cond₂ = β₁` along `(z₀,z₁)`, conjoined with `Form₂` = the anchored
    Cor 5.4(2). `Cond₂` rides in through `VVecEA2.conjEverywhere`. -/
noncomputable def negFixOneCase2 (s0 p s1 : TemporalPred) : VVecEA2 :=
  (negFixOneTail p s1).conjEverywhere s0

/-- **Case 3, arm (a)** (PDF p.10): the eq (5.3) pin `r₀`, with `β₂ = s1` failing somewhere
    strictly above it. Then no witness at all survives, because every witness is confined to
    `(z₀,r₀]` by `bracketOne_witness_le_infPin`. -/

/-- **Case 3, arm (b)** (PDF p.10): the eq (5.3) pin `r₀` carrying `¬α₁(r₀) ∧ ¬β₂(r₀)`, with `β₂`
    holding throughout `(r₀,z₁)`. The witness cannot be `r₀` itself (`¬α₁`), and cannot lie below
    `r₀` either, since `β₂` would then have to hold at `r₀`. -/

    on the *shrunken* interval `(z₀,r₀)`. This is the arm in which the paper's Case 3 recurses:
    the pin splits the interval and the negation is asked again to the left of it. -/

    formula equivalent to `¬ bracketOne s0 p s1` over `HasDedekindINF`.

    Rabinovich's `∨ᵢ (Condᵢ ∧ Formᵢ)` with `i` ranging over the paper's three cases, the third
    split into the three arms its pinned form requires. Compare `negFixOne`
    (`EANegationFix/NegFixOne.lean:90`), whose six disjuncts are a different formulation altogether
    and which `NegFixOneFaithfulGateProbe` shows cannot be a cover once attainment is dropped. -/

/-! ## The eq (5.3) pin confines every witness — carrier-free (PDF p.10) -/

/-- **The load-bearing step, and it needs no carrier.** If the eq (5.3) point type
    `¬β₁(r) ∨ K⁺(¬β₁)(r)` holds at `r`, then every `x` whose `β₁`-prefix condition is met
    satisfies `x ≤ r`.

    This is where the possibly-unattained infimum does the work that `negFixOne_cover`'s attained
    first `¬s0`-point does at `EANegationFix/NegFixOne.lean:276`. The `K⁺` alternative is handled
    by density rather than by a witness, which is exactly why no attainment is needed.

    Note that eq (5.3)'s *second* conjunct — `(∀y)^{<z}_{>z₀} β₁(y)`, the `allSeg s0` block of the
    Case 3 arms — is **not** used here: the pin's point type alone confines the witness. That
    conjunct is carried in the disjuncts because Rabinovich prints it (it is what makes `r₀` the
    infimum, and hence unique), not because this step needs it. -/

/-! ## The cover: Rabinovich's three cases are exhaustive (PDF pp.9-10) -/

/-- **Cover** (Rabinovich Lemma 5.1 at one witness, PDF pp.9-10): if `bracketOne s0 p s1` fails on
    a non-empty `(z₀,z₁)`, one of the paper's cases holds.

    The case split is not invented here: it is exactly the trichotomy *"`¬β₁` does not occur"* /
    *"`HasFaithfulDedekindINF.first_occ`'s left disjunct"* / *"its right disjunct"*, which is why
    the paper can assert *"at least one of the following cases holds"* over Dedekind complete
    chains and no fourth case is needed. The proof below is a carrier-free `by_cases` on
    occurrence (the paper's Case 2 against the rest) wrapping a **two-arm** `rcases` on the
    carrier (the paper's Case 1 against its Case 3), and the three arms of Case 3 are the paper's
    own pinned form, not extra cases.

    **The two-arm shape is the source's `K⁺` doing the work.** Under a carrier stated at the
    tree's `kplus` this same split would leave a gap — `¬β₁` holding at `z₀` and recurring
    arbitrarily soon — that Rabinovich's enumeration has no case for; the module docstring's
    negation-chain discipline section states the gap and why `kplusOpen` closes it.

    ADAPTED-FROM the `HasDedekindINF` binder this theorem previously carried. The carrier changed
    and Case 1's endpoint operator changed with it; **no case was added, merged, or removed**, and
    the proof's branch structure is unchanged.

    Compare `negFixOne_cover` (`EANegationFix/NegFixOne.lean:207`), which needs `HasAttainedINF`
    **and** `HasAttainedSUP` and pins four attained points. -/

/-! # The gate probe: the six-disjunct attained list is not a cover without attainment

`negFixOne`'s disjunct list `{A, B1, B2, B3, B4, B4′}` (`EANegationFix/NegFixOne.lean:90`) is a
biconditional cover **only** because `negFixOne_cover` may pin four attained points. The `ℤ` probe
`NegFixGateProbe` (`EANegationFix/NegFixOne.lean:402`) machine-checks that the two-point gated
shapes `B4`/`B4′` are unavoidable *given* attainment. This probe checks the complementary fact,
which is what decides the shape of the faithful `n = 1` negation: once attainment is dropped, the
six-disjunct list stops being a cover altogether, so no re-proof of it under a weaker carrier is
possible and the faithful version must be Rabinovich's own case split.

Take the carrier `ℝ` — a Dedekind complete chain — the interval `(0,10)`, and

* `β₂ = s1` false exactly on `(2,3)`,
* `β₁ = s0` false exactly on `(3,4)`,
* `α₁ = p`  true  exactly on `(2,3) ∪ {7}`.

Then `[s0, p, s1]` fails on `(0,10)`: a witness in `(2,3)` has a `¬s1`-point above it (inside
`(2,3)`), and the witness `7` has a `¬s0`-point below it (inside `(3,4)`). Yet every disjunct
fails too:

* `A = [¬p]` — refuted by `p 2.5`;
* `B1 = [¬p, (¬s0 ∧ ¬p), ⊤]` — every `¬s0`-point is `> 3`, and `p 2.5` breaks the `¬p` prefix;
* `B2 = [⊤, (¬s1 ∧ ¬p), ¬p]` — every `¬s1`-point lies in `(2,3)`, where `p` holds, so the pinned
  point's own `¬p` conjunct already fails;
* `B3 = [⊤, ¬s0, ⊤, ¬s1, ⊤]` — needs a `¬s0`-point strictly before a `¬s1`-point, i.e. some
  `w₀ ∈ (3,4)` below some `w₁ ∈ (2,3)`;
* `B4 = [⊤, (¬s1 ∧ ¬p), ¬p, (¬s0 ∧ ¬p), ⊤]` — fails at its first pinned point for `B2`'s reason;
* `B4′ = [⊤, (¬s0 ∧ ¬s1 ∧ ¬p), ⊤]` — needs one point in `(3,4) ∩ (2,3)`.

The two carrier facts below make the diagnosis exact rather than suggestive: at `p` on `(0,10)`
this structure **discharges** the faithful eq (5.2) obligation (with `r₀ = 2`, through the `K⁺`
alternative that `HasDedekindINF` admits and `HasDefinableINF` forbids) and **refutes** the
attained one. The failure is therefore located precisely at attainment, not at Dedekind
completeness.

What is *not* claimed: that this structure satisfies `HasDedekindINF` at every predicate. That
would need a definability theorem about `ℝ` which this tree does not have, and it is not needed —
the obligation is discharged at the predicate the attained cover actually pins. -/

/-- **The faithful carrier's obligation IS discharged here, at the pinned predicate.** This is

    eq (5.2) point is `r₀ = 2`, reached through the `K⁺(P)(r₀)` alternative — the alternative
    `HasDefinableINF` forbids (`hasDefinableINF_excludes_kplus`, `Lemma53.lean`) and
    `HasDedekindINF` admits.

    **This statement is left at the `HasDedekindINF` shape deliberately, and that is the stronger
    reading.** The module's carrier is now `HasFaithfulDedekindINF`, whose `first_occ` differs
    only in printing `kplusOpen` where this prints `kplus` in the **left** disjunct; the right
    disjunct is character-for-character the same, and `kplus → kplusOpen` (`kplusOpen_of_kplus`),
    so what is proved here implies the faithful carrier's obligation at `P := p` and the probe
    keeps its force. Weakening the statement to match the new carrier would have discarded a
    theorem to gain nothing. In any case the proof takes `Or.inr`, so the left disjunct is not
