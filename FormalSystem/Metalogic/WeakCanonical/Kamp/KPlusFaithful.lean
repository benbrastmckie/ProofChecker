# The source-exact `K⁺`, its missing bridge, and the faithful dichotomy carrier

This module lands the **Prop-level reading of `Formula.kPlus`** (`FormalSystem/Syntax/Formula.lean`
`:180`), the **bridge lemma relating the two** — absent from this tree since `Formula.kPlus` was
written — and the eq (5.2) first-occurrence carrier stated with the *sources'* `K⁺` rather than
this tree's `kplus`.

## Three spellings of `K⁺`, and which transcribes which source

This tree carries three, and the reader must keep them apart. The name-collision warning at
`Syntax/Formula.lean:164-179` names the first two; this module adds the third and, with the bridge
lemmas below, reduces the number of *unbridged* spellings from two to zero.

| Spelling | Level | Definition | Transcribes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Formula.kPlus` (`Syntax/Formula.lean:181`) | object | `(untl ⊤ φ.neg).neg` | **the sources, exactly** |
| `kplusOpen` (**this module**) | `Prop` | `∀ s > t, ∃ r ∈ (t,s), P(r)` | **the sources, exactly** — the semantic reading of `Formula.kPlus` |
| `kplus` (`Kamp/PriorINF.lean:86`) | `Prop` | `¬P(t) ∧ ∀ s > t, ∃ r ∈ (t,s), P(r)` | **neither source** — strictly stronger, by the added `¬P(t)` |
| `kplusFormula` (`Kamp/PriorINF.lean:~93`) | object | `P.neg ∧ ¬(⊤ U P.neg)` | the object-level spelling of `kplus`, not of the sources' `K⁺` |

The two source definitions, read verbatim from the corpus at this revision:

* **Rabinovich 2014**, *A Proof of Kamp's Theorem*, `K⁺` definition, **PDF p.3**:
  *"`K+(F)` (respectively, `K−(F)`) is an abbreviation for `¬((¬F)UntilTrue)` (respectively,
  `¬((¬F)SinceTrue)`)"*, and, spelled out semantically in the same passage,
  *"(3) `K+(F)` holds at a moment `t` iff `t = inf({t′ | t′ > t and F holds at t′})`."*
* **Reynolds 1992**, *An Axiomatization for Until and Since over the Reals without the IRR Rule*,
  abbreviation table, §1, **printed p.168**: `K⁺A` — *"for `¬U(⊤, ¬A)`"* — reading *"`A` will be
  true arbitrarily soon"*; with `U(A,B)(t)` iff *"there is `s > t` such that `A(s)` and for all
  `u`, if `t < u < s` then `B(u)`"*. Corroborated by Gabbay-Hodkinson-Reynolds 1994 §10.3.1
  (`K⁺q = ¬U(⊤,¬q)`), which `Syntax/Formula.lean:164-179` already cites.

**Neither source's `K⁺` carries a `¬A` conjunct at the point of evaluation.** Rabinovich's
`Until` takes its eventuality as the *second* argument, so his `(¬F) Until True` is Reynolds'
`U(⊤,¬F)` — the two abbreviations are the same operator written under mirrored argument
conventions, and `Formula.untl φ ψ` (`Table.lean:188`) follows Reynolds'.

## The bridge, and why its absence mattered

`Axiom.prior_U_gap` (`ProofSystem/Axioms.lean:377`), `Axiom.prior_S_gap` (`:387`) and `Axiom.sep`
(`:390`) are all stated with `Formula.kPlus` / `Formula.kMinus`, while the whole Prop-level carrier
apparatus — `kplus`, `HasDefinableINF`, `HasAttainedINF`, `HasDedekindINF`, `HasGuardedDedekindINF`,
`HasDenseDedekindINF` and the eight `*Faithful*` modules — is stated with `kplus`. Nothing in the
tree could read the axioms semantically, and nothing could move between the two spellings.
`kPlus_formula_correct` and `kMinus_formula_correct` below are that bridge, and they are
independently valuable to any later phase that must relate an axiom to a truth condition.

## The faithful carrier

`HasFaithfulDedekindINF` is `HasDedekindINF.first_occ` (`Kamp/DedekindINF.lean:136`)
character-for-character **except** that its left disjunct is `kplusOpen M atomMap P z₀` in place of
`kplus M atomMap P z₀`. That single change is the whole content of this module's carrier, and it is
what makes Rabinovich's *"`r₀ = z₀` iff `K⁺(P₁)(z₀)`"* (Lemma 5.3 Case 2, PDF p.8) a **definitional
restatement** — true verbatim under his own Definition (3) — rather than something requiring a
repair.

**What the carrier excludes** (honesty charter Rule 6). `HasFaithfulDedekindINF` forbids exactly
those structures in which some `P` occurs inside an interval `(z₀,z₁)` while *both*: `P` fails to
occur arbitrarily soon after `z₀`, *and* no eq (5.2) point exists inside `(z₀,z₁)`. On a densely
ordered flow this is a genuine restriction — but, unlike `HasDedekindINF`, it is **not** refuted by
a formula that holds at `z₀` and throughout `(z₀,z₁)`: see `kplusOpen_of_interval_witness` and
`hasFaithfulDedekindINF_survives_interval_witness` below, which are the machine-checked settlement
of that question. It admits the whole discrete/attained pipeline through
`HasDedekindINF.toHasFaithfulDedekindINF`, and it admits every dense structure satisfying
`SemanticPriorU` through `prior_hasFaithfulDedekindINF_dense`.

## What is read, not edited

`Syntax/Formula.lean`, `ProofSystem/Axioms.lean`, `Kamp/PriorINF.lean` (statements and proofs),
`Kamp/DedekindINF.lean`, `Kamp/Lemma53.lean`, `Kamp/DedekindINFDense.lean` (statements and proofs)
and all eight `*Faithful*` modules are **read** by this module and not edited by it. Nothing landed
by `DedekindINFDense.lean` is deleted, reverted, restated or deprecated: the guard/trichotomy
apparatus stays exactly as it is, it stays the tree's record of the `kplus` deviation, and
`HasFaithfulDedekindINF.toHasDenseDedekindINF` keeps it supplied.

/-! ## The source-exact `K⁺` at the `Prop` level -/

/-- **The sources' `K⁺`, at the `Prop` level**: `P` holds arbitrarily soon after `t`.

    Rabinovich 2014, `K⁺` definition, PDF p.3: *"`K+(F)` holds at a moment `t` iff
    `t = inf({t′ | t′ > t and F holds at t′})`"*. Reynolds 1992, abbreviation table §1, printed
    p.168: `K⁺A` for `¬U(⊤,¬A)`, *"`A` will be true arbitrarily soon"*.

    **This is `kplus` (`Kamp/PriorINF.lean:86`) minus its first conjunct**, and the first conjunct
    `¬P(t)` is **this tree's addition, not the sources'**. Neither Rabinovich's nor Reynolds'
    `K⁺` says anything about whether `P` holds at the point of evaluation. `kplus` is therefore
    strictly stronger than the operator both papers define; `kplusOpen` is what they define.

    `kplus_iff_not_and_kplusOpen` below states the exact relation, and
    `kplusOpen_not_implied_by_truth_at` exhibits a point at which `kplusOpen` fails while `P`
    holds, so the difference is not an artefact of presentation. -/
def kplusOpen {sig : MonadicSignature}
    (M : OrderedMonadicStructure sig) (atomMap : Formula → sig.preds)
    (P : Formula) (t : M.carrier) : Prop :=
  ∀ s : M.carrier, t < s → ∃ r : M.carrier, t < r ∧ r < s ∧ TemporalTruth M atomMap r P

/-- **The sources' `K⁻`, at the `Prop` level**: `P` held arbitrarily recently before `t`.

    The past mirror of `kplusOpen`. Rabinovich 2014, PDF p.3: *"(2) `K−(F)` holds at a moment `t`
    iff `t = sup({t′ | t′ < t and F holds at t′})`"*; Reynolds 1992, printed p.168: `K⁻A` for
    `¬S(⊤,¬A)`, *"`A` was true arbitrarily recently"*.

    **This is `kminus` (`Kamp/PriorINF.lean`) minus its first conjunct**, which is again this
    tree's addition and not the sources'. -/

/-! ## The missing bridge

`Formula.kPlus` (`Syntax/Formula.lean:181`) has stood in this tree, beside `kplusFormula`
(`Kamp/PriorINF.lean:~93`) and a name-collision warning, with **no lemma relating either to a
truth condition**. These two lemmas are that bridge. -/

/-- **The bridge: `Formula.kPlus` is `kplusOpen`.**

    `TemporalTruth M atomMap t (Formula.kPlus P) ↔ kplusOpen M atomMap P t`.

    `Formula.kPlus P` is `(untl P.neg ⊤).neg` (`Syntax/Formula.lean:181`), which is Reynolds'
    `¬U(⊤,¬P)` (abbreviation table §1, printed p.168) letter for letter under
    `Formula.untl`'s truth clause (`Table.lean:188`). Unwinding: `U(⊤,¬P)(t)` says some `(t,s)` is
    entirely `P`-free, so its negation says every `(t,s)` contains a point at which `P` holds —
    which is `kplusOpen`, and which is Rabinovich's Definition (3) (PDF p.3).

    **This is the lemma the tree has never had.** `Axiom.prior_U_gap`
    (`ProofSystem/Axioms.lean:377`) and `Axiom.sep` (`:390`) are stated with `Formula.kPlus`;
    before this lemma nothing in the tree could read their `K⁺` semantically. -/

    `Formula.kMinus P` is `(snce P.neg ⊤).neg` (`Syntax/Formula.lean:193`), Reynolds' `¬S(⊤,¬P)`
    (printed p.168). `Axiom.prior_S_gap` (`ProofSystem/Axioms.lean:387`) and `Axiom.sep` (`:390`)

/-! ## Relating the two `Prop`-level spellings

The relation is exactly one conjunct, in one direction only. These lemmas make the trichotomy's
weakness precise rather than asserted. -/

/-- **`kplus` is `kplusOpen` plus this tree's extra conjunct**, definitionally.

    Reading right to left: to get the tree's `kplus` from the sources' `K⁺` one must *add*
    `¬P(t)`, which neither source's definition contains. -/

/-! ### The converse fails, machine-checked

`truth_or_kplus_of_kplusOpen` has no converse: `P(t)` alone does **not** give `kplusOpen P t`.
The witness below is what makes the trichotomy's third disjunct *uninformative* — a consumer that
lands in `P(z₀)` learns nothing about whether the first occurrence sits at `z₀` — and it is
simultaneously the reason `HasDenseDedekindINF → HasFaithfulDedekindINF` is unavailable. -/

/-- **The closed left ray**: the real line with one predicate true exactly on `(-∞,0]`.

    Original scaffolding for the witness below; the sibling of Phase 9's `denseRayFlow` and
    `denseWindowFlow` (`PriorDefsDense.lean`) with a *closed* endpoint, which is exactly what
    separates "`P` holds here" from "`P` holds arbitrarily soon after here". -/
noncomputable abbrev denseClosedRayFlow : OrderedMonadicStructure densePriorSig :=
  realFlowStructure (fun x => x ≤ 0)

/-- **`P(t)` does not imply `kplusOpen P t`**: on the closed left ray at `t = 0` the predicate
    holds, and yet it holds nowhere in `(0,1)`.

    Consequences, both load-bearing:
    * `truth_or_kplus_of_kplusOpen` is a strict one-way implication, so the trichotomy
      `HasDenseDedekindINF` (`DedekindINFDense.lean:187`) is **strictly weaker at the left
      disjunct** than the dichotomy `HasFaithfulDedekindINF` below.
    * `HasDenseDedekindINF → HasFaithfulDedekindINF` is **not** available and is not attempted
      here: a consumer handed the trichotomy's `P(z₀)` disjunct cannot recover `kplusOpen P z₀`,
      because `P(z₀)` does not imply that `P` recurs above `z₀` at all. The shim lattice below
      therefore runs one way only. -/

/-! ## The faithful dichotomy carrier

Rabinovich 2014, Lemma 5.3 Case 2 and eq (5.2), PDF p.8:

> *"Case 2: If case 1 does not hold then let `r₀ = inf{z ∈ (z₀, z₁) | P₁(z)}` … Note that
> `r₀ = z₀` iff `K⁺(P₁)(z₀)`. If `r₀ > z₀` then `r₀ ∈ (z₀, z₁)` and `r₀` is definable by the
> following ∨∃⃗∀ formula:"* then
> `INF(z₀,r₀,z₁,P₁) := z₀ < r₀ < z₁ ∧ (∀y)^{<r₀}_{>z₀} ¬P₁(y) ∧ (P₁(r₀) ∨ K⁺(P₁)(r₀))` **(5.2)**.

Under Rabinovich's own Definition (3) — *"`K+(F)` holds at `t` iff
`t = inf({t′ | t′ > t and F holds at t′})`"*, PDF p.3 — the quoted biconditional
*"`r₀ = z₀` iff `K⁺(P₁)(z₀)`"* is a **definitional restatement**, true verbatim. The carriers
below are that dichotomy, stated at the source's `K⁺`. -/

/-- **Rabinovich's eq (5.2) carrier at the *source's* `K⁺`** (Lemma 5.3 Case 2, PDF p.8, with
    `K⁺` per his Definition (3), PDF p.3; Reynolds' abbreviation table, printed p.168).

    `HasDedekindINF.first_occ` (`Kamp/DedekindINF.lean:136`) character-for-character **except**
    that the left disjunct is `kplusOpen M atomMap P z₀` in place of `kplus M atomMap P z₀`. The
    right disjunct is literally `HasDedekindINF`'s, `kplus` included: `P(r₀) ∨ kplusOpen P r₀` and
    `P(r₀) ∨ kplus P r₀` are interderivable *as disjunctions* (`truth_or_kplus_of_kplusOpen` one
    way, `kplusOpen_of_kplus` the other), so nothing is gained or lost by changing it and the two
    carriers' right disjuncts stay syntactically identical for the re-base.

    **This is a dichotomy, not a trichotomy.** No endpoint guard and no third disjunct: the left
    disjunct at the source's `K⁺` already covers Rabinovich's `r₀ = z₀` subcase *whether or not*
    `P` holds at `z₀`, which is precisely what this tree's `kplus` could not express.

    **What it excludes** (honesty charter Rule 6). It forbids exactly those structures carrying a
    `P` and an interval `(z₀,z₁)` in which `P` occurs, such that `P` does *not* occur arbitrarily
    soon after `z₀` and no eq (5.2) point lies inside `(z₀,z₁)`. It **admits**: the whole
    discrete/attained pipeline (`HasDedekindINF.toHasFaithfulDedekindINF`, composed with
    `HasAttainedINF.toHasDedekindINF` and `HasDefinableINF.toHasDedekindINF`); every dense
    structure satisfying `SemanticPriorU` (`prior_hasFaithfulDedekindINF_dense`); and — unlike
    `HasDedekindINF` — the dense-window configuration at which
    `hasDedekindINF_fails_on_dense_window` refutes the tree's carrier

/-! ## The shim lattice

The faithful carrier is a **weakening** of `HasDedekindINF`, so every current supplier keeps
working, and it is a **strengthening** of Phase 10's trichotomy at the left disjunct, so Phase 10's
landed carrier stays supplied. The lattice runs one way at each edge; the missing edge is recorded
below with its reason. -/

/-- `HasDedekindINF` implies the faithful carrier: the left disjunct's extra conjunct is
    discarded (`kplusOpen_of_kplus`), the right disjunct is passed through unchanged.

    **This is the edge that keeps the discrete pipeline supplied.** Composed with
    `HasAttainedINF.toHasDedekindINF` (`DedekindINF.lean:172`) and
    `HasDefinableINF.toHasDedekindINF` (`:185`), everything that supplies a first-occurrence
    carrier today supplies this one. -/

/-! ### The edge that does not exist

**`HasDenseDedekindINF → HasFaithfulDedekindINF` is not available**, and no attempt at it is made
here. A consumer handed the trichotomy's third disjunct `P(z₀)` cannot recover
`kplusOpen M atomMap P z₀`, because `P(z₀)` does not imply that `P` recurs above `z₀` at all —
`kplusOpen_not_implied_by_truth_at` exhibits the point. This is the precise sense in which the
trichotomy's endpoint disjunct is *uninformative*: it does not say `r₀ = z₀`, so a consumer that
lands in it learns nothing it can use, which is why the two hard re-base sites have no case slot
for it. The lattice is therefore strictly one-way at this edge, and the faithful dichotomy is the
stronger of the two carriers at the left disjunct while being weaker than `HasDedekindINF`. -/

/-! ## The derivation from the dense Prior hypotheses, with no guard

Reynolds 1992, Prior-U / Prior-S, printed p.168, instantiated at `p := ¬P`. The case split is on
the **interval**, never on `z₀`, which is why no guard appears anywhere below. -/

/-- **`SemanticPriorU` yields the faithful eq (5.2) dichotomy, hypothesis-free**
    (Rabinovich 2014, Lemma 5.3 Case 2 and eq (5.2), PDF p.8; derived from Reynolds 1992,
    Prior-U, printed p.168).

    The derivation, following the paper's Case 2 at the paper's own `K⁺`:

    1. If `K⁺(P)(z₀)` — i.e. `kplusOpen M atomMap P z₀` — take the left disjunct and stop. This is
       Rabinovich's *"Subcase `r₀ = z₀`"* (PDF p.8), and at his `K⁺` it needs no side condition.
    2. Otherwise some `(z₀,s)` is entirely `P`-free. That is Prior-U's first antecedent
       `U(⊤,¬P)(z₀)`, obtained **directly from the failure of `kplusOpen`** — no `¬P(z₀)` is
       needed, because `kplusOpen` says nothing about `z₀`.
    3. `P` occurs inside `(z₀,z₁)`, which is Prior-U's second antecedent `F¬¬P(z₀)`.
    4. Prior-U's conclusion `U(P ∨ K⁺(P), ¬P)(z₀)` supplies `r₀ > z₀` with `¬P` throughout
       `(z₀,r₀)` and `P(r₀) ∨ K⁺(P)(r₀)`.
    5. `r₀ < z₁`, because `P` occurs at some `x ∈ (z₀,z₁)` while `¬P` holds on `(z₀,r₀)`.
    6. Steps 4-5 are eq (5.2) verbatim — the right disjunct.

    **Compare `prior_hasGuardedDedekindINF_dense` (`DedekindINFDense.lean:326`)**, which needs the
    endpoint guard `¬P(z₀)` at step 2 precisely because the failure of the tree's `kplus` might be
    in its *first* conjunct rather than its second. At the source's `K⁺` there is no first
    conjunct, so there is nothing to guard. The two derivations are otherwise the same proof.

    No discreteness, no attainment, no completeness hypothesis on the flow: `SemanticPriorU`
    alone, exactly as at Phase 10. -/

/-! ## THE PROBE: does the interval-witness refutation survive the conjunct-free antecedent?

`hasDedekindINF_fails_of_interval_witness` (`DedekindINFDense.lean:455`) refutes `HasDedekindINF`
on any densely ordered flow carrying a formula that holds at `z₀` **and** throughout `(z₀,z₁)`.
Its left-disjunct arm is `exact h_left.1 h_at` — it kills `kplus`'s **first conjunct**, the one
neither source has. The question this section settles by machine is whether the refutation still
goes through when that conjunct is removed. -/

/-- **The refutation's own hypotheses *establish* the faithful left disjunct.**

    If the flow is densely ordered and `P` holds throughout `(z₀,z₁)`, then `P` holds arbitrarily
    soon after `z₀` — which is `kplusOpen M atomMap P z₀`, the sources' `K⁺`.

    Note what is **not** assumed: `TemporalTruth M atomMap z₀ P` plays no role. The very
    configuration that makes `hasDedekindINF_fails_of_interval_witness` fire is a configuration in
    which the source-exact left disjunct holds outright. -/

/-- **THE PROBE, stated head to head.** Under *exactly* the hypotheses of
    `hasDedekindINF_fails_of_interval_witness` (`DedekindINFDense.lean:455`) — a densely ordered
    flow, `P` at `z₀`, `P` throughout `(z₀,z₁)` — the tree's carrier `HasDedekindINF` is refuted
    while the source-exact carrier's **left disjunct holds**.

    **So the refutation does not survive the conjunct-free antecedent.** The interval-witness
    refutation is a theorem about the extra `¬P(z₀)` conjunct that `kplus`
    (`Kamp/PriorINF.lean:86`) carries and that neither Rabinovich's nor Reynolds' `K⁺` has. Under
    the sources' `K⁺` there is no failure to refute: `P` is true arbitrarily soon after `z₀`, so
    the paper's `Subcase r₀ = z₀` fires and eq (5.2) is never needed.

    **Consequence, machine-checked rather than argued**: the endpoint guard
    (`HasGuardedDedekindINF`), the third disjunct `P(z₀)` and the trichotomy
    (`HasDenseDedekindINF`) are a formalization-level repair for this tree's `kplus`. They have no
    counterpart in either source, and a carrier stated at the source's `K⁺` does not need them.
    They stay landed, unedited, and supplied by `HasFaithfulDedekindINF.toHasDenseDedekindINF`. -/
