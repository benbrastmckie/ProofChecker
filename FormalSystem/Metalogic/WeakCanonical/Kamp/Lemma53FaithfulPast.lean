# The `HasFaithfulDedekindSUP` / Since mirror of the eq (5.2) primitives (Rabinovich, PDF p.8)

`Lemma53Faithful.lean` restores Rabinovich's printed three-disjunct `Oₙ₊₁` over the faithful
`HasFaithfulDedekindINF` carrier (`KPlusFaithful.lean:320`). That module is entirely
**future/Until-directed**: it peels the *first* point type off the chain and pins it at the
first-occurrence infimum. This module supplies the **past/Since-directed** primitives, which the
tree did not have at all: `kminus` (`PriorINF.lean`) was declared with **no object-language
spelling and no correctness lemma anywhere**, so the `HasDedekindSUP` carrier
(`DedekindINF.lean:153`) could be stated but none of its content could be used.

Cite Rabinovich by **PDF page only**:
`~/Projects/Literature/sources/rabinovich_2014/Rabinovich_2014_Proof_of_Kamps_Theorem.pdf`.
The companion `.md` conversion is corrupt (it drops the displayed equations — and Lemma 5.3 *is*
displayed equations — and inverts `k ≠ m` to `k = m`) and is never ground truth.

## Source correspondence: PDF p.8, mirrored

p.8 prints only the future direction. Its Case 2 reads:

> *"let `r₀ = inf{z ∈ (z₀,z₁) | P₁(z)}` (such `r₀` exists by Dedekind completeness). Note that
> `r₀ = z₀` iff `K⁺(P₁)(z₀)`. If `r₀ > z₀` then `r₀ ∈ (z₀,z₁)` and `r₀` is definable by the
> following `∨∃⃗∀` formula:"*
> `INF(z₀,r₀,z₁,P₁) := z₀ < r₀ < z₁ ∧ (∀y)^{<r₀}_{>z₀}¬P₁(y) ∧ (P₁(r₀) ∨ K⁺(P₁)(r₀))`  (5.2)

The mirror replaces `inf` by `sup{z ∈ (z₀,z₁) | Pₙ(z)}`, the boundary subcase `r₀ = z₀` by
`r₀ = z₁` (equivalently `K⁻(Pₙ)(z₁)`), and the `(∀y)^{<r₀}_{>z₀}` block by `(∀y)^{<z₁}_{>r₀}`.
This is the Until/Since symmetry the paper itself relies on: p.8 proves the `Until` instance and
Corollary 5.4 immediately takes both directions. **No hypothesis absent from p.8 is introduced.**
In particular `K⁻` needs nothing new: `Formula.snce` interprets Since natively
(`Table.lean:198`), so `kminusFormula` below is the literal transcription of `¬P ∧ ¬(⊤ S ¬P)`,
exactly as `kplusFormula` (`PriorINF.lean:93`) is `¬P ∧ ¬(⊤ U ¬P)`.

## What this module lands

* `kminusFormula` / `kminus_formula_correct` — `K⁻(P)` as an object-language formula, with the
  correctness lemma that was missing. Mirrors `kplusFormula` / `kplus_formula_correct`
  (`Lemma53.lean:162`).
* `kminusPred` / `kminusPred_eval` — the same at `TemporalPred` level; mirrors
  `kplusPred` / `kplusPred_eval` (`Lemma53Faithful.lean:81`, `:83`).
* `kminusOpenPred` / `kminusOpenPred_eval` — the **sources'** `K⁻` at `TemporalPred` level, on
  `Formula.kMinus` (`Syntax/Formula.lean:193`); mirrors `kplusOpenPred` / `kplusOpenPred_eval`.
* `HasDedekindSUP.last_occ_tp` and `HasFaithfulDedekindSUP.last_occ_tp` — the `TemporalPred`-level
  wrappers of the two past carriers, following the pattern of `HasAttainedSUP.last_occ_tp`
  (`EANegationFix/BoundedFix.lean:72`) and `HasAttainedINF.first_occ_tp`
  (`EANegationClosure.lean`).
* `orderedPointsExist_combine_right` — the right-end mirror of `orderedPointsExist_combine`
  (`EANegationFix/OnBuilder.lean:95`), which only ever combined at the left end.
* `orderedPointsExist_combine_kminusOpen` / `orderedPointsExist_combine_kminus` /
  `orderedPointsExist_widen_right` — the duals of `orderedPointsExist_combine_kplusOpen` /
  `orderedPointsExist_combine_kplus` / `orderedPointsExist_widen_left`
  (`Lemma53Faithful.lean`).
* `HasAttainedSUP.toHasDefinableSUP`, `hasDefinableSUP_excludes_kminus`,
  `prior_makes_faithful_kminus_disjunct_unreachable`, `prior_makes_kminus_disjunct_unreachable` —
  the SUP-side exclusion route at both `K⁻` spellings, mirroring
  `HasAttainedINF.toHasDefinableINF` (`PriorINF.lean:221`), `hasDefinableINF_excludes_kplus`
  (`Lemma53.lean:290`) and the two INF-side exclusion theorems in `Lemma53Faithful.lean`.

## ADAPTED-FROM: this module previously supplied only the `HasDedekindSUP` spelling

**What changed, in one clause**: the boundary disjunct `K⁻(Pₙ)(z₁)` gained a second, source-exact
spelling — `kminusOpen` (`KPlusFaithful.lean:126`), on `Formula.kMinus` — beside the tree's
`kminus` (`PriorINF.lean`), which carries an extra `¬P(z₁)` conjunct that neither Rabinovich
2014 (`K⁻` Definition (2), PDF p.3) nor Reynolds 1992 (abbreviation table §1, printed p.168:
`K⁻A` for `¬S(⊤,¬A)`) states.

**The re-base is additive at `last_occ_tp`, not in place, and this is deliberate.**
`HasDedekindSUP.last_occ_tp`'s conclusion carries `kminus P z₁`; the faithful carrier can only
supply `kminusOpen P z₁`, and `kminusOpen ↛ kminus`. So an in-place re-base of that wrapper would
strictly *weaken* a landed conclusion. Both wrappers are therefore kept: neither subsumes the
other (weaker hypothesis, weaker conclusion), and no landed statement moves. The `combine` and
exclusion primitives, where the two spellings *are* interderivable in the direction used, are
re-based in place with the `kminus` versions derived from the `kminusOpen` ones.

Nothing here deletes or weakens any landed declaration. Every declaration is an addition or a
same-statement re-derivation, and the attained-carrier stack in `EANegationFix/` reaches the past
carriers through the landed shims `HasAttainedSUP.toHasDedekindSUP` (`DedekindINF.lean:200`) and
`HasAttainedSUP.toHasFaithfulDedekindSUP` (`KPlusFaithful.lean:388`).

## What this carrier EXCLUDES — read this before citing anything below

Extended non-vacuity rule: *every module that lands or weakens a carrier must state what that
carrier excludes.* An over-strong hypothesis passes sorry-free, axiom-clean and EXIT 0 exactly as
a vacuous conclusion does. Mirroring the three statements made in `Lemma53Faithful.lean`:

1. **`HasDedekindSUP` excludes** chains on which a last occurrence of `P` in `(z₀,z₁)` has a
   supremum that is none of the mirrored eq (5.2) shapes: the supremum `r₀` must satisfy
   `r₀ = z₁` (equivalently `K⁻(P)(z₁)`), or `r₀ ∈ (z₀,z₁)` with `¬P` on `(r₀,z₁)` and
   `P(r₀) ∨ K⁻(P)(r₀)`. Bare Dedekind completeness supplies the supremum's *existence* only;
   `HasDedekindSUP` additionally asserts it is **TL-definable** in one of those shapes. The
   strengthening chain mirrors the INF side exactly:
   `Rabinovich's Dedekind completeness < HasDedekindSUP < HasDefinableSUP < HasAttainedSUP`.
   So this carrier is still strictly stronger than the paper's hypothesis, only much less so.
   `HasFaithfulDedekindSUP` (`KPlusFaithful.lean:339`) sits one link below `HasDedekindSUP` on
   that chain, and its own exclusion statement is at `KPlusFaithful.lean:333-338`.
2. **The `K⁻` boundary disjunct is provably dead on every Prior structure, at BOTH `K⁻`
   spellings.** `prior_makes_faithful_kminus_disjunct_unreachable` below proves it for the
   sources' `K⁻`, and `prior_makes_kminus_disjunct_unreachable` — kept, and now derived from it —
   for the tree's `kminus`: `SemanticPriorSZ` gives `HasAttainedSUP` (`PriorINF.lean:275`), whose
   attained last occurrence `r₀ < z₁` with `¬P` on `(r₀,z₁)` collides with `K⁻` asserting that
   `P` occurs in every interval below `z₁`. This is the exact mirror of what the two INF-side
   exclusion theorems establish for `K⁺(P)(z₀)`.

   **Weakening the boundary disjunct's spelling did not resurrect it** — the same live risk the
   INF side records, resolved the same way: attainment kills `kminusOpen P z₁` outright, and the
   tree's extra `¬P(z₁)` conjunct is never read in the argument.
3. **The past mirror is therefore NOT observable by any current consumer.** The live goal chain
   in this tree runs on Prior structures, where SUP attainment holds outright from the SZ axiom,
   so no live consumer can tell `HasAttainedSUP` and `HasDedekindSUP` apart — the same reason,
   and the same honest limitation, as the INF direction. Observability arrives only with a
   genuinely non-attained Dedekind-complete frame class, which this tree does not construct
   (`DedekindINF.lean:49-50` states that absence explicitly).
   `hasDedekindINF_admits_kplus_shape` (`DedekindINF.lean:264`) must **not** be cited against
   this: its proof is `Or.inl h_kplus` and its own docstring admits it exhibits no structure.

/-! ## `K⁻(P)` as an object-language formula

`kminus` (`PriorINF.lean`) was declared semantically and never given a spelling. `Formula.snce`
interprets Since natively (`Table.lean:198`): `snce φ ψ` at `t` is
`∃s < t, φ(s) ∧ ∀r ∈ (s,t), ψ(r)`. So `⊤ S ¬P` at `t` reads *"there is a gap below `t` on which
`P` never holds"*, and its negation is *"`P` occurs in every interval `(s,t)`"* — which, conjoined
with `¬P(t)`, is exactly `K⁻(P)(t)`. -/

/-- `K⁻(P)` is TL-definable: the formula `P.neg ∧ ¬(⊤ S P.neg)`.

    Exact mirror of `kplusFormula` (`PriorINF.lean:93`), with `Formula.untl` replaced by
    `Formula.snce`.

    Source correspondence: PDF p.8, mirrored — `K⁺(P₁)(z₀)` is asserted there to be *"an atomic
    (and hence a `∨∃⃗∀`) formula in the canonical expansion"*; this tree needs no canonical
    expansion in either direction, since both operators are outright TL-definable. -/
noncomputable def kminusFormula (P : Formula) : Formula :=
  Formula.and P.neg (Formula.imp (Formula.snce P.neg Formula.top) Formula.bot)

/-- `kminusFormula P` defines `K⁻(P)` in the object language: its truth at `t` is exactly the
    semantic `kminus M atomMap P t`.

    This is the missing correctness lemma — `kminus` had none, so the `HasDedekindSUP` carrier
    could be stated but its left disjunct could not be used as syntax. Structural dual of
    `kplus_formula_correct` (`Lemma53.lean:162`); no step of that proof needed adaptation beyond
    reversing the order comparisons.

    ADAPTED-FROM `HasDedekindSUP.last_occ_tp` above. What changed: the carrier binder, and with it

    unconditional `rcases`-and-repackage, so the wrapper's **two-arm shape is unchanged**; only

/-! ## Extended non-vacuity: the SUP-side exclusion, machine-checked

The INF side records its exclusion as `hasDefinableINF_excludes_kplus` (`Lemma53.lean:290`) and
`prior_makes_disjunct2_unreachable` (`Lemma53Faithful.lean:382`). The SUP side had **neither**:
`HasAttainedSUP.toHasDefinableSUP` and the `kminus` exclusion did not exist. Both are supplied
here so the exclusion statement in this module's docstring is machine-checked rather than
asserted. -/

/-- `HasAttainedSUP` implies `HasDefinableSUP`. Mirror of `HasAttainedINF.toHasDefinableINF`
    (`PriorINF.lean:221`); the attained last occurrence is the `P(r₀)` alternative of the
    disjunctive point condition, and `z₀ < r₀` weakens to `z₀ ≤ r₀`. -/

/-- **`HasDefinableSUP` is not the mirrored eq (5.2) carrier: it silently deletes the `K⁻`
    boundary disjunct.**

    Mirror of `hasDefinableINF_excludes_kplus` (`Lemma53.lean:290`). Assuming `HasDefinableSUP`
    makes `K⁻(P)(z₁)` *unreachable* whenever `P` occurs in `(z₀,z₁)` — which is exactly the
    mirrored `Subcase r₀ = z₁`. The proof is immediate: `last_occ` hands back an `r₀ < z₁` with
    `¬P` throughout `(r₀,z₁)`, while `K⁻(P)(z₁)` says `P` occurs in *every* interval below `z₁`;
    instantiate the latter at `r₀` and the two collide.

/-- **On Prior structures, the `K⁻` boundary disjunct is unreachable — at the SOURCES' `K⁻`.**

    `SemanticPriorSZ` gives `HasAttainedSUP` (`prior_hasAttainedSUP`, `PriorINF.lean:275`), whose
    `last_occ` hands back an attained `r₀ < z₁` with `¬P` throughout `(r₀,z₁)`. The sources' `K⁻`
    says `P` occurs in *every* interval `(s,z₁)`; instantiate it at `s := r₀` and the two collide.
    No use is made of the tree's extra `¬P(z₁)` conjunct, which is why the weaker boundary
    spelling is dead for the same reason the stronger one is.

    Consequence, stated honestly: the mirrored boundary case can only ever fire on a structure
    that is **not** a Prior structure. No such structure is constructed anywhere in this tree, so
    the faithful past carrier is **not observable by any current consumer** — it becomes
    observable only once a genuinely non-attained Dedekind-complete frame class is built. This is
    the exact mirror of `prior_makes_faithful_disjunct2_unreachable` (`Lemma53Faithful.lean`),
    and it fails for exactly the same reason.
