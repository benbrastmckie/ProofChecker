# Abstract INF Hypothesis and Prior Instantiation

Defines the abstract first/last-occurrence hypotheses `HasDefinableINF` and
`HasDefinableSUP`, following Rabinovich 2014 Section 5. These capture the
property that for any TL-definable predicate, first (resp. last) occurrences
in an interval are "definable" in a sense adequate for the negation closure
argument.

## Abstract Hypotheses

The key property needed for Rabinovich's negation closure (Lemma 5.1) is:
given a TL-definable predicate P and an interval (z0, z1), if P occurs
somewhere in (z0, z1), then there exists a "definable infimum point" r0
near the first occurrence satisfying:
- z0 < r0 <= z1
- P does not hold in (z0, r0) (or more precisely, in the open interval)
- Either P(r0) holds (attained infimum) or K+(P)(r0) holds (P holds
  arbitrarily close from above)

where K+(P) is the "holds arbitrarily soon after" operator, TL-definable
as ¬(⊤ U ¬P) ∧ ¬P (i.e., P is dense to the right but does not hold at
the point itself). See Rabinovich eq 5.2.

## Prior Instantiation

For Prior structures (satisfying `SemanticPriorUZ`), first occurrences
are attained: the UZ axiom directly gives a point where P holds, with ¬P
between the current point and that first occurrence. The P(r0) disjunct
holds outright, and the K+ disjunct is vacuous.

/-! ## `kplus` — this tree's operator, and how it differs from the sources' `K⁺`

**This section's operator is NOT Reynolds' or Rabinovich's `K⁺`.** It is strictly stronger, by
one added conjunct. The doubt recorded in earlier drafts of this comment block — *"the Rabinovich
paper uses the notation differently"* — was correct, and is resolved here.

**What the sources define**, read verbatim from the corpus:

* Rabinovich 2014, `K⁺` definition, PDF p.3: *"`K+(F)` (respectively, `K−(F)`) is an abbreviation
  for `¬((¬F)UntilTrue)` (respectively, `¬((¬F)SinceTrue)`)"*, and semantically in the same
  passage: *"(3) `K+(F)` holds at a moment `t` iff `t = inf({t′ | t′ > t and F holds at t′})`"*
  (and *"(2) `K−(F)` holds at a moment `t` iff `t = sup({t′ | t′ < t and F holds at t′})`"*).
* Reynolds 1992, abbreviation table §1, printed p.168: `K⁺A` — *"for `¬U(⊤, ¬A)`"* — reading
  *"`A` will be true arbitrarily soon"*; `K⁻A` for `¬S(⊤,¬A)`. Corroborated by
  Gabbay-Hodkinson-Reynolds 1994 §10.3.1 (`K⁺q = ¬U(⊤,¬q)`).

Rabinovich's `Until` takes its eventuality as the *second* argument, so his `(¬F) Until True` is
Reynolds' `U(⊤,¬F)`: the two abbreviations are the same operator under mirrored argument
conventions. **Neither carries a `¬F` conjunct at the point of evaluation.**

**Where the source-exact spellings live in this tree:**

* `Formula.kPlus` / `Formula.kMinus` (`FormalSystem/Syntax/Formula.lean:180`, `:193`) — the
  object-level source-exact spelling, `(untl ⊤ φ.neg).neg`, carrying the **name-collision
  warning at `Formula.lean:163-179`** which says of `kplusFormula` below that *"substituting one
  for the other silently transcribes a different axiom"*. `Axiom.prior_U_gap`
  (`ProofSystem/Axioms.lean:377`), `Axiom.prior_S_gap` (`:387`) and `Axiom.sep` (`:390`) are
  stated with these.
* `kplusOpen` / `kminusOpen` (`Kamp/KPlusFaithful.lean`) — their `Prop`-level reading, together
  with the bridge lemmas `kPlus_formula_correct` / `kMinus_formula_correct`. `kplusOpen` is
  exactly `kplus` below **without** its first conjunct, and
  `kplus_iff_not_and_kplusOpen` states the relation.

**What `kplus` below is.** The unwinding recorded in earlier drafts of this comment is correct as
arithmetic and is retained: `(⊤ U ¬P)(t) = ∃ s > t, ∀ r ∈ (t,s), ¬P(r)` — a *gap* in `P` above
`t`, not `F(¬P)` — so `¬(⊤ U ¬P)(t) = ∀ s > t, ∃ r ∈ (t,s), P(r)`, "`P` is dense above `t`".
That last formula **is** the sources' `K⁺`. `kplus` conjoins `¬P(t)` to it. The extra conjunct is
this tree's addition; it is not attributable to either paper, and it is what
`hasDedekindINF_fails_of_interval_witness` (`Kamp/DedekindINFDense.lean:455`) turns on.

**`kplus` is not edited.** It is internally coherent with `kplusFormula` — `kplus_formula_correct`
(`Kamp/Lemma53.lean:162`) proves them equivalent — and the discrete pipeline depends on both. The
mismatch is external: the carrier apparatus built on `kplus` transcribes a different `K⁺` from the
one the axioms are stated with. `Kamp/KPlusFaithful.lean` supplies the faithful carrier beside it
and the shims relating the two; neither this file's statements nor its proofs change.

/-- K+(P)(t) **as this tree defines it — not as the sources define it**: `P` holds arbitrarily
    soon after `t`, **and** `P` does not hold at `t`.

    Semantically: `¬P(t) ∧ ∀ s > t, ∃ r ∈ (t, s), P(r)`.
    TL-definable as `kplusFormula P = P.neg ∧ ¬(⊤ U P.neg)`.

    **The first conjunct is this tree's addition.** Rabinovich's `K⁺` (PDF p.3, Definition (3):
    *"`K+(F)` holds at a moment `t` iff `t = inf({t′ | t′ > t and F holds at t′})`"*) and
    Reynolds' (printed p.168: `K⁺A` for `¬U(⊤,¬A)`) are the second conjunct alone. The
    source-exact operator is `kplusOpen` (`Kamp/KPlusFaithful.lean`), the `Prop`-level reading of
    `Formula.kPlus` (`Syntax/Formula.lean:180`); see the name-collision warning at
    `Formula.lean:163-179` and this section's comment block above. `kplus` is strictly stronger,
    and `kplus_iff_not_and_kplusOpen` states the difference exactly. -/

    such that P does not hold in (z0, r0) and either P(r0) or K+(P)(r0).

    Note: r0 < z1 is the strict version (adequate for the proof when z1 is
    the right boundary). We use r0 ≤ z1 to handle the case where the first
    occurrence is at the right boundary. -/

/-! ## Prior Structure Instantiation -/

/-- Prior structures (satisfying `SemanticPriorUZ`) have definable infima.

    **Proof**: The UZ axiom directly gives an attained first occurrence.
    Given P occurring in (z0, z1), apply UZ at z0 with P to get r0 > z0
    where P(r0) holds and ¬P on (z0, r0). Since z0 < x < z1 for some x
    with P(x), the first occurrence r0 satisfies r0 ≤ x < z1, so r0 < z1
    (hence r0 ≤ z1). The P(r0) disjunct holds outright; K+(P)(r0) is vacuous. -/
