# Proposition 4.2 at the faithful Dedekind carrier (Rabinovich, PDF p.6)

This module is the terminus of the faithful re-base. It discharges the contentful Proposition 4.2
target `Prop42Contentful` (`Prop42Contentful.lean:151`) from `HasFaithfulDedekindINF`
(`KPlusFaithful.lean:320`) **alone**, where the landed `prop42_contentful_of_attained`
(`Section5Correspondence.lean:185`) needs `HasAttainedINF` **and** `HasAttainedSUP`.

## Source correspondence

PDF **p.6** states the proposition, and the carrier is printed in the statement itself:

> **Proposition 4.2.** *(Closure under negation)* *The negation of `∃⃗∀`-formulas with at most two
> free variables is equivalent* **over Dedekind complete chains** *to a disjunction of
> `∃⃗∀`-formulas.*

"Over Dedekind complete chains" is the whole reason this module exists. The same page derives
Proposition 4.3 from it by structural induction, and Theorem 4.4 (Kamp's theorem) from 4.3 — both
also stated over Dedekind complete chains. Section 5 (pp.7-11) supplies the proof, and is consumed
here opaquely through `VVecEA2.negFixFaithful_iff` (`EANegationFixFaithful/VecEANegFixFaithful.lean`).

## What is new here and what is inherited

Nothing mathematical is new. The theorem below is one line: it pairs the witness
`v.negFixFaithful` with the biconditional `VVecEA2.negFixFaithful_iff`. That is exactly the shape
of `prop42_contentful_of_attained`, which pairs `v.negFix` with `VVecEA2.negFix_iff`. The
difference is entirely in the hypotheses, and that difference is the deliverable.

## Carrier: what `HasFaithfulDedekindINF` buys, and what it still excludes

The strengthening chain, weakest to strongest, with what is now landed marked:

```
Rabinovich's Dedekind completeness  <  HasFaithfulDedekindINF  <  HasDedekindINF  <
HasDefinableINF  <  HasAttainedINF
                       ^ this module                    the previously landed terminus ^
```

Three steps of that chain have been closed by the re-base; **one remains open**.
`HasFaithfulDedekindINF` (`KPlusFaithful.lean:320`) is still a hypothesis about the structure, not
a derivation from Dedekind completeness of the order. Closing the last step would mean deriving it
from order completeness alone, which is not attempted anywhere in this tree. So this theorem is
**not** Rabinovich's Proposition 4.2 simpliciter either, and must not be cited as such — it is
Proposition 4.2 one strengthening step away from the paper, where the attained version was four.

**What the newly closed step buys, machine-checked rather than argued.** The move from
`HasDedekindINF` to `HasFaithfulDedekindINF` drops the extra `¬P(z₀)` conjunct that this tree's
`kplus` (`PriorINF.lean:86`) carries and that neither Rabinovich's `K⁺` (Definition (3), PDF p.3)
nor Reynolds' has. It is a **strict** weakening, and the gain is exhibited at a concrete structure
by `prop42_faithful_covers_what_dedekind_excludes` below: `denseWindowFlow` is a dense Prior
model satisfying the former and refuting the latter, so Proposition 4.2 is available there from
the new carrier and unavailable from the old one.

What the remaining gap costs is recorded concretely rather than as prose:
`hasDefinableINF_excludes_kplus` (`Lemma53.lean:290`) machine-refutes the *weaker*
`HasDefinableINF` as already too strong, so the steps closed here were not decorative.

## Non-vacuity: the three ways this statement could be hollow, each closed

An over-strong hypothesis, a vacuous conclusion and a `⊤`-collapsed witness all pass sorry-free,
axiom-clean and EXIT 0 exactly as a contentful theorem does. Three machine-checked declarations
below close the three failure modes, rather than asserting their absence:

1. **Wrong quantifier order.** `prop42Faithful_perPoint_is_VACUOUS` proves the per-point ordering
   — `∃ v'` *inside* `∀ z₀ z₁` — from **no carrier hypothesis at all**. That it compiles is what
   makes it worthless, and it is the control showing `Prop42Contentful`'s hoisted `∃ v'` is a
   different statement. Same template as `lemma53Faithful_perPoint_is_VACUOUS`
   (`Lemma53Faithful.lean:354`).
2. **`⊤`-collapsed witness.** Closed upstream by `topVVec_contentful_forces_unsat`
   (`Prop42Contentful.lean:229`): offering the all-`⊤` formula as `v'` does not discharge
   `Prop42Contentful`, it commits the offerer to `v` being unsatisfiable on every ordered pair.
3. **Hollow witness — the `∃ v'` hides which formula was built.** This is the failure mode specific
   to *this* phase: `prop42_contentful_of_faithful` is silent about the witness, so a construction
   that had silently dropped the paper's limit disjunct would prove it verbatim.
   `prop42_witness_exposes_negFixFaithful` names the witness, and
   `prop42_witness_carries_limit_gate` proves the witness still fires on the `K⁺(¬β₁)(z₀)` gate
   that the faithful recursion adds at Case 1 (PDF p.9) and that the attained development
   structurally cannot carry.

## Cumulative exclusion for the whole re-base: where the difference is OBSERVABLE

`prop42_faithful_unobservable_on_prior` states the honest limit of everything landed. On every
structure that is a Prior structure in both directions, the paper's disjunct (2) `K⁺(P₁)(z₀)` and
its Since dual `K⁻(P)(z₁)` are **both provably dead**. Every live consumer in this tree is such a
structure. Therefore:

* the faithful carrier is strictly weaker, and that is machine-checked;
* no current consumer can observe the difference, and that is also machine-checked;
* observability arrives only with a genuinely non-attained Dedekind-complete frame class, which
  **this development does not build**.

`ℝ` with `P₁` interpreted as `{x | x > 0}` and `z₀ = 0` is such a structure — `inf{z ∈ (0,1) |
P₁(z)} = 0 = z₀`, so no `r₀ > z₀` has `¬P₁` below it, while `ℝ` is Dedekind complete and the paper
covers it via disjunct (2). Constructing it as a frame class is the next fidelity milestone and is
not owned here.

## `HasDedekindSUP` is not consumed

Every faithful `_iff` in the chain feeding this module assumes `HasFaithfulDedekindINF` and
nothing else; the fold, the recursion, the anchored mirrors and the bounded fixes touch no
supremum, no `K⁻` and no last-occurrence point. `HasDedekindSUP` and the Since mirror (`Lemma53FaithfulPast.lean`) are
therefore **not** hypotheses of this theorem, and adding them for symmetry would be an unused
hypothesis and a strengthening that buys nothing. They are imported here only so that
`prior_makes_kminus_disjunct_unreachable` can be consumed in the cumulative exclusion statement
below — which is a genuine use, not a symmetric one.

`prop42_contentful_of_attained_inf_only` records the practical consequence: the previously landed
`prop42_contentful_of_attained` is now a corollary whose `HasAttainedSUP` argument is unused.

/-! ## The witness, named before it is hidden behind the `∃` -/

/-- **The witness of the faithful Proposition 4.2, exposed.**

    `Prop42Contentful` existentially quantifies the negation formula, so the theorem below is
    silent about *which* `VVecEA2` discharges it. This lemma names it: the witness is
    `v.negFixFaithful`, the Prop 4.3 De Morgan fold over the faithful recursion
    (`EANegationFixFaithful/VecEANegFixFaithful.lean`), and nothing else.

    Stating this separately is not redundancy. A construction that had silently dropped, merged or
    `⊤`-erased the faithful recursion's disjuncts would prove `prop42_contentful_of_dedekind`
    verbatim, because that statement mentions only `¬v.holds`. It could not prove this one together
    with `prop42_witness_carries_limit_gate` below.

/-! ## The theorem -/

/-- **Rabinovich's Proposition 4.2 (PDF p.6), at the faithful eq (5.2) carrier.**

    Verbatim, PDF p.6: *"Proposition 4.2. (Closure under negation) The negation of ∃⃗∀-formulas
    with at most two free variables is equivalent over Dedekind complete chains to a disjunction
    of ∃⃗∀-formulas."*

    For every `VVecEA2` formula `v` there is a single `VVecEA2` formula `v'` — depending on `v`
    alone, uniform in the points — equivalent to `¬v` on every ordered pair. The witness is
    `v.negFixFaithful` and the biconditional is `VVecEA2.negFixFaithful_iff`.

    **Carrier, stated because the rule requires it.** This assumes `HasFaithfulDedekindINF`
    (`KPlusFaithful.lean:320`) alone: no `HasDedekindSUP`, no `HasDedekindINF`, no `HasAttained*`.
    That is Rabinovich's eq (5.2) dichotomy stated at the **source's own** `K⁺` (his Definition
    (3), PDF p.3) — three strengthening steps weaker than `prop42_contentful_of_attained`
    (`Section5Correspondence.lean:185`) and one step weaker than
    `prop42_contentful_of_dedekind` below, which is now its corollary.

    **What this carrier excludes** (honesty charter Rule 6). It forbids exactly those structures
    carrying a `P` and an interval `(z₀,z₁)` in which `P` occurs, such that `P` does not occur
    arbitrarily soon after `z₀` and no eq (5.2) point lies inside `(z₀,z₁)`. The exclusion is
    **exhibited**, not asserted: `prop42_faithful_covers_what_dedekind_excludes` below produces a
    concrete dense Prior structure inside the admitted class and outside `HasDedekindINF`'s.

    It is still **not** Proposition 4.2 simpliciter: `HasFaithfulDedekindINF` remains a hypothesis
    about the structure rather than a derivation from order completeness. See this module's
    docstring for that residual gap and for `prop42_faithful_unobservable_on_prior`, the proof
    that no *current* consumer can observe the gain.

    **ADAPTED-FROM**: `prop42_contentful_of_dedekind` (this module, previous pin `HasDedekindINF`,
    `DedekindINF.lean:136`), with the carrier moved to the source-exact dichotomy. The previous
    pin is retained below, unweakened, as a one-line corollary.

    Retained rather than re-pointed. Its *name* asserts its carrier, and this tree's vocabulary
    distinguishes `HasDedekindINF` from `HasFaithfulDedekindINF` sharply (two separate structures,
    two separate shims); moving this binder to the faithful carrier would leave the name asserting
    something false. Since the two are comparable — `HasDedekindINF.toHasFaithfulDedekindINF`
    (`KPlusFaithful.lean:364`) — retaining it costs one line and preserves every consumer.

/-- **The guard, non-vacuous: the faithful carrier covers a structure the previous pin excludes.**

    `prop42_contentful_of_faithful` is a strict gain over `prop42_contentful_of_dedekind`, not a
    renaming of it. `denseWindowFlow` (`PriorDefsDense.lean:336`) satisfies both dense Prior
    hypotheses, satisfies `HasFaithfulDedekindINF`
    (`hasFaithfulDedekindINF_of_dense_window`, `KPlusFaithful.lean:672`) and **refutes**
    `HasDedekindINF` (`hasDedekindINF_fails_on_dense_window`, `DedekindINFDense.lean:561`). So at
    that structure Proposition 4.2 is available from the faithful carrier and is **not** available
    from the previous pin.

    This is the faithful sibling of the role `prop42_contentful_of_attained`
    (`Section5Correspondence.lean:185`) plays for the attained chain: it is what stops the
    correspondence rotting into a chain of definitions nothing inhabits. The final conjunct is the
    part that makes it a guard rather than a carrier fact — it names `Prop42Contentful` itself,
    so a future weakening of the negation chain that made the target unreachable would break this
    declaration and not merely the carrier lemmas.

    Source correspondence: Rabinovich 2014, Proposition 4.2, PDF p.6 — "over Dedekind complete
    chains". `denseWindowFlow` is a dense sub-order of `ℝ`; the exclusion it exhibits is exactly
    the extra `¬P(z₀)` conjunct this tree's `kplus` carries and the paper's `K⁺` does not. -/

/-- **The landed attained Proposition 4.2 is now a corollary, and its `HasAttainedSUP` argument is
    unused.**

    `prop42_contentful_of_attained` (`Section5Correspondence.lean:128`) takes `h_INF :
    HasAttainedINF` *and* `h_SUP : HasAttainedSUP`, because `VVecEA2.negFix_iff`
    (`EANegationFix/VecEANegFix.lean:183`) needs both. Routed through the faithful chain, the SUP
    half is not needed at all: `HasAttainedINF.toHasFaithfulDedekindINF`
    (`KPlusFaithful.lean:382`, the direct composite) supplies the whole carrier.

    The shim runs attained → faithful only. A faithful → attained use would be a strengthening
    rather than a lift, and appears nowhere in this development. -/

/-! ## Failed-vacuity control (mandatory)

The **per-point** ordering below quantifies `∃ v'` *inside* `∀ z₀ z₁`. It is provable with **no
carrier hypothesis at all** — one picks the empty disjunction when the right hand side is false and
the all-`⊤` formula when it is true. That it compiles is exactly what makes it worthless, and it is
the control showing the hoisted `Prop42Contentful` discharged above is not the same statement.

Same template as `lemma53Faithful_perPoint_is_VACUOUS` (`Lemma53Faithful.lean:354`), re-run against
the FINAL statement of the re-base rather than against Lemma 5.3. -/

/-- **The per-point ordering of Proposition 4.2 is vacuous.** No `HasDedekindINF`, no
    `HasAttainedINF`, no Dedekind completeness, no hypothesis on `M` at all — and the witness
    depends on the points, which is precisely the content `Prop42Contentful`'s hoisted `∃ v'`
    adds. -/

/-! ## The witness is not hollow: the limit gate survives to the top

`prop42_witness_exposes_negFixFaithful` names the witness; this shows the named witness still
carries what the faithful re-base was built to restore. -/

/-- **The paper's Case 1 limit gate is live in the witness of the final theorem.**

    For a single-disjunct input `v = ⟨[⟨n, vea⟩]⟩`, the witness `v.negFixFaithful` is forced by the
    `K⁺(¬β₁)(z₀)` condition alone — the disjunct the faithful recursion adds at Case 1 (PDF p.9),
    carried by `kplusOpenLeftBlock` (`Lemma53Faithful.lean:304`), and the one the attained
    development
    structurally cannot have (`negChainOn`, `EANegationFix/OnBuilder.lean:179`, truncates it away
    on the grounds that on Prior structures the INF is always attained).

    Carrier-free: the hypothesis is `kplusOpen` at `z₀` itself — the **source's** `K⁺`,
    Rabinovich's Definition (3), PDF p.3 — not a carrier assumption that would produce it. It
    previously bound the tree's `kplus`, one conjunct stronger than the gate
    `kplusOpenLeftBlock` (`Lemma53Faithful.lean:304`) actually reads; re-pointed here for the same
    reason `negFixListFaithful_case1_is_indispensable` (`NegFixListFaithful.lean:542`) was, since
    an indispensability artifact stated at a strictly stronger gate certifies less than it
    appears to. Consumers holding the old `kplus` form recover this one by `kplusOpen_of_kplus`.
    This is the outer-fold counterpart of `VecEA2.negFixFaithful_carries_limit_gate`
    (`EANegationFixFaithful/VecEANegFixFaithful.lean:281`) — that one shows the gate is not
    discarded by the `VecEA2` lift, this one shows it is not absorbed by the outer De Morgan fold
    on the way to `Prop42Contentful`'s witness. Together they exclude the two ways the restored
    limit disjunct could vanish between the recursion and the headline theorem without any
    statement in either module becoming false. -/

/-! ## Cumulative exclusion for the whole re-base (final, required)

Everything above is strictly weaker in its hypotheses than what it replaces. This states, as a
theorem rather than as prose, the honest limit of that gain: on the structures every live consumer
in this tree actually inhabits, the gain is **not observable**. -/

/-- **On Prior structures the faithful re-base is unobservable, in both directions.**

    On a structure that is a Prior structure in the future direction (`SemanticPriorUZ`) and in the
    past direction (`SemanticPriorSZ`), the paper's disjunct (2) `K⁺(P)(z₀)` (PDF p.8) and its
    Since dual `K⁻(P)(z₁)` are **both** unreachable whenever `P` occurs strictly inside `(z₀,z₁)`.
    The two halves are `prior_makes_disjunct2_unreachable` (`Lemma53Faithful.lean:382`) and
    `prior_makes_kminus_disjunct_unreachable` (`Lemma53FaithfulPast.lean:355`); this is their
    conjunction, stated once so that the cumulative claim has a single machine-checked home.

    **Consequence, and the honest scope of this task.** Every declaration landed across the
    re-base — the faithful Lemma 5.3 and its Since mirror, the bounded fixes, the anchored mirrors,
    Lemma 5.1 at `n = 1` and its recursion, the Prop 4.2/4.3 lift chain, and
    `prop42_contentful_of_dedekind` above — is strictly weaker in its hypotheses than the attained
    version it mirrors, and that strictness is machine-checked
    (`hasDefinableINF_excludes_kplus`, `Lemma53.lean:290`). But no consumer can *see* the
    difference, because every live consumer is a Prior structure and this theorem shows the
    restored disjuncts are dead there.

    Observability requires a Dedekind-complete frame class on which the infimum is genuinely not
    attained — `ℝ` with `P₁ = {x | x > 0}` and `z₀ = 0` being the paper's own witness. **This
    development does not build such a frame class.** That is the next fidelity milestone, and
    stating it here rather than claiming coverage is the point of this theorem. -/
