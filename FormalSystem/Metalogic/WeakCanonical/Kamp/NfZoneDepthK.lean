# Phase 11 (11a): Depth-k atom/order extraction groundwork for the two-anchor zone converter

This module is the depth-`k` generalization scaffold for the two-anchor arity-3 zone
converter (Rabinovich 2014 §5, Cor 5.4 `F_i` chain). It is **off the live import path**
(nothing in the `completeness_ztime` chain imports it) and is **fully sorry-free**.

## What this file lands (sorry-free)

The forward direction of every depth-0 zone lemma (`nf_3var_zone_*_correct`,
`VecEADecomp.lean:518-731`) begins by extracting, from `NfEvalNf M 0 3 [y,x,t] ssn`, the
per-variable predicate facts and the six pairwise order facts (`h_o_yx`, `h_o_yt`, …). At
depth 0 those extractions are inlined per-atom. Here they are generalized to **arbitrary
depth `k`** as reusable lemmas:

* `nf_eval_atom_layer` — from `NfEvalNf M k n env nf` recover the atom-layer iff
  `AtomEval M env a ↔ (nf.atomAssgn a = true)` at ANY depth `k` (the atom layer is present
  at every depth: it is `nf` itself at `k = 0` and `nf.1` at `k+1`).
* `nf3_order_iff` — specialize the atom layer to an order atom on the two-anchor env
  `[y, x, t]`, giving `(env i < env j) ↔ (qnf.atomAssgn (.order i j h) = true)` for any
  `i ≠ j : Fin 3`, at any depth `k`.
* `nf3_order_yx`/`_yt`/`_xy`/`_xt`/`_ty`/`_tx` — the six concrete pairwise order facts, the
  exact `h_o_*` hypotheses `reconstruct_nf_3var` consumes, now at depth `k`.

These are the pieces of the depth-k zone converter that genuinely generalize; they de-risk the
forward direction and the Phase-14 order-atom 3-way split, and are reused verbatim by Phases
12/13/14.

## DIVERGENCE NOTE — why the depth-k zone converter is NOT finished here (Phase 11b crux)

The depth-0 zone converters express `∃ y, NfEvalNf M 0 3 [y,x,t] ssn` as a `VecEA2` whose
endpoint/witness `TemporalPred`s are the **independent per-variable projections**
(`nfXProj3`, `nfTProj3`, `nfYProj` via `nfPred`) glued by the order atoms
(`reconstruct_nf_3var`). This works at depth 0 **only because a depth-0 NF is purely atomic**:
`NormalForm sig 0 3 = AtomKind sig 3 → Bool` factors completely into per-variable predicate
assignments plus pairwise order atoms, so the three variables are independent given the order
facts.

At depth `k+1`, `NormalForm sig (k+1) 3 = (AtomKind sig 3 → Bool) × (NormalForm sig k 4 → Bool)`
carries a **quant layer** `qnf.2 : NormalForm sig k 4 → Bool` whose semantics
(`NfEvalNf`, NormalForm.lean:203-207) is
`∀ sub, (∃ w, NfEvalNf M k 4 (Fin.cons w [y,x,t]) sub) ↔ (qnf.2 sub = true)`.
This condition couples `y`, `x`, `t` **simultaneously** through the shared quantified `w`; it
does **not** factor through per-variable projections. Consequently the naive projection-based
`VecEA2` (endpoint/witness = per-variable characteristic formulas) satisfies only the `→`
direction: its `.holds` is a conjunction of independent per-anchor facts, strictly weaker than
`∃ y, NfEvalNf M k 3 [y,x,t] qnf`. The `←` direction is a genuine **NON-theorem** — the exact
structural failure already diagnosed for the x=t arm in Phase 10 (`liftIdx (totalUnskip)`
non-injectivity cannot recover non-diagonal-realizable coupled sub-forms; see the Phase 10
"Re-scoped on resume" note and the PARTIAL diagnosis, plan v39:243-285).

The faithful depth-k converter therefore requires Rabinovich's genuine inductive step (§5): the
`∃ y` must be pushed **through** the coupled quant layer using the characteristic types of the
**joint** `(w, y)` configuration relative to the two anchors, fed as segment/point
`TemporalPred`s through `bracketBuildLeft`/`bracketBuildRight`. That construction — and the x=t
arm folded in from Phase 10, which is downstream of it — is the irreducible Phase 11b crux and is
scoped to the next dispatch. No strategic `sorry` is stated here for it, because any
non-vacuous statement of the faithful converter presupposes that construction (an existential
`∃ formula, …` is vacuous — closed by `Classical.choice` — and is explicitly forbidden by the
plan's Postmortem Constraints); the honest artifact is the sorry-free extraction layer below plus
this note.

## Phase 11b progress — faithful framing landed (sorry-free), bracket integration remains

The Phase-11b dispatch (session sess_1783315428_d370a2) **replaced the refuted projection framing
with the correct characteristic-type framing** and landed its sorry-free foundation. Concretely,
these declarations (all `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`, off-path) now exist below:

* `nf_eval_quant_layer` — quant-layer companion to 11a's `nf_eval_atom_layer`; exposes the
  coupled `∃ w, NfEvalNf M k (n+1) (Fin.cons w env) sub` layer verbatim (no projection).
* `nf_zone_exists_iff_char` — reduces `∃ y, NfEvalNf M k 3 [y,x,t] qnf` to
  `∃ y, nfCharacteristic M k 3 [y,x,t] = qnf` via `nf_eval_unique`. This is the pivot: the
  target is now *characteristic-type occurrence*, not a per-variable glue.
* `exists_trichotomy_split` (generic single-boundary atom), `nf_zone_partition5`, and
  `nf_zone_exists_partition5` — the five Rabinovich `F_i` zones (`y<x`, `y=x`, `x<y<t`, `y=t`,
  `t<y`), unconditionally valid, composed with the reduction. The generic split is the reusable
  atom for BOTH the outer `y`-split and the inner `w`-split (see below).
* `nf_characteristic_atom_succ` / `nf_characteristic_quant_succ` — the depth-`k` IH interface:
  the characteristic type's atom layer is `decide ∘ AtomEval`, and its quant layer is exactly
  the coupled joint realizability set `∃ w, NfEvalNf M k (n+1) (Fin.cons w env) sub`.

**Precise continuation point (the irreducible crux, next dispatch).** Convert each *open* zone of
`nf_zone_exists_partition5` (`∃ y<x …`, `∃ x<y<t …`, `∃ y>t …`) into a temporal formula at the
anchors via `bracketBuildLeft`/`bracketBuildRight` (`VecEATranslation.lean:273/50`, correctness
`:503/:234`, shape `∃ z, order ∧ endpoint.EvalAt z ∧ bracket.holds`). The obstruction the
foundation now isolates: the endpoint/segment `TemporalPred`s must encode `char[y,x,t] = qnf`,
whose **quant layer** (via `nf_characteristic_quant_succ`) is the coupled
`∃ w, NfEvalNf M (k-1) 4 [w,y,x,t] sub`. This does not reduce to a point predicate at `y`; it
must be resolved by an **inner `w`-zone split** (apply `exists_trichotomy_split` three times, with
boundaries `y`, `x`, `t`), turning each `w`-zone into a depth-`(k-1)` IH temporal formula supplied
by `nfNvarExistAllDepthsFn` (KampPrior.lean:397, correctness `:405`, gated on
`SemanticPriorUZ/SZ`). The nested (outer `y` / inner `w`) bracket assembly is Rabinovich's
genuine Cor 5.4 `F_i` chain and is the ~400-700 line body scoped to the next dispatch. The x=t
arm (`nf_zone_partition5`'s `y=t` point zone on the diagonal env `[t,x,t]`) is downstream of the
same machinery, using `renameNF_eval_diag0` for its depth-0 base. **Do NOT** retry the
projection-based `VecEA2` (refuted; see the DIVERGENCE NOTE above).

## Phase 11b BODY progress — inner-`w` split landed (sorry-free); zones NOT independently landable

The Phase-11b **body** dispatch (session sess_1783315428_d370a2, 2nd continuation) landed the
inner-`w` split foundation the continuation point above called for, sorry-free and off-path
(all `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`, full module GREEN):

* `nf_char_eq_iff_eval` — general-depth pivot `char[…] = qnf ↔ NfEvalNf … qnf` (factors the
  reasoning inlined in `nf_zone_exists_iff_char`; used at every zone).
* `exists_nested_split3` — generic **unconditional** three-boundary nested-trichotomy split of any
  `∃`, the inner-`w` analog of `exists_trichotomy_split`. Valid for ANY placement of the three
  boundaries (nested trichotomy ⇒ exhaustive; degenerate orders merely empty/overlap zones).
* `nf_characteristic_quant_split3` — splits the coupled quant layer
  `(char[y,x,t]).quantAssgn sub` (= `∃ w, NfEvalNf M k 4 [w,y,x,t] sub` via
  `nf_characteristic_quant_succ`) into the **seven inner `w`-zones** at boundaries `y, x, t`
  (`w<y`, `w=y`, `y<w<x`, `w=x`, `x<w<t`, `w=t`, `t<w`).
* `nf_char3_eq_succ_iff` — the complete `char[y,x,t] = qnf` decomposition into atom-layer agreement
  (11a's six order facts + pred facts) AND quant-layer agreement (the coupled inner set per `sub`).

**Refined obstruction (why the zones are NOT independently landable — supersedes the "land
zone-by-zone" expectation).** Both the OUTER `y`-split (`nf_zone_partition5`) and the INNER
`w`-split (`nf_characteristic_quant_split3`) are now sorry-free. The remaining gap is a SINGLE
shared construction, not five separable arms: converting an *open* zone existential into a
temporal formula requires a **multi-anchor bounded** existential (e.g. `∃ w, y<w<x ∧ …[w,y,x,t]…`,
anchored at THREE points `y,x,t`), but the only IH engine available, `nfNvarExistAllDepthsFn`
(KampPrior:397, correctness `:405`), delivers only a **single-anchor** existential
`∃ env, NfEvalNf M k (n+1) (insertEnv env t) sub` (anchored at the one evaluation point `t`).
Bridging single-anchor IH → multi-anchor bounded zone is exactly the `bracketBuildLeft`/
`bracketBuildRight` assembly whose endpoint/segment `TemporalPred`s must themselves encode
`char[·] = qnf` via `nf_char3_eq_succ_iff` + `nf_characteristic_quant_split3` — recursively, one
depth down. This endpoint-encoding machinery is **shared verbatim across all five zones**, so no
single zone's converter arm closes in isolation; the honest unit of remaining work is the whole
nested (outer-`y` / inner-`w`) bracket-assembly body (Rabinovich Cor 5.4 `F_i` chain, ~400-700
lines), for which no non-vacuous partial statement exists (an `∃ formula, …` is
`Classical.choice`-vacuous and Postmortem-forbidden). The sorry-free artifact of this dispatch is
the inner-`w` split foundation above, which discharges the "inner `w`-zone split" step named in the
continuation point and leaves the multi-anchor bracket bridge as the sole remaining crux.

**Precise continuation (next dispatch).** Build, off-path, the multi-anchor bounded-existential
bracket bridge: for each open inner `w`-zone of `nf_characteristic_quant_split3`, express
`∃ w, (bounds y/x/t) ∧ NfEvalNf M k 4 [w,y,x,t] sub` as a `bracketBuildRight`/`bracketBuildLeft`
formula whose endpoint `TemporalPred` is the depth-`k` characteristic-type predicate (encoded via
`nf_char3_eq_succ_iff` fed one depth down), then assemble the outer `y`-zones of
`nf_zone_exists_partition5` the same way; the point zones (`y=x`,`y=t`) reduce to the diagonal
depth-0 base `renameNF_eval_diag0`. Do NOT retry projection `VecEA2`.

## Phase 11b D1 — flattening probe VERDICT: NO-GO (report 40 §3.2, session sess_1783315428_d370a2)

The "Precise continuation" above (the multi-anchor bracket bridge) was audited in
`reports/40_phase11b-divergence-audit.md` and superseded by the corrected D1 flattening probe
`nf_zone_mid_flatten_k1`. That probe was executed in the sibling module `NfZoneDepthK1Probe.lean`
and the make-or-break claim — *"the coupled quant witness `w` absorbs as a second bracket witness
on the fixed `(x, t)` interval with a single-point (depth-0 atomic) type"* — is **refuted,
sorry-free**:

* At `k = 1` the innermost `sub : NormalForm sig 0 4` fixes every pairwise order atom of
  `[w, y, x, t]`, including `(0, 2) = (w < x)`. So the coupled realizability layer
  (`nf_characteristic_quant_split3`) genuinely contains **exterior** zones `w < x` and `t < w`,
  and the mid-zone LHS's quant biconditional constrains realizability there.
* A `BracketFormula.holds M atomMap x t bf` with the mandated depth-0 **atomic** types is confined
  to the closed interval `[x, t]`: witnesses are strictly interior (`IntervalPattern.holds`), and
  atomic `EvalAt` is a local valuation (`TemporalTruth` on `.atom`/`.box`, no navigation). It
  cannot testify to nor rule out exterior-`w` realizability.
* `NfZoneDepthK1Probe.interior_bracket_cannot_realize_exterior_sub_k1` mechanizes the contradiction:
  no interior `w ∈ (x, t)` realizes an exterior-demanding `sub`.

**Consequence.** Do NOT build the flat `(x, t)`-bracket bridge — it drops exterior-`w` content the
mid-zone LHS pins down. **STOP and `/spawn` the Uniform-Prop-4.3 negation-closure route
(plan v39:181; `Prop43.lean`, `EAVecNegationClosure.lean`).** The faithful Rabinovich construction
needs past-of-`x` / future-of-`t` temporal navigation (nested `Until`/`Since`, Cor 5.4 `F_i`
chain) — exactly the endpoint machinery the flat reframing tried to avoid; it is not a flat
`BracketFormula.holds … x t` disjunction.

/-! ## Phase 11b: the joint characteristic-type reduction

The DIVERGENCE NOTE above refutes the *projection* route. The faithful route (Rabinovich §5)
keeps the witness `y` and the shared quantified `w` **jointly**, working with the
**characteristic normal form** of `[y, x, t]` rather than per-variable projections. The lemmas
below are the sorry-free foundation of that route: they replace the existential over
`NfEvalNf` by an existential over *characteristic-type equality*, and expose the quant layer
as a genuine (non-projected) coupling condition. -/

/-- Quant-layer companion to `nf_eval_atom_layer`: from a satisfied depth-`k+1` normal form,
    recover the quantifier-layer equivalence — for every depth-`k` sub-form with one extra
    variable, existential realizability over the extended env `Fin.cons w env` matches the
    quant assignment. This is the other half of the succ-case decomposition of `NfEvalNf`
    (11a landed the atom half); together they characterize a satisfied depth-`k+1` NF. The
    `∃ w` here is the coupling the projection route cannot factor — it is carried *verbatim*
    into the zone converter's realizability obligations. -/

    two-anchor arity-3 existential over the witness `y` is equivalent to the existence of a
    witness whose *characteristic normal form* at `[y, x, t]` is exactly `qnf`. By
    `nf_exists_unique`, `[y, x, t]` satisfies `qnf` iff `qnf` is its characteristic NF, so the
    `∃ y` ranges over exactly the witnesses realizing `qnf` as a characteristic type. This is
    the genuine (non-projection) reformulation on which Rabinovich's zone split (§5, Cor 5.4)
    operates: the zone converter now reasons about *which characteristic types occur* as `y`
    ranges over each zone, rather than gluing independent per-variable projections. -/

/-! ## Phase 11b: the witness zone partition (Rabinovich §5 / Cor 5.4 F_i chain)

With the target existential reduced to characteristic-type equality
(`nf_zone_exists_iff_char`), the witness `y` is split by its order position relative to the two
anchors `x`, `t`. This is the semantic skeleton of Rabinovich's `F_i` chain: five zones
`y < x`, `y = x`, `x < y < t`, `y = t`, `t < y`. The partition is **unconditionally valid** (it
case-splits on the actual order relations; degenerate anchor orders merely empty/overlap zones,
which a disjunction tolerates). Each zone existential is later converted to a temporal formula
by feeding the depth-`k` IH through `bracketBuildLeft` (past zones) / `bracketBuildRight`
(future zones). -/

    chain, §5 / Cor 5.4). Splits `∃ y, char[y,x,t] = qnf` into the five order zones of `y`
    relative to the anchors `x`, `t`. Unconditionally valid; the converter dispatches on the
    compile-time `x`/`t` order (from `qnf`'s order atoms) to select which zones are live and
    which bracket builder consumes each. The `y = x` / `y = t` point zones become the diagonal
    (two-value-collision) sub-problems handled by `renameNF_eval_diag0`; the open zones
    (`y<x`, `x<y<t`, `t<y`) become `Since`/`Until` brackets over the depth-`k` IH. -/

/-! ## Phase 11b: characteristic-type component evaluation lemmas

These expose the two layers of the *characteristic* normal form `nfCharacteristic M (k+1) n env`
as concrete decidable predicates. Combined with the zone partition, they are the interface the
depth-`k` IH plugs into: the quant layer is precisely the **coupled** joint realizability set
`∃ w, NfEvalNf M k (n+1) (Fin.cons w env) sub` (for `env = [y,x,t]` this is
`∃ w, NfEvalNf M k 4 [w,y,x,t] sub`, the `(w,y)`-joint coupling the projection route cannot
factor), and the atom layer is the pointwise `AtomEval`. -/

    coupling: for the two-anchor env `[y,x,t]` the witness `w` and the whole configuration
    `[y,x,t]` are quantified together. It is the exact predicate the depth-`k` IH formula

/-! ## Phase 11b (body): the inner `w`-zone split of the coupled quant layer

The zone converter's endpoint/segment `TemporalPred`s must encode `char[y,x,t] = qnf`. By the
foundation lemmas above, that equality decomposes into an atom-layer agreement (six order facts +
predicate facts, all pointwise decidable — 11a's extraction layer) and a **quant-layer agreement**
`∀ sub, (∃ w, NfEvalNf M k 4 [w,y,x,t] sub) ↔ qnf.quantAssgn sub` (the coupled joint
realizability set exposed sorry-free by `nf_characteristic_quant_succ`). The bracket assembly needs
this coupled `∃ w` split into `w`-zones relative to the boundaries `y, x, t`, exactly mirroring the
outer `y`-split (`nf_zone_partition5`). The lemmas below land that inner split sorry-free.

Everything here is unconditional (nested trichotomy), off-path, and carries the baseline axioms. -/

/-- **Characteristic-equality pivot** (general depth). A characteristic normal form equals a given
    `qnf` iff `qnf` is satisfied by the same environment. This factors the reasoning inlined in
    `nf_zone_exists_iff_char` into a standalone reusable lemma: it converts every *type-occurrence*
    obligation `char[…] = qnf` into a *satisfaction* obligation `NfEvalNf … qnf`, which then
    unfolds (at `k+1`) into the atom/quant layers. Used at every zone (open and point). -/

/-- **Generic three-boundary nested split** of an existential. Any witness lies, relative to the
    three boundaries `a`, `b`, `c` (taken in the fixed nesting order `a` then `b` then `c`), in one
    of seven zones: below `a`, at `a`, strictly between `a` and `b`, at `b`, strictly between `b`
    and `c`, at `c`, or above `c`. **Unconditionally valid** for ANY placement of `a, b, c` (it is a
    nested trichotomy: split on `a`, then within `> a` split on `b`, then within `> b` split on
    `c`), so degenerate boundary orders merely empty/overlap zones — a disjunction tolerates that.
    This is the inner-`w` analog of the outer atom `exists_trichotomy_split` used by

/-- **Inner `w`-zone split of the characteristic quant layer** (Rabinovich §5, inner `F_j` chain).
    The quant assignment `qnf.quantAssgn sub` of the characteristic type of `[y,x,t]` — which by
    `nf_characteristic_quant_succ` is exactly the coupled realizability set
    `∃ w, NfEvalNf M k 4 [w,y,x,t] sub` — is split into the seven inner `w`-zones relative to the
    three boundaries `y`, `x`, `t`. This is the inner analog of `nf_zone_partition5`: where that
    splits the OUTER witness `y` by the two anchors, this splits the coupled INNER witness `w` by
    the three points `y, x, t`. Each open inner zone `∃ w, (bounds) ∧ NfEvalNf M k 4 [w,y,x,t]
    sub`
    is what the depth-`(k-1)` IH formula (`nfNvarExistAllDepthsFn`, KampPrior:397) internalizes
    as a temporal segment, and each point inner zone `NfEvalNf M k 4 [p,y,x,t] sub` (`p ∈
    {y,x,t}`)
    is a diagonal (value-collision) configuration. Unconditional; off-path; baseline axioms. -/

/-- **Complete decomposition of a characteristic-type equality at depth `k+1`, two-anchor arity-3.**
    `char[y,x,t] = qnf` holds iff the atom layers agree pointwise (the six order facts + predicate
    facts — 11a's extraction layer discharges each) AND, for every depth-`k` sub-form `sub`, the
    coupled inner realizability set matches the quant assignment. This is the exact obligation the
    zone converter's endpoint `TemporalPred` must encode: the atom part is a decidable point
    predicate at the anchors, and the quant part is `nf_characteristic_quant_split3`'s inner
    `w`-zone chain fed through the depth-`(k-1)` IH. It is the succ-layer companion of the general
    `nf_char_eq_iff_eval` pivot. -/
