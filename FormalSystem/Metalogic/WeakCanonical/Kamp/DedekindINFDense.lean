# The first-occurrence carrier over a *dense* Prior structure

This module derives Rabinovich's eq (5.2) first-occurrence carrier from the **dense** Prior
hypotheses `SemanticPriorU` / `SemanticPriorS` (`PriorDefsDense.lean`) — with **no** discreteness
assumption and **no** attainment assumption. It is the dense sibling of `prior_hasDedekindINF`
(`DedekindINF.lean:232`), which is a one-liner off `prior_hasAttainedINF` and therefore consumes
the *integer* hypothesis `SemanticPriorUZ`, refuted on every dense flow by
`semanticPriorUZ_fails_of_interval_witness` (`PriorDefsDense.lean:271`).

`DedekindINF.lean` and `PriorINF.lean` are **read, not edited** by this module.

## The endpoint guard, and why it is not optional

The target was originally the unguarded `HasDedekindINF` (`DedekindINF.lean:136`). **That
statement is false over a dense Prior structure**, and this module proves it false rather than
leaving it to be discovered inside a later proof:
`hasDedekindINF_fails_of_interval_witness` refutes it on *any* densely ordered flow carrying a
formula that holds at a point `z₀` **and** throughout an interval `(z₀,z₁)` above it, and
`hasDedekindINF_fails_on_dense_window` instantiates that at Phase 9's `denseWindowFlow` — a
structure which satisfies `SemanticPriorU` and `SemanticPriorS` outright. Both disjuncts fail
there for structural reasons:

* the **left** disjunct `kplus M atomMap P z₀` is unavailable because `kplus`
  (`PriorINF.lean:86`) demands `¬P(z₀)` as its first conjunct, and `P(z₀)` holds;
* the **right** disjunct demands a `P`-free interval `(z₀,r₀)`, which density forbids when `P`
  holds throughout `(z₀,z₁)`.

The situation is Rabinovich's `r₀ = z₀` subcase with `P` true at `z₀`, which this tree's `kplus`
cannot express. The repair is to state the hypothesis under which the claim, **read through this
tree's `kplus`**, is correct.

**Correction (this claim is withdrawn).** An earlier revision of this docstring said that
Rabinovich's *"Note that `r₀ = z₀` iff `K⁺(P₁)(z₀)`"* (PDF p.8) is *false read literally*. **It is
not.** Under his own Definition (3) — *"`K+(F)` holds at a moment `t` iff
`t = inf({t′ | t′ > t and F holds at t′})`"*, PDF p.3 — the biconditional is a **definitional
restatement**, true verbatim; and Reynolds' `K⁺A` for `¬U(⊤,¬A)` (printed p.168) is the same
operator. **Neither source's `K⁺` carries a `¬A` conjunct at the point of evaluation.** What is
true is that *this tree's* `kplus` (`PriorINF.lean:86`) does carry one, and so is strictly
stronger than the operator either paper defines; read through `kplus`, the left-to-right direction
of the biconditional acquires a `¬P₁(z₀)` obligation the source's own `K⁺` never had. The tree's
source-exact spellings are `Formula.kPlus` (`Syntax/Formula.lean:180`, with the name-collision
warning at `:163-179`) and, at the `Prop` level, `kplusOpen` (`Kamp/KPlusFaithful.lean`).

In Rabinovich's Lemma 5.3 the infimum is in any case always taken at a point of the negation chain
at which the relevant predicate fails, so nothing in his construction turns on the difference.
`HasGuardedDedekindINF` below carries the `kplus`-induced obligation explicitly.

**Nothing in this module is deleted, weakened or restated by that correction**, and every theorem
below is exactly as it was: they are true theorems about `kplus`. What changed is the attribution.
`Kamp/KPlusFaithful.lean` lands the source-exact carrier `HasFaithfulDedekindINF` beside these,
proves it from `SemanticPriorU` with **no guard and no third disjunct**, and keeps this module's
carriers supplied through `HasFaithfulDedekindINF.toHasDenseDedekindINF` /
`.toHasGuardedDedekindINF`.

**The guard is a hypothesis, not a weakening of the conclusion.** The conclusion is
`HasDedekindINF`'s disjunction verbatim, character for character. Nothing is softened, no
`sorry` stands anywhere in this module, and the derivation is complete from `SemanticPriorU`
alone.

## The headline result is the trichotomy, not the guarded form

`HasGuardedDedekindINF` discharges its guard at the *call* site, and no existing consumer of
`HasDedekindINF.first_occ` in this tree can discharge it: each reaches the call from a `by_cases`
on whether `P` occurs at an **interior** point of `(z₀,z₁)`, with no hypothesis about `z₀` in
scope. So the module's primary export is `prior_hasDenseDedekindINF_dense`, valued in
`HasDenseDedekindINF` — the same statement with the endpoint case moved out of the hypothesis and
into the conclusion as a third disjunct `P(z₀)`. It is hypothesis-free, so it asks nothing at a
call site that `HasDedekindINF` did not already ask, and it is Rabinovich's own case split on
`r₀ = inf{z ∈ (z₀,z₁) | P₁(z)}` with its first two cases kept apart rather than merged. The two
forms are interderivable (`HasDenseDedekindINF.toHasGuardedDedekindINF` and its converse).

Consuming direction: `HasDedekindINF.toHasDenseDedekindINF` and
`HasDedekindINF.toHasGuardedDedekindINF` show both are *implied* by the unguarded carrier, so
every landed supplier of `HasDedekindINF` — and hence, via `HasAttainedINF.toHasDedekindINF` /
`HasDefinableINF.toHasDedekindINF` (`DedekindINF.lean:172`, `:185`), the whole discrete pipeline —
supplies them too. A consumer re-based onto `HasDenseDedekindINF` therefore serves the discrete
and the dense instance at once, at the cost of one extra case in its own proof — a case that is
genuinely reachable on a dense flow (`denseWindow_endpoint_disjunct_forced` exhibits a point where
it is the only disjunct that holds) and so cannot be avoided by any restatement.
`hasGuardedDedekindINF_not_implies_hasDedekindINF` records that the converse fails, so both are
strictly weaker than the unguarded carrier.

## What this carrier EXCLUDES (Rule 6)

`HasGuardedDedekindINF` says nothing whatever about intervals whose left endpoint satisfies `P`.
On a dense flow there is no first occurrence to name, **this tree's** `kplus` is definitionally
inapplicable there (its first conjunct fails), and `hasDedekindINF_fails_of_interval_witness`
proves that *no* carrier of `HasDedekindINF`'s exact shape can cover that case. A consumer of the
guarded form must therefore establish `¬P(z₀)` at its call site — for the negation-chain
construction of Rabinovich Lemma 5.3 this is the construction's own invariant, not a new
obligation.

**This is a limitation of the `kplus`-shaped carriers only, not of the mathematics.** At the
source's conjunct-free `K⁺` the left disjunct holds outright on exactly these intervals
(`kplusOpen_of_interval_witness`, `Kamp/KPlusFaithful.lean`), so `HasFaithfulDedekindINF` covers
the case with no guard and no third disjunct. Downstream consumers take that carrier; this
module's carriers remain landed, supplied and unedited.

## Non-vacuity

`hasGuardedDedekindINF_of_dense_window` / `hasGuardedDedekindSUP_of_dense_window` instantiate the
two theorems at `denseWindowFlow`, whose Prior-U antecedent is genuinely reachable
(`densePriorU_antecedent_reachable`, `PriorDefsDense.lean:391`). Both disjuncts of the conclusion
are reachable there: `denseWindow_kplus_at_zero` lands the **left** one at `z₀ = 0`, and
`denseWindow_guardedINF_right_disjunct` lands the **right** one at `z₀ = -1`, so neither
alternative is dead weight.

  the hypotheses of `hasDedekindINF_fails_of_interval_witness` below, the source-exact carrier's
  left disjunct **holds**, so there is no failure to refute and no guard to add. Stated at the
  source's `K⁺`, the carrier is a two-disjunct dichotomy with no endpoint case at all.

    Identical to `HasDedekindINF` (`DedekindINF.lean:136`) except for the added hypothesis
    `¬P(z₀)`. That hypothesis is exactly what makes the paper's *"`r₀ = z₀` iff `K⁺(P₁)(z₀)`"*
    true **when `K⁺` is read as this tree's `kplus`**: `kplus` (`PriorINF.lean:86`) carries
    `¬P(z₀)` in its first conjunct — a conjunct neither Rabinovich's nor Reynolds' `K⁺` has, see
    this module's docstring correction — so without the guard the `r₀ = z₀` subcase with `P` true
    at `z₀` is expressible by neither disjunct; see `hasDedekindINF_fails_of_interval_witness`.
    Read at the source's own `K⁺` the biconditional needs no guard, and the source-exact carrier
    `HasFaithfulDedekindINF` (`Kamp/KPlusFaithful.lean`) carries none.

/-! ## The trichotomy: the hypothesis-free form

`HasGuardedDedekindINF` discharges its guard at the *call* site. Every existing consumer of
`HasDedekindINF.first_occ` in this tree reaches it from a `by_cases` on whether `P` occurs at an
**interior** point of `(z₀,z₁)` and has no hypothesis whatever about `z₀`, so the guard is not
dischargeable there. The form such a consumer can actually use puts the missing case in the
*conclusion* instead: a third disjunct `P(z₀)`.

That trichotomy is Rabinovich's own case split on `r₀ = inf{z ∈ (z₀,z₁) | P₁(z)}` before he
collapses its first two cases:

* `r₀ = z₀` with `P₁(z₀)` — the disjunct `P(z₀)`;
* `r₀ = z₀` with `¬P₁(z₀)`, so `P₁` accumulates at `z₀` from above — the disjunct `K⁺(P)(z₀)`;
* `r₀ > z₀` — eq (5.2).

The paper's *"`r₀ = z₀` iff `K⁺(P₁)(z₀)`"* merges the first two, which is sound exactly under his
construction's standing `¬P₁(z₀)`. `HasDenseDedekindINF` keeps them apart, and is therefore the
faithful general statement rather than a weakening: it is hypothesis-free and, given `¬P(z₀)`,
collapses back to `HasDedekindINF`'s two-disjunct conclusion
(`HasDenseDedekindINF.toHasGuardedDedekindINF`). -/

/-- **The hypothesis-free first-occurrence carrier over a dense flow**: Rabinovich's full case
    split on `r₀ = inf{z ∈ (z₀,z₁) | P(z)}`, with the `r₀ = z₀` case kept split into its two
    genuine subcases (`P(z₀)`, and `K⁺(P)(z₀)`) instead of merged.

    This is the form downstream consumers can use unchanged: it asks nothing at the call site
    that `HasDedekindINF` did not already ask, and pays for the extra generality with one extra
    case in the conclusion — a case that is genuinely reachable on a dense flow
    (`hasDedekindINF_fails_on_dense_window` is precisely a point where it is the only one that
    holds). -/

Rabinovich 2014, Lemma 5.3 Case 2 and eq (5.2), PDF p.8, obtained from Reynolds' Prior-U
(printed p.168) instantiated at `p := ¬P`. No discreteness, no attainment, no flow completeness:
`SemanticPriorU` alone. -/

/-- **`SemanticPriorU` yields the guarded eq (5.2) carrier** (Rabinovich 2014, Lemma 5.3 Case 2
    and eq (5.2), PDF p.8; derived from Reynolds 1992, Prior-U, printed p.168).

    The derivation instantiates Prior-U at `p := ¬P`, following the paper's Case 2 exactly:

    1. If `K⁺(P)(z₀)` holds, take the left disjunct and stop — this is the paper's
       *"Subcase `r₀ = z₀`"*.
    2. Otherwise, since the guard already supplies `¬P(z₀)`, the failure of `K⁺(P)(z₀)` must be
       in its second conjunct: `¬P` holds throughout some initial stretch above `z₀`. That is
       Prior-U's first antecedent `U(⊤,¬P)(z₀)`.
    3. `P` occurs inside `(z₀,z₁)`, which is Prior-U's second antecedent `F¬¬P(z₀)`.
    4. Prior-U's conclusion `U(P ∨ K⁺(P), ¬P)(z₀)` supplies `r₀ > z₀` with `¬P` throughout
       `(z₀,r₀)` and `P(r₀) ∨ K⁺(P)(r₀)`.
    5. `r₀ < z₁`, because `P` occurs at some `x ∈ (z₀,z₁)` while `¬P` holds on `(z₀,r₀)`, forcing
       `r₀ ≤ x < z₁`.
    6. Steps 4-5 are eq (5.2) verbatim — the right disjunct.

    **This derivation does not route through `prior_hasAttainedINF` (`PriorINF.lean:230`) and
    therefore carries no discreteness.** That is the whole point: `prior_hasAttainedINF` consumes
    `SemanticPriorUZ`, which `semanticPriorUZ_fails_of_interval_witness`
    (`PriorDefsDense.lean:271`) refutes on every densely ordered flow carrying a formula true
    throughout an open interval. No attainment hypothesis and no completeness hypothesis on the
    flow is used here either. -/

    Case 2 and eq (5.2) mirrored, PDF p.8; derived from Reynolds 1992, Prior-S, printed p.168).

    The exact mirror of `prior_hasGuardedDedekindINF_dense`, instantiating Prior-S at `p := ¬P`:
    the guard `¬P(z₁)` plus failure of `K⁻(P)(z₁)` gives Prior-S's first antecedent `S(⊤,¬P)(z₁)`,
    the occurrence of `P` inside `(z₀,z₁)` gives `P¬¬P(z₁)`, and Prior-S's conclusion
    `S(P ∨ K⁻(P), ¬P)(z₁)` is the mirrored eq (5.2).

    As with the `INF` direction, this routes through neither `prior_hasAttainedSUP` nor any

/-! ## The exclusion lemma: the *unguarded* carrier is refutable on a dense flow

The dense counterpart of `semanticPriorUZ_fails_of_interval_witness` (`PriorDefsDense.lean:271`),
and the reason the guard above is a hypothesis rather than an oversight. -/

    `z₀` and throughout an interval above it.**

    Both disjuncts of `HasDedekindINF.first_occ` are unavailable: the left one because `kplus`
    (`PriorINF.lean:86`) demands `¬P(z₀)`, the right one because it demands a `P`-free interval
    `(z₀,r₀)`, which density populates with points of `(z₀,z₁)` where `P` holds by hypothesis.

    This is Rabinovich's `r₀ = z₀` subcase with `P` true at `z₀` (PDF p.8). It names exactly which
    structures the *unguarded* carrier admits — those in which no formula holds both at a point
    and on an interval immediately above it, in particular the discrete ones, where the interval
    below the successor is empty — and which it forbids. -/
