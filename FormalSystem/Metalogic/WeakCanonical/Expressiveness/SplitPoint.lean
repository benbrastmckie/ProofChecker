/-! ## GHR93 Theorem 6: Inductive Step Infrastructure

The inductive step of Theorem 6 converts a forward (4+3n)-round strategy
into a backward (n+1)-round strategy. The proof introduces key quantities
from the GHR93 argument:

- **d**: A "split point" in N_r that separates the interval [x',y'] based on
  where the forward strategy's type pattern changes. Formally, d is defined
  using the interval type A = X_{(a_{n-1}, a_n)} and a continuation formula C.

- **c**: The corresponding split point in M_r, obtained by applying the
  forward strategy to d.

- **σ, τ**: Backward strategies on sub-intervals [x',d]/[x,c] and
  [d,y']/[c,y], obtained by restricting the master forward strategy and
  applying the inductive hypothesis (*)_n.

The proof then splits into four cases based on the nature of a_n (Spoiler's
last selection in the backward game). -/

/-- Properties of the split points c, d that are needed for the case analysis.

    **GHR93 rank structure**: The `delta` parameter captures the rank offset
    between the backward game's rank `r` and the rank at which sigma/tau play.
    In GHR93, the induction peels off 4 from the rank at each step, so sigma/tau
    end up at rank `r + delta` (with delta = 4 in the inductive step). Positions
    c, d, x, y, x', y' live at rank `r`, and sigma/tau play on rank-embedded
    positions via `rankEmbed (by omega : r ≤ r + delta)`.

    When `delta = 0`, this reduces to the original structure (sigma/tau at rank r). -/

-- `obtain_split_point_props` builds every split-point obligation (strategy restriction,
-- sub-interval point existence, both gap cases on each side) inside one tactic block, so
-- it does not elaborate within the default 200000-heartbeat budget.
/-- Obtain the split point properties. This is the core setup lemma for
    the inductive step, combining strategy restriction and IH application.

    **Approach** (simplified from GHR93, avoids infimum infrastructure):

    1. Set d = a_bwd(n) — Spoiler's last backward pick. Then hd_eq_an is rfl.
    2. Play the forward (4+3n)-round strategy with 1 element from [x,y] to find a
       compatible point c. Specifically, use round_mono to get a 1-round strategy,
       then play it to find c such that c and d have the same RankType and
       gap/point status.
    3. Apply strategy_restrict_left/right with c,d to restrict the forward strategy
       from [x,y] to [x,c] and [c,y] (consuming one round each).
    4. Apply round_mono to reduce rounds to 1+3n.
    5. Apply the generalized IH on the sub-intervals to get sigma and tau.

    The generalized IH is universally quantified over endpoints, so it can be
    applied to sub-intervals [x,c]/[x',d] and [c,y]/[d,y'].

    Key insight: We do NOT need to compute an infimum. Setting d = a_bwd(n)
    and obtaining c from the forward strategy is sufficient. The winning
    condition of the forward game guarantees that c and d are compatible
    (same RankType, same gap/point status).

    Steps 2-5 are fully proved (sorry-free), discharged via the real
    `ghr93_strategy_restrict_left`/`ghr93_strategy_restrict_right` theorems
    (`EFGames/CustomGame.lean`) and the sub-interval `h_pt` witness construction below. -/
