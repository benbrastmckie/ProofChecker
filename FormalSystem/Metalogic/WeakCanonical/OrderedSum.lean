# Ordered Sum Theorems for Monadic Structures

Contains the key theorems about ordered sums of monadic structures,
building on definitions from NEquivalence.lean.

## Key theorems
- `doets_lemma_1_4`: ordered sum preserves k-equivalence (via KEquivalenceFramework)

## Status
- `doets_lemma_1_4`: closed (delegates to KEquivalenceFramework.sum_preservation)
- `doets_lemma_1_5`: **proved**, as `RealModel/ShuffleReal.lean`'s `doets_lemma_1_5`, in
  Doets 1987 3.1.8's *coloured index order* form rather than the archived draft's
  type-matching form. Its proof is `kEquiv_orderedSum_of_kEquiv_colour` (`MixedSum.lean`),
  the mixing lemma, via the `BackForth` engine of `BackAndForth.lean`; no `sorry` is involved.
  The archived draft in `Boneyard/SorriedDeclExcisions/SingletonSorriedDecls.lean` sits behind
  `#exit`, uses the stale names `k_type_of`/`k_equiv`, and is superseded: its hypothesis
  (matching *sets* of realized k-types) does not in fact imply its conclusion, since it takes no
  account of the order in which the types occur. Do not revive it.

/--
Doets Lemma 1.4: k-equivalence is preserved by ordered sums.

If for all i, m(i) is k-equivalent to m'(i), then the ordered sums
are k-equivalent.

**Status**: Closed. Delegates to KEquivalenceFramework.sum_preservation.
