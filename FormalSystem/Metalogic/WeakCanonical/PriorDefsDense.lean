# Dense Prior Structure Semantic Hypotheses

Defines `SemanticPriorU` and `SemanticPriorS` — the semantic reading of Reynolds' **Prior-U** and
**Prior-S** axioms — together with the witnesses that separate them from the *integer* hypotheses
`SemanticPriorUZ` / `SemanticPriorSZ` of the sibling module `PriorDefs.lean`.

## The axioms, verbatim

Reynolds 1992, *An Axiomatization for Until and Since over the Reals without the IRR Rule*,
printed p.168 (PDF page 4; the printed page was re-verified against the PDF while this module was
written):

```
Prior-U:   U(⊤,p) ∧ F¬p → U(¬p ∨ K⁺(¬p),p)
Prior-S:   S(⊤,p) ∧ P¬p → S(¬p ∨ K⁻(¬p),p)
```

and, printed p.176: *"Call a linear temporal structure a Prior structure if it satisfies all
substitution instances of Prior-U and Prior-S. It is easy to see that then there are no definable
gaps. Note that this result does not hold for the original Prior axioms in the language of `F` and
`P`."*

The object-level axioms already exist in this tree as `Axiom.prior_U_gap`
(`ProofSystem/Axioms.lean:377`) and `Axiom.prior_S_gap` (`:387`), each of which carries an explicit
"THIS IS NOT `prior_UZ`/`prior_SZ`" caveat. `SemanticPriorU` / `SemanticPriorS` below are the
semantic side of exactly those two axioms, read at an `OrderedMonadicStructure` in the same idiom
`PriorDefs.lean` uses for the integer pair.

Unfolding the temporal operators with this tree's `TemporalTruth` (`Table.lean:188`):

* `U(A,B)(t)` is `∃ s > t, A(s) ∧ ∀ r ∈ (t,s), B(r)` (the prefix `U(·,·)` rendering is
  event-first: first argument the event, second the guard — the reverse of the `Formula.untl`
  constructor's guard-first arguments);
* `U(⊤,p)(t)` is therefore *"`p` holds throughout some initial stretch above `t`"*;
* `F¬p(t)` is *"`¬p` somewhere above `t`"*;
* `K⁺(A)(s)` is `kplus` (`Kamp/PriorINF.lean:86`): `¬A(s) ∧ ∀ u > s, ∃ r ∈ (s,u), A(r)`, so
  `K⁺(¬p)(s)` is `p(s) ∧ ∀ u > s, ∃ r ∈ (s,u), ¬p(r)`.

The definitions below carry that unfolding literally, with the object-level negation read as
metalevel negation (`TemporalTruth` interprets `Formula.neg` classically, so the two agree —
`temporal_truth_neg`, `Kamp/Translation.lean:47`). Reading the negations metalevel keeps this
module's imports at `PriorDefs.lean` and avoids an edge into the `Kamp/` subtree.

## What this carrier EXCLUDES (Rule 6)

`SemanticPriorU` does **not** imply `SemanticPriorUZ`, and on a densely ordered flow it cannot:

* `semanticPriorUZ_fails_of_interval_witness` proves that on **any** densely ordered flow,
  `SemanticPriorUZ` fails as soon as a single formula holds throughout one nonempty open interval.
  `SemanticPriorUZ` demands a *first* occurrence of `ψ` above `t`, and a first occurrence is
  incompatible with `ψ` holding on an open right-neighbourhood — the generic situation on a dense
  flow. This is the machine-checked form of the vacuity finding that makes the integer hypotheses
  the wrong ones here.
* `semanticPriorU_not_implies_semanticPriorUZ` exhibits one structure — the real line with a single
  predicate true exactly on the open right-ray `(0,∞)` — satisfying `SemanticPriorU` **and**
  `SemanticPriorS` while refuting `SemanticPriorUZ`.

Consequently every declaration pinned at `SemanticPriorUZ` / `SemanticPriorSZ` (among them
`uSExpressivelyCompleteOverPrior`, `prior_hasAttainedINF`, `prior_hasDedekindINF`) is unavailable
at a dense flow, and the dense siblings must be built beside them rather than by reuse.

## Non-vacuity

* `semanticPriorU_of_flowGLB` / `semanticPriorS_of_flowLUB`: **every** Dedekind-complete flow is a
  Prior structure in this sense, for every interpretation and every formula. Reynolds asserts this
  much at printed p.168 (*"It is clear that all these axioms are valid over the reals"*) and p.169
  (*"The axioms are valid in structures over the reals because there are no gaps at all so no
  definable ones"*); he gives no argument, so the greatest-lower-bound derivation here is original
  glue rather than a transcription.
* `realFlowStructure` instantiates that at `ℝ` with an arbitrary predicate, and
  `denseRayFlow` / `denseWindowFlow` are the two concrete witnesses: a predicate that is neither
  empty nor the whole carrier in each case, densely ordered carrier, and — for the window — the
  Prior-U antecedent actually satisfied (`densePriorU_antecedent_reachable`), so the implication is
  not discharged vacuously.

Dedekind completeness of the flow is threaded as an explicit `Prop` (`FlowGLB` / `FlowLUB`) rather
than as a typeclass, matching the treatment of the least-upper-bound property in
`Semantics/Validity.lean`'s `ValidRTime` and `real_lub_of_bddAbove`
(`BXCanonical/CompletenessDedekind.lean:127`).

Completeness of the flow is a *sufficient* condition here, not a necessary one: the countable dense
Prior structures this development ultimately consumes are Prior structures because the axioms are
valid in the canonical model (Reynolds §4 Corollary 1), not because their flow is complete.

/-! ## The dense Prior hypotheses -/

/-- **Semantic Prior-U** — Reynolds 1992, printed p.168: `U(⊤,p) ∧ F¬p → U(¬p ∨ K⁺(¬p),p)`, at
every point and every formula.

Read out: if `p` holds throughout some initial stretch above `t`, and `¬p` holds somewhere above
`t`, then there is `s > t` with `p` throughout `(t,s)` such that at `s` either `¬p` holds, or `p`
holds and `¬p` holds arbitrarily soon after `s` (the second disjunct is `K⁺(¬p)(s)`, i.e. `kplus`
of `¬p`, `Kamp/PriorINF.lean:86`).

This is the semantic side of `Axiom.prior_U_gap` (`ProofSystem/Axioms.lean:377`). It is **not**
`SemanticPriorUZ` (`PriorDefs.lean:28`) and does not imply it — see
`semanticPriorU_not_implies_semanticPriorUZ`. `SemanticPriorUZ` asks for a *first* occurrence;
Prior-U asks only for a point at which `p` stops holding **or** at which `¬p` accumulates from
above, which is precisely the weakening that survives a dense flow. -/

mirror of `SemanticPriorU` in the past direction, with `K⁻` (`kminus`, `Kamp/PriorINF.lean:98`) in
place of `K⁺`.

/-! ## Every Dedekind-complete flow is a Prior structure

Reynolds, printed p.168: *"It is clear that all these axioms are valid over the reals"*, and
p.169: *"The axioms are valid in structures over the reals because there are no gaps at all so no
definable ones."* He gives no proof; the two theorems below supply one, and they are therefore
original glue on a sourced statement rather than transcriptions. -/

/-- On a flow with greatest lower bounds, `SemanticPriorU` holds for every interpretation and every
formula.

Proof: the infimum `r` of the set `A = {x > t | ¬p(x)}` is the required point. `A` is nonempty by
the `F¬p` conjunct and bounded below by `t`; the `U(⊤,p)` conjunct makes the stretch's right
endpoint a lower bound of `A`, so `r > t`. Every point of `(t,r)` is below the infimum, hence
outside `A`, hence satisfies `p`. At `r` itself either `¬p` holds — the left disjunct — or `p`
holds, in which case no point above `r` can bound `A` below, which is exactly `K⁺(¬p)(r)`.

No density, discreteness or attainment is used. -/

/-! ## The exclusion lemma: `SemanticPriorUZ` cannot hold on a dense flow -/

/-- **On a densely ordered flow, `SemanticPriorUZ` fails as soon as any formula holds throughout a
nonempty open interval.**

`SemanticPriorUZ` (`PriorDefs.lean:28`) demands a *first* occurrence of `ψ` above `t`, with `ψ`
false everywhere strictly between. If `ψ` holds throughout `(t,s₁)` then density produces a point
of `(t,s)` below any candidate first occurrence `s` at which `ψ` holds anyway, and the demand is
contradictory.

This is the exclusion lemma required of a new hypothesis by the anti-vacuity discipline: it names
exactly which structures the *integer* hypothesis admits (those in which no formula holds on an
open interval — in particular the discrete ones, where the interval below the successor is empty)
and which it forbids. -/
