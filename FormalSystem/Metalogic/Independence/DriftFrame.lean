# F° — the drift frame over `ℝ`

The second half of the **indistinguishable pair** behind `cor:no-characterization`, and the
frame of `app:drift`. Like `F¹` (`Independence/RealTranslationFrame.lean`) it has `W = D = ℝ`,
but its task relation is a *band* rather than a translation:

`w ⇒_x u  :⟺  u - w` lies in the (unordered) interval between `x` and `2x`.

For `x ≥ 0` this is the paper's `x ≤ u - w ≤ 2x`: a process that drifts forward at a rate
somewhere between `1` and `2`. Being a band rather than a graph, the relation is **not**
functional, so `F°` is **not** deterministic (`fzero_not_deterministic`) — and yet, by
`Independence/DeterminismUndefinable.lean`, it validates *Determined*.

## Main Definitions

- `fzeroRel` — the drift relation
- `fzeroFrame : FrameOver realTemporalOrder` — `F°` as a fibre, all six axioms discharged
- `F0 : TaskFrame` — its inclusion into the total space

## Main Results

- `fib_eq_Icc` / `fib_eq_Icc'`, `isCompact_fib`, `isClosed_fib` — the fibres are closed bounded
  intervals, which is what makes *Saturation* a compactness argument
- `fzero_nullity`, `fzero_converse`, `fzero_serial`, `fzero_comp`, `fzero_limit`,
  `fzero_saturation` — the six `FrameOver` obligations
- `fzero_not_deterministic` — `0 ⇒_1 1` and `0 ⇒_1 2`, so `F°` fails `def:deterministic`

## The `uIcc` encoding

`app:drift` states the relation only for `x ≥ 0`. `FrameOver.converse` is a structure field, so
the relation must be defined at negative durations too, and it must satisfy
`w ⇒_x u ↔ u ⇒_{-x} w` **on the nose**. The unordered interval `Set.uIcc x (2 * x)` is exactly
the two-sided extension that makes this hold definitionally: for `x < 0` it is `[2x, x]`, which
is the reflected band, so `converse` is a `linarith` case split and nothing more.

## The `comp` scope note — why F° is a frame at all

The tree's *Compositionality* predicate (`TaskFrame.Compositional`, `Semantics/TaskFrame.lean`)
is confined to `0 ≤ x` and `0 ≤ y`. `F°` genuinely **fails** mixed-sign composition — a forward
drift followed by a backward drift need not land where a single drift of the summed duration
could — so had the axiom been stated two-sidedly, `F°` would not be a task frame and this entire
independence result would be unavailable. The narrow scope is not a convenience here; it is
load-bearing, and worth knowing before anyone "strengthens" that predicate.

## Two deliberate deviations from `app:drift`'s proof

1. **Interpolation without division.** `app:drift` interpolates with `λ := (v - w)/(x + y)`,
   which needs `x + y ≠ 0` and hence a separate degenerate case. The proof here splits on
   `le_total (w + x) (v - 2 * y)` and takes whichever endpoint of the overlap is available: no
   division, no degenerate case, and `linarith` closes every branch.
2. **Saturation via Mathlib's Cantor lemma.** `app:drift` argues by the finite intersection
   property directly; here the fibres and segments are compact and closed
   (`isCompact_fib`, `isClosed_fib`) and
   `IsCompact.nonempty_sInter_of_directed_nonempty_isCompact_isClosed` finishes it. Note that
   `TaskFrame.limit_of_shift` does **not** apply: that helper wants a functional relation, and
   this one is not functional. A topology-free `csSup` route exists as a fallback if the topology
   imports ever become unwelcome.

## Why F° survives density where `natFrame` does not

`natFrame` — the frame carrying the `⊡` non-validities in `Semantics/PlusNonValidities.lean` —
relates every state to every state at every nonzero duration, so its cone at a state is the whole
carrier and its *Limit* field needs a discrete carrier to hold at all. `F°`'s fibres are the
bounded intervals `[w + d, w + 2d]`, whose width `d` shrinks linearly to `0`, so the cone shrinks
in any order whatever and *Limit* holds over `ℝ`. The two frames are not interchangeable, and no
result about one transfers to the other.

## A `ℤ` carrier does not work

Taking `W = D = ℤ` with the same band relation gives a legal frame but a **useless** one for the
purpose here: over `ℤ` a history's state function is not surjective onto the states, so the
`untl` case of `Independence/StateSetTruth.lean`'s recursion — which needs every state strictly
above the present one to be *reached* — fails. The choice of `ℝ` is essential, and the `[d, 2d]`
bracket is precisely what forces surjectivity, via the intermediate value theorem on a Lipschitz
state function (`Independence/DriftHistories.lean`). Recorded so that nobody "simplifies" the
carrier.
