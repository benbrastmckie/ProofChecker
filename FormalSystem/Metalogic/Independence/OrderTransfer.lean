# Order transfer under (H1) and (H2) — the frame-independent layer

The temporal cases of the state-set recursion (`Independence/StateSetTruth.lean`) turn on one
fact about a frame and nothing else: **its total histories are order-isomorphisms of the duration
order onto the state order.** That fact is isolated here as two hypotheses, and everything the
recursion needs from it is proved once, against the hypotheses alone.

## The two hypotheses

- `OrderFlow F` — **(H1)**: every total history's state function is strictly monotone, reaches
  every strictly greater state at some strictly later time, and every strictly lesser state at
  some strictly earlier time. Equivalently: each total history is an order-isomorphism of
  `F.Duration` onto `F.WorldState`.
- `StateOccurs F` — **(H2)**: every world state lies on some total history at every time. This is
  the hypothesis the `□` case consumes, and stating it as a hypothesis rather than deriving it
  is what keeps the development constructive: the general "every state occurs" fact
  (`cor:occurrence`) goes through `thm:extension` and hence Zorn, whereas each frame this is
  instantiated at supplies an *explicit* witness.

## Main Results

- `OrderFlow.lt_iff` — a total history's state function is order-*reflecting* as well as
  order-preserving
- `OrderFlow.future_image` / `OrderFlow.past_image` — the image of a strict future (past) of `x`
  under a total history is exactly the strict upper (lower) set of the state at `x`
- `OrderFlow.between` / `OrderFlow.between_past` — the **change of variables**: `x < c < y`
  matches `τ(x) < τ(c) < τ(y)` in both directions, which is exactly what the `untl` and `snce`
  cases need
- `StateOccurs.state_image` — under (H2) the states occupied at a fixed time by the totality of
  total histories are all of `F.WorldState`

## Why one generic layer and not two parallel developments

The recursion these lemmas serve mentions **only the order on `W`** and neither frame's task
relation. That is the crux clause of `cor:no-characterization`: two frames whose histories are
order-isomorphisms of the same order onto the same state order satisfy the same recursion, so
they validate exactly the same L⋆ formulas — even when one is deterministic and the other is
not. Written as two parallel inductions the point would be invisible; written once against (H1)
and (H2) it is the statement of this module.

## Terminology of record: an *indistinguishable* pair, not a "separating" one

The two frames this is instantiated at (`Independence/DriftFrame.lean` and
`Independence/RealTranslationFrame.lean`) **agree** on every store-free, recall-free sentence
while differing in determinism. The argument is *elimination by indistinguishability*: no L⋆
sentence can tell them apart, so no set of L⋆ sentences defines determinism. Calling them a
"separating pair" inverts the mechanism, and has already misled one reader into expecting the
non-deterministic member to *refute* *Determined* — which it in fact validates.

## (H1) — total histories are order-isomorphisms
-/

/--
**(H1)**: every total history of `F` is an order-isomorphism of the duration order onto the
world-state order.

The three fields are strict monotonicity and the two surjectivity halves. Nothing here mentions
the task relation; a frame satisfies (H1) or not purely in virtue of what its total histories
look like as functions.

**Change of variables, future form.** A state strictly between `τ(x)` and `τ(y)` is `τ(c)` for a
time `c` strictly between `x` and `y`.

This is the `untl` case's whole content: the recursion's interval condition ranges over states
between two states, the truth recursion's over times between two times, and this lemma is the
translation in one direction (the other being `strictMono`).

**(H2)**: for every world state `w` and every time `x`, some total history has state `w` at
time `x`.

Stated as a hypothesis rather than proved: the general fact (`cor:occurrence`) needs
`thm:extension` and hence Zorn, while each frame this is instantiated at supplies a witness
explicitly. That is what keeps the non-definability result choice-free.
