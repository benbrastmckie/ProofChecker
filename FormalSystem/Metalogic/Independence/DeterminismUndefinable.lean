# `Deterministic` is not L⋆-definable — `cor:no-characterization`

The two headline results, obtained by instantiating the generic state-set bridge
(`Independence/StateSetTruth.lean`) at the **indistinguishable pair** `F°` (the drift frame,
`Independence/DriftFrame.lean`) and `F¹` (the translation flow,
`Independence/RealTranslationFrame.lean`).

## Main Results

- `fzero_determined` together with `fzero_not_deterministic` — **(T3)**: a frame that validates
  *Determined* without being deterministic, so the converse of
  `determined_of_deterministic` (`Semantics/StarDeterminism.lean`) fails
- `fzero_starValidOn_iff_f1` — **(T4)**: `F°` and `F¹` validate exactly the same `StarFormula`s
- `deterministic_not_starDefinable` — the conclusion: no set of L⋆ formulas defines the
  deterministic frames

## The three-way split the "exactly" claim conflates

The claim *"Determined (`φ → ⊡φ`) is valid exactly over the Deterministic frames"* runs together
three different regions, and only the first two coincide:

1. `⊡` trivializes **semantically** — `⟨τ⟩_x` is a singleton at every total history and time —
   **exactly** on the deterministic frames. That is `lem:deterministic-singleton`, whose (⇒) half
   is `states_eq_of_deterministic`.
2. `⊡` trivializes **logically** — *Determined* is frame-valid — on a class **strictly
   containing** them. `F°` is in that class (`fzero_determined`) and not deterministic
   (`fzero_not_deterministic`): its histories through a given state at a given time are many, but
   they all agree on every L⋆ formula, which is all validity can see.
3. Neither region is **L⋆-definable** (`deterministic_not_starDefinable`).

So the ⇒ direction of the claim holds (`determined_of_deterministic`), the ⇐ direction is false,
and no repair by a different formula set is possible.

## Uniform substitution is unsound here

`p → ⊡p` is frame-valid over `F°`, while `Fp → ⊡Fp` is refutable over `natFrame`
(`refute_determined`, `Semantics/StarNonValidities.lean`). A schema's validity at atomic
instances therefore does not transfer to its substitution instances in this setting — atoms are
state formulas by definition of the valuation, and general formulas are not. **No proof in this
development argues by substitution**, and none may.

## Axiom pin (C4)

Recorded from `#print axioms` at the time of writing, and re-checkable by uncommenting:

```
#print axioms FormalSystem.Metalogic.Independence.fzero_determined
#print axioms FormalSystem.Metalogic.Independence.fzero_starValidOn_iff_f1
#print axioms FormalSystem.Metalogic.Independence.deterministic_not_starDefinable
```

All three report `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`, and the `Classical.choice` is
**carrier-borne, not argument-borne**. Three cross-checks establish that, and they are the pin
that actually matters:

* `#print axioms fzero_not_deterministic` — a statement whose entire proof is two `norm_num`
  facts about `1` and `2` — already reports `Classical.choice`. It comes with `ℝ` itself, whose
  order and field structure are classical in Mathlib.
* `#print axioms starTruthAt_iff_mem_satSet` reports `[propext]` **alone**, and
  `#print axioms determined_of_orderFlow` reports `[propext, Quot.sound]`. The entire generic
  argument — the state-set recursion, the bridge, and the validity corollary — is therefore
  choice-free; only its *instantiation* at a real carrier is not.
* The two hypotheses that *could* have needed `thm:extension` and Zorn, namely
  `fzero_stateOccurs` and `f1_stateOccurs`, are discharged by **explicit affine witnesses**
  rather than by `cor:occurrence`.

So no step here is a "validity ⟹ frame condition" step, and nothing reintroduces the ZFC
direction that `Semantics/StarDeterminism.lean`'s docstring stays clear of; that module's own
collapse theorems still report `[propext]` alone.

**(T3): the "exactly" claim is false.** `F°` validates every instance of *Determined* and is not

**(T4): `F°` and `F¹` validate exactly the same L⋆ formulas.**

Both sides reduce, by `starValidOn_iff_satSet_univ`, to the *same* frame-free condition — that
`satSet V φ` is all of `ℝ` for every valuation `V` — because the state-set recursion mentions
only the order on `ℝ` and neither task relation.

/--
**`Deterministic` is not L⋆-definable** (`cor:no-characterization`).

No set `Γ` of `StarFormula`s has "`F` validates every member of `Γ`" equivalent to
`F.Deterministic`. Any such `Γ` would be validated by `F¹`, which is deterministic; by (T4) it
would then be validated by `F°`; and `F°` is not deterministic.

This is *elimination by indistinguishability*, not separation: the two frames **agree** on every
L⋆ sentence, which is precisely why no such sentence set can tell determinism apart.
