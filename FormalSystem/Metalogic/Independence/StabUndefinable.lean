# The stability modal is not L-definable

`stabNotDefinable`: **no** `Formula` of L is equivalent to the `PlusFormula` `⊡Fp` across all task
models. This is the result that answers "why is L⁺ a separate language at all" — `⊡` is not
shorthand for anything L can already say.

## The two models

Both live over `ℤ`, both realize **exactly the same atom profiles** along their total histories,
and they differ only in *which* histories share a world state at a given time.

| | frame | total histories | `⟨τ⟩₀` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `M₁` | `NF`, the permissive frame (`Semantics/TaskFrame.lean`, `natFrame`) | every `f : ℤ → ℕ` | every history agreeing with `τ` at `0` |
| `M₂` | `multiFamTaskFrameGen`, the deterministic clock at family index `ℤ → ℕ` | the flow lines `t ↦ (g, w₀ + t)` | `{τ}` |

The separating point is `(τ₁, 0)` against `(τ₂, 0)`, where both histories carry the profile
"`p` at time `1` and nowhere else":

* `Fp` holds at both — witness `t = 1`.
* `⊡Fp` **fails** at `(τ₁, 0)`: the constant history shares `τ₁`'s state at `0` and never
  reaches `p`.
* `⊡Fp` **holds** at `(τ₂, 0)`: `M₂`'s frame is deterministic, so `⊡` collapses onto its argument
  (`stab_iff_of_deterministic`, `Semantics/PlusDeterminism.lean`) and `Fp` holds.

## The invariance notion is the tree's own `TruthCorr`

No new bisimulation machinery is introduced. `TruthCorr` (`Semantics/Truth.lean`) already
packages exactly what an L formula can see — an order isomorphism of times, a relation on
histories, agreement on atoms at related pairs, and the two `□`-existence conditions — and
`truthAt_of_truthCorr` transports every `Formula` along it. Here the relation is simply
"agrees on every atom at every time", so the `atom` field is definitional and the two totality
fields are the profile-matching constructions above.

## Why the separator has to be temporal

An *atomic* separator is impossible: `p → ⊡p` is valid on every frame (`stab_atom_of_atom`,
`Semantics/PlusTruth.lean`, the AS axiom), because an atom's truth depends on the world state
alone — which is exactly what `⊡` quantifies over. So `⊡p ↔ p` everywhere and no atom can
witness anything. `Fp` is the least temporal formula that can, which is why the statement is
about `⊡Fp` and not about `⊡` at an arbitrary argument.

Note also that `□Fp` fails at **both** points (`box_someFuture_false_left`,
`box_someFuture_false_right`): the separation is not one `□` could have made either, which is the
point — `⊡` sits strictly between the identity and `□`.

/-! ## The truth correspondence

The relation is "agrees on every atom at every time". The `atom` field is then definitional, and
the two totality fields are the profile-matching constructions: forward, read the profile off the
`M₁` history and flow it; backward, read the `ℕ`-value off the `M₂` history's own states and feed
it to `natHist`, which accepts *any* function because `NF` is permissive.

conversely; the relation recording that is a `TruthCorr`. -/

/-! ## The theorem -/

/--
**The stability modal is not L-definable.** No `Formula` `ψ` of L is equivalent to the
`PlusFormula` `⊡Fp` at every task model, total history and time.

Any such `ψ` would have to be false at `(M₁, τ₁, 0)` and true at `(M₂, τ₂, 0)`; but the two
points are `stabCorr`-related, and `truthAt_of_truthCorr` transports every `Formula` along a
`TruthCorr`. So the two truth values coincide, and no `ψ` can separate what `⊡Fp` separates.
