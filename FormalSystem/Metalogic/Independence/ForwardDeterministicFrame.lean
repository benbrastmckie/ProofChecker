# `F^N` — forward-deterministic, not deterministic

The separating frame that shows `sent:det` defines only **forward** determinism:

```
W = ℕ                          D = ⟨ℤ, +, 0, ≤⟩
f(0) = 0,  f(n) = n − 1        w ⇒_n u  iff  u = fⁿ(w)  for n ≥ 0
                               (n < 0 by the converse convention)
```

`F^N` is Laplacian about the future and indeterminate about the past: the absorbing predecessor
map is a *semiflow*, not a flow. It is forward-deterministic — every `⇒_d` with `d ≥ 0` is a
function — and **not** `Deterministic`, because `fib(0, −1) = {0, 1}`.

## Main Definitions

- `fnRel` — the task relation, in the sign-symmetric `max`-form described below
- `FN` — `F^N` as a `TaskFrame`

## Main Results

- `fn_forwardDeterministic` — `FN.ForwardDeterministic`
- `fn_not_deterministic` — `¬ FN.Deterministic`
- `states_eq_of_forwardDeterministic` — the forward analogue of `states_eq_of_deterministic`:
  possible worlds agreeing at `x` agree at every `y ≥ x`, and **not** before `x`
- `fn_sentDet_atom` — `sent:det` at a sentence letter is valid over `FN`
- `fn_separates` — the separation: `sent:det` is valid over `FN` at every letter while `FN` is
  not deterministic, so no reading of `app:deterministic-future` may be strengthened to a
  characterization
- `fn_refutes_sentDet_somePast` — the *schematic* reading of that validity is **false**: `FN`
  refutes `sent:det` at the past-looking instance `P p`

## The relation is defined in a sign-symmetric `max`-form

Writing the relation as a case split on `sign d` makes `converse` a case analysis at every use
site. Instead:

```
fnRel w d u  :=  (u : ℤ) = max 0 ((w : ℤ) − d)  ∨  (w : ℤ) = max 0 ((u : ℤ) + d)
```

The two disjuncts are each other's reflection, so `converse` is literally `Or.comm`. And the
disjunction is not a weakening: for `d ≥ 0` the second disjunct is *contained in* the first (from
`u, d ≥ 0` it gives `w = u + d`, hence `u = w − d ≥ 0`, hence `u = max 0 (w − d)`), and for
`d ≤ 0` the first is contained in the second. So at each sign the disjunction collapses to the
intended clause — which is what `fn_rel_iff_of_nonneg` and `fn_rel_iff_of_nonpos` record.

## Why the carrier must be infinite

On a **finite** `W`, *Seriality* makes each `⇒_x` (`x ≥ 0`) surjective, and a surjective function
on a finite set is injective; so forward determinism already entails backward determinism there,
and no finite frame can separate the two notions. `W = ℕ` is not an incidental choice
(the PossibleWorlds determinism-axiom-correspondence report, §3.3, consequence 4).

## *Saturation* needs the finite-**fibres** helper

`cor:saturation-finite` (`TaskFrame.saturation_of_finite`) is the finite-**carrier** result and
does not apply: `ℕ` is infinite. `saturation_of_fib_subsingleton` does not apply either: the
negative-duration fibre `fib(0, −1) = {0, 1}` is not a subsingleton. What does apply is
`TaskFrame.saturation_of_fib_finite` (`Semantics/TaskFrame.lean`), landed for exactly this
consumer: every fibre of `fnRel` is contained in `Set.Iic (w + |d|)` and hence finite.

**The forward analogue of `states_eq_of_deterministic`.** On a forward-deterministic frame, two
possible worlds agreeing on their world state at `x` agree at every time `y ≥ x`.

This is `states_eq_of_deterministic`'s proof (`Semantics/PlusDeterminism.lean`) with the duration
`y - x` now **nonnegative**, which is exactly the instance the guarded binder supports. Note what
is *not* concluded: nothing about `y < x`, and `F^N`'s own two possible worlds
`τ ≡ 0` and `σ(n) = max(0, −n)` agree at `0` while differing at every negative time.

**`sent:det` at a sentence letter is valid over `F^N`.**

`sentDet_unfold`'s `∀ y > x` restriction is what makes the forward engine sufficient: at each
`y > x`, forward determinism gives `σ(y) = τ(y)` for every `σ ∈ ⟨τ⟩ₓ`, and an atom's truth
depends on nothing but the state at the time of evaluation. One disjunct of `settledDisj` then
holds outright.

**The separation.** `sent:det` is valid over `F^N` at every sentence letter, while `F^N` is not
deterministic. So no reading of `app:deterministic-future` may be strengthened to a
characterization of the deterministic frames: what `sent:det` defines is *forward* determinism.

Contrast `deterministic_starDefinable` (`Semantics/StarDeterminism.lean`), where replacing
`\Future` by `always` closes exactly this gap — `always` reaches the past, and the past is where
`F^N` is indeterminate.

Stated as one conjunction so that neither half can be read alone.

`lem:deterministic-singleton` genuinely requires the **bidirectional** reading of
`def:deterministic`.

Weakening `def:deterministic` to the guarded `0 ≤ d` binder would make `F^N` deterministic
(`fn_forwardDeterministic`) while `F^N` has a possible world whose stability class is not a
singleton — the frame is not deterministic in the real sense (`fn_not_deterministic`), so
`deterministic_iff_singletonClasses` would become false under that weakening. Recorded as a
statement rather than only as prose, since it is the reason `TaskFrame.Deterministic`'s
unrestricted binder is a correctness requirement (the PossibleWorlds
determinism-axiom-correspondence report, §3.3, consequence 2).

/-! ## The schematic reading of `fn_sentDet` is false

`fn_sentDet_atom` above is stated at a **sentence letter**, and that restriction is not a
convenience. The schematic form — `∀ φ : StarFormula, FN.StarValidOn (sentDet φ)` — is
**refutable**, and the two theorems below are the machine-checked refutation.

The reason is exactly the reason `F^N` exists: forward determinism settles the *future* and says
nothing about the past. `states_eq_of_forwardDeterministic` gives agreement at every `y ≥ x` and
at no earlier time, so a `φ` whose truth at `y` looks *backwards* — `P p`, say — can differ
between two possible worlds of `⟨τ⟩ₓ` at the very `y > x` that `sent:det` tests. That is what
`fnRampHist` and `fnZeroHist` witness: they agree at `0` and differ at every negative time.

The result this module transcribes (the PossibleWorlds determinism-axiom-correspondence
report, §3.2, Theorems A and B) is likewise
stated at the sentence-letter level: frame validity quantifies over all valuations, and the
argument runs the singleton valuation `|p| = {τ(y)}`. Nothing there claims, or needs, the
schematic form. -/

**The schematic reading of `sent:det`'s validity over `F^N` is false.**

`F^N` refutes `sent:det` at the past-looking instance `P p`: at `(τ, 0)` with register `2`
holding `1`, the ramp world `σ ∈ ⟨τ⟩₀` satisfies `P p` at time `1` (it was at state `3` at time
`−3`) while `τ ≡ 0` refutes it, so neither disjunct of `settledDisj` can hold.

This is what confines `fn_sentDet_atom` to sentence letters, and it is recorded as a theorem
rather than as prose because the distinction is easy to lose: `sentDet_of_deterministic`
**is** schematic (full determinism gives agreement at every time, past included), and only the
forward-deterministic case degrades.
