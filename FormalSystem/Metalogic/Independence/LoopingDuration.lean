# Looping durations, periodicity, and the validity of `CO`

The `CO`-validity half of the independence result uses the periodic clock frame only through a
single property, isolated here as `LoopingDuration`: a nonzero duration `π` whose task relation
is the identity, `w ⇒_π u ⟺ u = w`.

Three lemmas follow, each proved for an arbitrary frame carrying a looping duration:

* **Lemma A** (`states_add_of_looping`) — *history* periodicity. `def:world-history`'s
  task-respect clause, applied at the single pair `(x, x + π)`, already forces
  `τ(x + π) = τ(x)` for every total history. Nothing about `H_F` is needed.
* **Lemma B** (`truthAt_add_period`) — *truth* periodicity:
  `M,τ,t ⊨ φ ⟺ M,τ,t+π ⊨ φ`, by induction on `Formula`. The history is universally quantified
  *inside* the induction, which is what lets the `□` case — whose clause ranges over **all**
  total histories — apply the induction hypothesis at each of them.
* **Lemma C** (`allPast_imp_allFuture`, `co_true`) — over an Archimedean `D`, periodicity
  collapses past and future: `Hψ → Gψ` holds at every point, and hence every instance of `CO`
  is true at every point, for every `ψ`.

`allFuture_imp_allPast` records the past mirror `Gψ → Hψ`, which the same argument gives for
free and which the `temporal_duality` closure of `CoNotPriorU.lean` consumes.

The clock frame instantiates all of this at `π = 1`: see `clockFrame_looping` and
`clock_co_true` at the end of the file.

/-! ## Looping durations -/

/--
`π` is a **looping duration** of `F`: a nonzero duration whose task relation is the identity.

The clock frame's circumference `1` is one, and it is the only property of the clock frame that
the `CO`-validity argument uses.

  π ≠ 0 ∧ ∀ w u, F.TaskRel w π u ↔ u = w

/-- The negation of a looping duration is a looping duration, by the converse convention. -/

    LoopingDuration F (-π) := by
  refine ⟨neg_ne_zero.mpr h.1, fun w u => ?_⟩
  have hconv := F.converse w (-π) u
  rw [neg_neg] at hconv
  exact hconv.trans ((h.2 u w).trans eq_comm)

/-- A frame with a looping duration has a **positive** one. -/

  · exact absurd heq h.1
  · exact ⟨π, hgt, h⟩

/-! ## Lemma A — history periodicity -/

/--
**Lemma A.** A looping duration makes every total history periodic.

This is forced by `def:world-history`'s task-respect clause alone, applied at the single pair of
times `(x, x + π)`: the clause hands over `τ(x) ⇒_π τ(x + π)`, and a looping duration relates a
state only to itself.
-/

    (τ : ConvexHistory F) (hτ : τ.IsTotal) (x : ↑D) :
    τ.states (x + π) (hτ (x + π)) = τ.states x (hτ x) := by
  have hr := τ.respects_task x (x + π) (hτ x) (hτ (x + π))
  have hd : x + π - x = π := by abel
  rw [hd] at hr
  exact (h.2 _ _).mp hr

/-! ## Lemma B — truth periodicity -/

/--
**The looping-duration truth isomorphism.**

`dur` is translation by `π`, `hist` is the identity on `H_F` — a looping duration reindexes
times, not histories — and `atom` is `states_add_of_looping`. Everything else about Lemma B is
`Truth.truthAt_of_truthIso`'s six-case induction, run once and shared.

The period must be **frame-uniform** (`LoopingDuration F π` is a property of the frame, not of a
history) and that is not an artefact of this packaging: `TruthIso.atom` is quantified over every
total history because `TruthAt`'s `box` clause is. Contrast
`Semantics.Correspondence.FwdRecPeriodicity.truthAt_add_hist_period`, whose period belongs to one
history and which therefore cannot be an instance of this structure; its own docstring records
why.

  dur := OrderIso.addRight π

  atom := fun τ t p => by
    show M.valuation (τ.val.states t (τ.property t)) p ↔
      M.valuation (τ.val.states (t + π) (τ.property (t + π))) p
    rw [states_add_of_looping h τ.val τ.property t]

/--
**Lemma B.** Truth is `π`-periodic in time, for every formula, at every total history.

An instantiation of `Truth.truthAt_of_truthIso` at `loopingTruthIso`, replacing the 68-line
hand-written six-case induction this used to carry. The statement is unchanged, including its
quantification of the history **inside** the theorem — which is essential and not stylistic,
since the `□` clause of `TruthAt` ranges over all total histories and the induction hypothesis
has to be available at each of them. That requirement is now discharged once, inside
`truthAt_of_truthIso`, rather than restated here.

/-! ## Lemma C — `CO` is true everywhere -/

/--
**Lemma C.** Over an Archimedean duration order, a looping duration collapses `H` into `G`:
if `ψ` holds at every past time then it holds at every future time.

Given a future point `s`, the Archimedean property supplies a whole number of loops carrying `s`
strictly below `t`. `ψ` holds there because `Hψ` does, and Lemma B carries it back up to `s`.

`Formula.co ψ = △(Hψ → F(Hψ)) → (Hψ → Gψ)`, and the consequent is already valid here by
Lemma C, so the antecedent is discarded.
