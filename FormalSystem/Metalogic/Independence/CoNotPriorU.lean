# `CO` does not derive Prior-U

The paper's `CO` principle (`Formula.co`, `△(Hφ → F(Hφ)) → (Hφ → Gφ)`) is a *theorem* over the
Reynolds Dedekind triple — that direction is `FormalSystem.Theorems.DedekindDerived.coDerived`.
This file establishes the converse **failure**: over the dense base, `CO` does not derive
`Axiom.prior_U_gap`.

## The witness

The countermodel is the periodic clock frame of `ClockFrame.lean` carrying the *symmetric
irrational arc* valuation: an atom is true at a circle point exactly when that point has a
representative within `α := √2 / 4` of `0`. Since `α` is irrational and `0 < α < 1/2`, the arc has
no rational endpoint, and `Axiom.prior_U_gap` — which asserts that a `φ`-region reached from the
present has a *definable* upper endpoint — fails at time `0` along the reference history. Every
`CO` instance is nonetheless true everywhere, by `LoopingDuration.lean`'s Lemma C.

## Why this is a statement about a model, not a frame

`def:frame-validity` quantifies over **all** valuations. On a densely ordered flow rich enough to
realize an arbitrary set of times, frame-validity of `CO` already forces gap-freeness, and hence
forces Prior-U valid too — so no frame-level countermodel can exist, for any frame whatever. The
theorem therefore has to be stated over a **fixed** `TaskModel`, which is exactly the shape of
Reynolds' own printed caveat (1992, p.169): the gap axioms enforce only a *definably*
Dedekind-complete flow, "there may be gaps in the order but ... you wouldn't know that just
looking at the behaviour of temporal formulas".

## Pre-empting the "degenerate model" objection

The clock model validates `Hψ → Gψ`, which the intended reading of the logic does not. That is
expected of an independence witness and does not weaken the result: the underlying frame
discharges all four of `def:frame`'s axioms (see `ClockFrame.lean`), `ℚ` is densely ordered, and
therefore every base and density axiom is true in this model for free by `soundness_dense`. The
only principle assumed beyond the dense base is `CO` itself.

## The refuted predecessor sketch

An earlier pen-and-paper sketch (recorded in `Axioms.lean`'s Layer 9 and corrected there) proposed
a ℚ-flow with isolated `¬φ` points accumulating at an irrational from above. That witness is
**refuted**, not merely unverified: in it, `ξ := ¬U(¬p, p) ∧ F(U(¬p, p))` has truth set
`{t : t < √2}`, so `ξ` *defines the cut* and `CO(ξ)` is false at `0`. Hiding an accumulation point
does not work — some `U`/`S` formula always recovers the cut. What works instead is
**homogeneity**: the clock frame's time translation by `1` fixes every world state, so no formula
can see a distinguished time at all.

**Membership fact 3** — the substantive one: the consequent `U(¬p ∨ K⁺(¬p), p)` fails at `0`.

No rational `s > 0` can serve as a witness. If `s` overshoots the arc (`α < s`) then density of ℚ
puts a rational in the gap `(α, 1 - α)` below `s`, where `p` is false, so the guard fails. If `s`
falls short (`s < α` — equality is impossible, `α` being irrational) then `p` is true at `s`, so
`¬p` fails there, and any rational in `(s, α)` witnesses `U(⊤, ¬¬p)` at `s`, so `K⁺(¬p)` fails
there too; the event disjunction is therefore false at `s`.

/-! ## Statement S1 — the context form -/

/--
**`CO` does not derive Prior-U (context form).**

Over the dense base, no context of `CO` instances derives `Axiom.prior_U_gap p`. Since a context
is a finite list and every derivation is finite, this already says: *no finite set of `CO`
instances, together with the dense base, derives Prior-U.*

**What is and is not claimed.**

* Claimed: `FrameClass.Dense`'s axioms plus finitely many `CO` instances as assumptions do not
  derive `priorUGapFormula p`. The witness is `clockModel` at `clockHistory`, time `0`.
* Also claimed, and strictly stronger: the schema-level statement
  `co_not_derives_prior_U_gap_schema` below, which closes the gap left by this one — a context
  cannot appear under `necessitation`, `temporal_necessitation` or `temporal_duality`, since
  `DerivationTree`'s rule constructors are restricted to the empty context.
* **Not** claimed, and in fact false: any *frame*-level statement. `def:frame-validity`
  quantifies over all valuations, and under that quantifier frame-validity of `CO` on a dense
  flow forces gap-freeness and hence Prior-U. See this module's docstring.

/-! ## The time-reversal mirror

`temporal_duality` (`⊢ φ` gives `⊢ φ.swapTemporal`) is the one closure rule whose soundness over a
*fixed* model is not automatic: it needs the model to be isomorphic to its own time reversal. The
clock model is, and that is precisely why the arc was centred at `0`: negation `w ↦ -w` is an
automorphism of the circle that preserves the arc and reverses durations. An asymmetric arc would
break this, and must not be substituted.

An instantiation of `Truth.truthAt_of_truthAntiIso` at `clockMirrorIso`, replacing the 80-line
hand-written six-case induction this used to carry. The statement is unchanged, relational form
included: it still quantifies over a *pair* of histories tied by the reversal equation rather
than over `reflect` alone. Collapsing the pair to `reflect` is now one extensionality step,
where before it was what made the `□` case work in both directions — that job has moved into
`TruthAntiIso.hist` being an honest equivalence.

/-! ## Statement S2 — the CO-closed derivation system -/

/--
The **`CO`-closed schema system**: the dense base, every instance of `CO`, and closure under
every rule of `DerivationTree` that the empty-context schema form admits.

`DerivationTree`'s `necessitation`, `temporal_necessitation` and `temporal_duality` constructors
all require `Γ = []`, so no `CO` instance supplied as a *context* can ever appear under them. That
is exactly the gap `co_not_derives_prior_U_gap` leaves open and this system closes: here the `CO`
instances are axioms of the system, not assumptions, so they sit under every rule.

`assumption` and `weakening` are absent because they are context rules with nothing to act on in
the schema form. `temporal_duality` is present and must stay present: dropping it would silently
weaken what the theorem below claims.

**Soundness of the `CO`-closed system over the arc model.**

The axiom case is `soundness_dense` applied to the one-step derivation; the `co` case is
`LoopingDuration.lean`'s Lemma C; `temporal_duality` is the mirror lemma. The conclusion is
universally quantified over the history and the time, which is what the three rule cases need.

/--
**`CO` does not derive Prior-U (schema form).** The unqualified statement.

There is no derivation of `Axiom.prior_U_gap p` in the system consisting of the dense base, the
whole `CO` schema, modus ponens, modal and temporal necessitation, and temporal duality. Unlike
`co_not_derives_prior_U_gap`, this leaves no residue: the `CO` instances here are axioms, so they
are available under every rule, including the three that `DerivationTree` restricts to the empty
context.

Still not claimed, and still false, is any *frame*-level statement — see this module's docstring.
