# F¹ — the deterministic translation flow over `ℝ`

The first half of the **indistinguishable pair** behind `cor:no-characterization`. `F¹` has
`W = D = ℝ` and the functional task relation `w ⇒_x u :⟺ u = w + x`: a single translation flow,
deterministic in the sense of `def:deterministic`. Its partner `F°` — the *drift* frame of
`app:drift`, non-deterministic, with the same `ℝ` carrier — is in `Independence/DriftFrame.lean`.

## Main Definitions

- `realTemporalOrder` — `ℝ` as a `TemporalOrder`
- `oneShift` — the shift set `(ℝ, +)` acting on itself
- `F1` — the induced task frame, `oneShift.frame`

## Main Results

- `f1_taskRel_iff` — the task relation is `u = w + x`, on the nose
- `f1_deterministic` — `F1` satisfies `TaskFrame.Deterministic`
- `f1_total_eq_orbit`, `f1_states_eq`, `f1_states_eq_of_states_eq` — the **world-set
  characterization**: the total histories of `F¹` are exactly the translations `τ(t) = τ(0) + t`
- `f1_determined` — *Determined* is valid on `F¹`, by Phase 1's collapse

## Why `ShiftSet` and not `translationFrame`

`Semantics/Frames/Standard.lean` already carries `translationFrame D`, which is this frame at
`D = realTemporalOrder`. It is nevertheless **not** the route taken here, and the reason is a
reducibility barrier that bites late rather than early.

`translationFrame` is a plain `def`, not `@[reducible]`, so
`(translationFrame realTemporalOrder).WorldState` does not reduce to `ℝ` at the transparency instance
synthesis and unification work at. There are two distinct symptoms:

1. **At the frame level**, `example (w x u : ℝ) : F1.TaskRel w x u ↔ u = w + x := Iff.rfl` fails
   with "`w` has type `ℝ` but is expected to have type `F1.WorldState`" and a failed
   `HAdd ℝ ℝ ?m` synthesis. This one *is* repairable: type the variables at `↑realTemporalOrder` instead
   of at `ℝ`, since `realTemporalOrder` is `@[reducible]` and `↑realTemporalOrder` does reduce.
2. **At the history level**, the world-set characterization
   `τ.states r _ = τ.states 0 _ + r` fails with a failed
   `HAdd (translationFrame realTemporalOrder).toTaskFrame.WorldState realTemporalOrder.carrier ?m` synthesis,
   because `τ.states` *returns* a value in the unreduced `WorldState`. This one is **not**
   repairable by a type ascription or by a `@[reducible]` alias: the barrier sits inside
   `translationFrame`'s own body, and neither reaches it.

`cor:no-characterization`'s `F¹` half is entirely about histories, so symptom 2 is fatal to that
route. `ShiftSet.fibre` and `ShiftSet.frame` are both `@[reducible]`, so the carrier stays
transparent all the way through — and the route additionally hands over `total_eq_orbit`, which
*is* the world-set characterization, already proved generically.

A bespoke `FrameOver realTemporalOrder` with a hand-written `foneRel` and six hand-discharged axiom
fields was also built during research and is **deliberately not promoted**: it duplicates
`ShiftSet.fibre` for no gain. It should not be restored.

## `realTemporalOrder` is defined here rather than imported

`Metalogic/DedekindNonCompactness.lean` already defines a `realTemporalOrder`, with `@[reducible]` and
`noncomputable` both load-bearing for exactly the reasons recorded at that declaration; this is a
second copy of that two-line definition rather than an import, and the duplication is deliberate:

- **Not imported from `DedekindNonCompactness`**, because that module imports
  `Metalogic.StrongCompleteness` — the entire completeness development — which is far too heavy a
  dependency for a frame-construction module.
- **Not lifted into `Semantics/`**, because that would pull `Mathlib.Data.Real.Basic` into the
  most upstream layer of the tree, where nothing else needs it.

## On `ShiftSet`'s valuation field

`ShiftSet` bundles a valuation `A` alongside the action, and `ShiftSet.model` reads it off. That
model is **not used anywhere in this development**: L⋆ frame validity quantifies over *all*
`TaskModel`s over the frame, so routing anything through `S.model` would prove a strictly weaker
statement. Only `oneShift.frame` is consumed. The valuation field is discharged with the constant
`False` purely to satisfy the structure.

`(ℝ, +)` acting on itself by translation, as a `ShiftSet`.

`sep` is the only field with content — it is the paper's *Limit* clause. Given that `u` lies
within every positive distance of `w`, instantiate the hypothesis at `x := |u - w|`; the
witness `y` is forced to be `u - w`, giving `|u - w| < |u - w|`. The same three lines as
`rShift`'s `sep`.
