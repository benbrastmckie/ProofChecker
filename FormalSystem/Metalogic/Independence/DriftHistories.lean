# F°'s total histories are order-isomorphisms of `(ℝ, <)`

`app:drift`'s key lemma, and the reason `F°` is indistinguishable from the deterministic `F¹`
despite not being deterministic: although the drift relation is a *band*, any single total
history through it is a strictly increasing bi-Lipschitz bijection of `ℝ` onto `ℝ`. So each
history, taken on its own, sees exactly the order structure a translation history sees.

The content is proved first on a bare state function `f : ℝ → ℝ` satisfying
`∀ s t, fzeroRel (f s) (t - s) (f t)` — which is what a total history's `states` field collapses
to, `hf` being exactly `respects_task` — and then lifted to `WorldHistory F0`, in the shape
`Independence/OrderTransfer.lean`'s hypotheses (H1) and (H2) demand.

## Main Results

- `fzero_bounds` — the drift inequality `t - s ≤ f t - f s ≤ 2 (t - s)` for `s ≤ t`
- `fzero_lipschitz`, `fzero_continuous` — `2`-Lipschitz, hence continuous
- `fzero_strictMono` — strictly increasing, from the lower drift bound alone
- `fzero_hits_future`, `fzero_hits_past` — **surjectivity**, the expensive half
- `fzero_orderFlow : OrderFlow F0` — (H1) discharged
- `fzero_stateOccurs : StateOccurs F0` — (H2) discharged, by an **explicit** witness

## The crux, and why it is where the work is

`fzero_hits_future` is `app:drift`'s key lemma and its expensive part. Given `f x < v`, put
`a := x + (v - f x)/2` and `b := x + (v - f x)`. The upper drift bound at `a` gives `f a ≤ v` and
the lower bound at `b` gives `v ≤ f b`, so `v` lies between two attained values; the function is
Lipschitz, hence continuous, so `intermediate_value_Icc` produces the witness. The bracket
`[d, 2d]` is exactly what makes both endpoint estimates come out — a narrower or wider band would
break one of them. This derivation was independently corroborated by a second derivation before
being promoted.

## Choice-freeness of (H2)

`StateOccurs` says every state is occupied at every time. The general theorem to that effect
(`cor:occurrence`) runs through `thm:extension` and hence Zorn. Nothing of the sort is needed
here: the translation `δ(t) := t + w - x` is *itself* a total history of `F°` — its increments
are `t - s`, which lies in the band `[t - s, 2(t - s)]` at its own left endpoint — and it has
state `w` at time `x`. That explicit witness is what keeps `cor:no-characterization` choice-free.
