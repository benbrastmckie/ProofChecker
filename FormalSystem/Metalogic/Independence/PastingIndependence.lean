# The two pasting axioms are not derivable from the naive `⊡`-set

`pasteNotNaiveDerivable` and `untlPasteNotNaiveDerivable`: PS and US are **not** theorems of TM
together with the six S5/bridge schemata {SK, ST, S4, S5, MS, AS}. The axiom set of TM⁺
(`PlusLanguage/Axioms.lean`) is therefore non-redundant — its docstring's claim that the S5 set
"alone is provably incomplete" is now machine-checked.

## The refuting model

One coarsened-state model (`Metalogic/Independence/CoarsenedModels.lean`) refutes both:

* **Frame** — the deterministic clock over `ℤ` at a one-element family index,
  `multiFamTaskFrameGen (TemporalOrder.of ℤ) Unit`. Its total histories are exactly the flow
  lines `t ↦ ((), w₀ + t)`, one per offset `w₀ : ℤ` (`pTotal_toHist`).
* **Valuation** — every atom is true at the states whose clock reads `0`, so along the flow line
  of offset `w₀` the atom holds at exactly the time `-w₀`.
* **Coarsening** — `π ((), x) = |x|`, which identifies the offsets `w₀` and `-w₀` and is
  atom-invariant because `|x| = |y|` and `x = 0` force `y = 0`.

The point of evaluation is `(pHist (-1), 0)`. Its `π`-class contains exactly two flow lines,
those of offset `-1` and `+1`:

| line | `Fp` at time `0` | `Pp` at time `0` |
|---|---|---|
| `pHist (-1)` — atom at time `1` | **yes** | no |
| `pHist 1` — atom at time `-1` | no | **yes** |

So `⟐Fp` and `⟐Pp` both hold, while `⟐(Fp ∧ Pp)` fails — indeed `Fp ∧ Pp` is false at *every*
point of this model, since the atom holds at exactly one time on each line. That is PS refuted.
US is refuted at the same point with `α := ⊤` and `φ⁺ := Fp`: the antecedent `F⟐Fp` holds
(at time `2` the class of `pHist (-1)` contains the line of offset `-3`, whose atom is still
ahead), while the consequent `⟐FFp` fails, because neither line of the class at time `0` admits
a strictly intermediate time before its atom.

## Why the coarsening is what does the work

On a genuine task frame PS and US are **valid** (`Semantics/PlusPasting.lean`): the splice of
two total histories through a common state is again a total history. Coarsening breaks exactly
that, and nothing else — the two lines above pass through *different* states at time `0`, so
there is no state for a splice to run through. Everything else about the model is ordinary.

## Nothing here weakens TM⁺

The pasting axioms remain valid on every task frame; these theorems say only that the *naive*
system cannot prove them, which is why TM⁺ carries them as axioms. The live `PlusAxiom` is
unchanged, and `NaiveDerivable` is a predicate on the existing derivation trees
(`Metalogic/Independence/NaiveSystem.lean`), not a second proof system.

## Main Results

- `pasteNotNaiveDerivable` — PS is not naively derivable
- `untlPasteNotNaiveDerivable` — US is not naively derivable

* `FormalSystem/PlusLanguage/Axioms.lean` — the docstring this result discharges
