# Non-compactness of the `FrameClass.Discrete` consequence relation

This module discharges the informal argument recorded in `Metalogic/StrongCompleteness.lean`'s
module docstring: the set-based semantic consequence relation for `FrameClass.Discrete` is **not
compact**, so genuine strong completeness is unavailable for that class.

## The witness

Fix an atom `p`. The premise set is

  `archWitness p = {F p} ∪ {¬Xⁿ p : n ∈ ℕ}`

where `X φ = Formula.next φ = Formula.untl Formula.bot φ` is the next-step operator (the `untl`
constructor is **guard-first**: `next φ` is `untl (guard := ⊥) (event := φ)`).

* **Every finite subset is satisfiable.** A finite list `L` of members mentions only finitely
  many `Xⁿ`, so a threshold `N` bounds them all; over `ℤ` place `p` strictly beyond `N` and
  evaluate at `0`. Then `F p` holds (the witness sits at `N + 1`) and every `¬Xⁿ p` in `L` holds
  because `n ≤ N`.
* **The whole set is unsatisfiable.** Over any Archimedean discrete carrier, an `F p` witness
  `s > t` is reachable from `t` in finitely many successor steps — this is exactly where
  `IsSuccArchimedean` does its work — so `Xⁿ⁺¹ p` holds at `t` for that `n`, contradicting the
  corresponding `¬Xⁿ⁺¹ p`.

Together these refute `CompactZTime` (`notCompactZTime`) and, by way of
`soundness_ztime`, `StrongCompletenessZTime` itself
(`notStrongCompletenessZTime`). Both statements are declared in
`Metalogic/SetConsequence.lean`.

## Note on `truthAt_next_iff` / `truthAt_next_iterate`

These two lemmas are pure semantics with no completeness content, and are the first semantic
characterisation of `Formula.next` anywhere in this development. Their natural eventual home is
the `Truth` namespace of `FormalSystem/Semantics/Truth.lean`, beside `some_future_iff`,
`future_iff` and `past_iff`; the needed `SuccOrder`/`NoMaxOrder` are already in scope there. They
are kept here for now because `Truth.lean` sits near the root of the import graph and this module
is their only consumer — promotion is the right move once a second consumer appears.

They are deliberately **not** `@[simp]`: were they promoted upstream, a simp-normal `next`
rewrite would fire inside the proof-theoretic reasoning in `Theorems/DiscreteUnfolding.lean`.

/-- **Semantic characterisation of `Formula.next`.** On a discrete order with no maximum,
    `X φ` holds at `t` exactly when `φ` holds at `Order.succ t`.

    Unfolding the `untl` clause of `TruthAt`, `TruthAt t (next φ)` reads
    `∃ s > t, φ(s) ∧ ∀ r ∈ (t, s), ⊥` — the empty-gap condition forces `s = Order.succ t`. -/

/-! ## The witness set and its index function -/

/-- The non-compactness witness set for the atom `p`:

      `{F p} ∪ {¬Xⁿ p : n ∈ ℕ}`

    Every finite subset is satisfiable over `ℤ` (`archWitness_finitely_satisfiable`); the whole
    set is satisfiable over no Archimedean discrete carrier (`archWitness_not_satisfiable`). -/
def archWitness (p : Atom) : Set Formula :=
  {(Formula.atom p).someFuture} ∪ {ψ | ∃ n : ℕ, ψ = (Formula.next^[n] (Formula.atom p)).neg}

/-- **Membership in `archWitness`, unfolded once and for all.** The set is a singleton unioned
with a `setOf`, so every membership goal against it used to be discharged by the same
`simp only [archWitness, Set.mem_union, Set.mem_singleton_iff, Set.mem_setOf_eq]` incantation,
written out at each site. Tagging the unfolding `@[simp]` retires the incantation: a plain
`simp` now both introduces and eliminates membership. The Dedekind module carries the
corresponding `mem_dedWitness_iff`. -/
@[simp] theorem mem_archWitness_iff {p : Atom} {ψ : Formula} :
    ψ ∈ archWitness p ↔ ψ = (Formula.atom p).someFuture ∨
      ∃ n : ℕ, ψ = (Formula.next^[n] (Formula.atom p)).neg := by
  simp only [archWitness, Set.mem_union, Set.mem_singleton_iff, Set.mem_setOf_eq]

/-- Number of leading `Formula.next` layers of a formula.

    The first equation matches `Formula.untl Formula.bot φ` — **guard-first**, matching
    `Formula.next`'s definition (`Syntax/Formula.lean`). Written with the arguments swapped it
    would silently never fire and the function would be constantly `0`. -/
def nextDepth : Formula → ℕ
  | Formula.untl Formula.bot φ => nextDepth φ + 1
  | _ => 0

/-- The index `n` recovered from a witness element `¬Xⁿ p` (which is `Formula.imp (Xⁿ p) ⊥`).

    **Why this exists.** `archWitness_finitely_satisfiable` receives an arbitrary
    `L : List Formula` whose members lie in `archWitness p`, and must produce a *single*
    threshold beyond which to place `p`. Membership only supplies `∃ n, ψ = ¬Xⁿ p` element by
    element; `witIdx` turns that existential into a computable index, so the threshold can be
    taken as a sum (hence an upper bound) over `L`.

    `Formula.complexity` (`Syntax/Formula.lean`) is **not** usable for this. It is pattern-aware
    — it special-cases the `always` / `sometimes` / `weakFuture` / `weakPast` expansions and
    charges them overhead — so it is not a monotone structural size and yields no usable bound. -/

/-! ## The `ℤ` model witnessing finite satisfiability

`FrameOver.natFrame` (`Semantics/TaskFrame.lean`) is the right frame off the shelf: its relation
`TaskRel w d u := d ≠ 0 ∨ w = u` is permissive, so an **arbitrary** state function respects it —
which is exactly what the non-constant history below needs. `WorldHistory.universalNatFrame` is
constant-state and so cannot separate the times; `staticFrame` is worse still, its relation
forcing constant histories outright.

  domain := fun _ => True

  convex := fun _ _ _ _ _ _ _ => True.intro

/-- The model over `natFrame` whose only true atom-condition is "the world-state is `1`".

    The **lambda binder** carries the `Nat` annotation; `fun w _ => (w : Nat) = 1` does not
    elaborate, since ascribing an existing fvar does not retarget numeral elaboration. -/

/-- **`archWitness p` is satisfiable over no Archimedean discrete carrier.** The `F p` witness
    `s > t` is reachable from `t` in finitely many successor steps — this is exactly where
    `IsSuccArchimedean` does its work, via
    `(Order.succ_le_of_lt hts).exists_succ_iterate`, the idiom already used throughout
    `SoundnessLemmas/FrameClassVariants.lean`. That contradicts the corresponding `¬Xⁿ⁺¹ p`.

    The existential is destructured with **bare `_` instance binders** so that synthesis recovers
    the originals. Naming them and re-installing with `haveI` would drop the value and break
    definitional equality with the instances baked into `F`'s and `M`'s types. -/

/-- **The `FrameClass.Discrete` consequence relation is not compact.**

`not_compact_of_witness` (`Metalogic/StrongCompleteness.lean`) at `archWitness ⟨"p", none⟩`. The
two halves it consumes are the two acceptance theorems directly above: `archWitness` is finitely
satisfiable over `ℤ`, and satisfiable over no Archimedean discrete carrier at all.

The argument the skeleton runs — `archWitness p ⊨ ⊥` holds vacuously, compactness hands back a
finite `L` with `L.foldr imp ⊥` Discrete-valid, and `truthAt_foldr_imp` contradicts that against
a Discrete model of the same `L` — used to be written out here in full, and again in
`Metalogic/DedekindNonCompactness.lean` with a different witness. It is now written once. -/

`not_strongCompleteness_of_witness` at the same witness, on the same two acceptance theorems.

**This proof no longer mentions `soundness_ztime`.** The skeleton routes through
`compact_of_strongCompleteness`, whose soundness step is the class-generic `soundness_validIn`;
the per-class soundness corollary is no longer on the refutation path. With it went the
bare-instance-binder `rintro ⟨F, ⟨_,_,_,_⟩, M, τ, hτ, t, hsat⟩` discipline this proof used to
need, since it no longer destructures a `SatisfiableZTimeSet` witness itself —
`archWitness_not_satisfiable` above still does, and still documents the discipline.

This is the theorem behind the module docstring claim in `Metalogic/StrongCompleteness.lean`
that only weak completeness is available for this class. -/
theorem notStrongCompletenessZTime : ¬ StrongCompletenessZTime :=

    (archWitness_not_satisfiable ⟨"p", none⟩)

#print axioms notCompactZTime

/-! ## Axiom Audit

`#print axioms notCompactZTime` above is the only in-file directive this module keeps: it is
one of the five termini named in the C2/C14 manifest contract. **The rest of this module's
axiom audit lives in `scripts/check-module-invariants.sh`'s C14 heredoc pair**, which pins
`truthAt_next_iff`, `truthAt_next_iterate`, `archWitness_finitely_satisfiable`,
`archWitness_not_satisfiable` and `notStrongCompletenessZTime` by exact string equality
against a recorded baseline. That is a stronger guarantee than the hand-transcribed output block
that used to sit here, which could and did drift out of step with the declarations it claimed to
report.

**`sorryAx`-free throughout.** Every declaration in this module carries exactly the three
standard classical axioms, the identical set already carried by `completeness_dense`,
`completeness_ztime` and `consequence_completeness_rtime`. No new axiom is introduced and
no obligation is deferred.

### Axiom classification

* `propext` — propositional extensionality, entering through `simp`/`omega` normalisation.
* `Classical.choice` — via the `classical` tactic and Mathlib's order-theoretic lemmas
  (`Order.succ_le_of_lt`, `IsSuccArchimedean.exists_succ_iterate`).
* `Quot.sound` — quotient soundness, entering through Mathlib's `List` and `Int` API.

None of the three is avoidable in this development, and none is specific to this module.
