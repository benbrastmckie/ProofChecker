# Deduction Theorem - Hilbert System Deduction Infrastructure

This module proves the deduction theorem for the TM logic Hilbert system.

## Main Results

- `deductionAxiom`: If φ is an axiom, then `Γ ⊢ A → φ`
- `deductionAssumptionSame`: `Γ ⊢ A → A` (identity)
- `deductionAssumptionOther`: If `B ∈ Γ`, then `Γ ⊢ A → B`
- `deductionMp`: Modus ponens under implication
- `deductionTheorem`: If `A :: Γ ⊢ B` then `Γ ⊢ A → B`
- `deductionConverse`: If `Γ ⊢ A → B` then `A :: Γ ⊢ B` (computable)
- `Derivable.deduction`: Prop-level deduction theorem for `Derivable`

## Overview

The deduction theorem is moved into the Core layer as a foundational result needed
by higher layers, particularly for MCS properties.

## Implementation Notes

The deduction theorem for Hilbert systems requires induction on the derivation structure.
We handle each case of the Derivable relation:
- Base case: axiom
- Base case: assumption (splits into same vs other)
- Inductive case: modus ponens
- Inductive case: weakening (reduces to subderivation)
- Modal/temporal K rules and temporal duality do not apply with non-empty contexts

/-! ## Helper Lemmas -/

/--
Helper: Apply implication introduction pattern.
If `⊢ φ` then `⊢ A → φ` for any A.

This uses the S axiom (weakening): `φ → (A → φ)`.

  have s_ax : ⊢[fc] φ.imp (A.imp φ) := DerivationTree.axiom [] _ (Axiom.prop_s φ A) trivial
  exact DerivationTree.modus_ponens [] φ (A.imp φ) s_ax h

/--
Helper: Lift weakening to contexts.
If `Γ ⊢ φ` then `Γ ⊢ A → φ` for formulas φ that are axioms.
-/
private def weakenUnderImpCtx {fc : FrameClass} {Γ : Context} {φ A : Formula}
    (h : Axiom φ) (h_fc : h.minFrameClass ≤ fc) : Γ ⊢[fc] A.imp φ := by

  have weakened : ⊢[fc] A.imp φ := weakenUnderImp ax_deriv
  exact DerivationTree.weakening [] Γ (A.imp φ) weakened (List.nil_subset Γ)

/--
Exchange lemma: Derivability is preserved under context permutation.

If `Γ ⊢ φ` and `Γ'` is a permutation of `Γ` (same elements, different order),
then `Γ' ⊢ φ`.

This is proven by showing that both `Γ ⊆ Γ'` and `Γ' ⊆ Γ` when they have
the same elements, then using weakening.

Helper: Remove an element from a list.

Returns the list with all occurrences of `a` removed.

private def removeAll {α : Type _} [DecidableEq α] (l : List α) (a : α) : List α :=
  l.filter (· ≠ a)

/--
Helper: If `A ∈ Γ'` and `Γ' ⊆ A :: Γ`, then `removeAll Γ' A ⊆ Γ`.

This shows that removing A from Γ' gives a subset of Γ.

Helper: If `A ∈ Γ'`, then `A :: removeAll Γ' A` has the same elements as `Γ'`.

This shows that we can move A to the front of the list.

/-! ## Deduction Theorem Cases -/

/--
Deduction case for axioms: If φ is an axiom, then `Γ ⊢ A → φ`.

**Strategy**: Use S axiom to weaken φ under implication A.
-/
def deductionAxiom {fc : FrameClass} (Γ : Context) (A φ : Formula) (h_ax : Axiom φ)
    (h_fc : h_ax.minFrameClass ≤ fc) :
    Γ ⊢[fc] A.imp φ := by
  exact weakenUnderImpCtx h_ax h_fc

/--
Deduction case for same assumption: `Γ ⊢ A → A`.

**Strategy**: Use identity theorem (already proven in Perpetuity.lean).
-/

  exact DerivationTree.weakening [] Γ (A.imp A) id_fc (List.nil_subset Γ)

/--
Deduction case for other assumptions: If `B ∈ Γ`, then `Γ ⊢ A → B`.

**Strategy**: Use S axiom to weaken assumption B under implication A.
-/
def deductionAssumptionOther {fc : FrameClass} (Γ : Context) (A B : Formula)
    (h_mem : B ∈ Γ) : Γ ⊢[fc] A.imp B := by

/--
Deduction case for modus ponens:
If `Γ ⊢ A → (C → D)` and `Γ ⊢ A → C` then `Γ ⊢ A → D`.

**Strategy**: Use K axiom distribution: `(A → C → D) → ((A → C) → (A → D))`.
-/
def deductionMp {fc : FrameClass} (Γ : Context) (A C D : Formula)
    (h1 : Γ ⊢[fc] A.imp (C.imp D))

    Γ ⊢[fc] A.imp D := by
  -- K axiom: (A → C → D) → ((A → C) → (A → D))
  have k_ax : ⊢[fc] (A.imp (C.imp D)).imp ((A.imp C).imp (A.imp D)) :=

  exact DerivationTree.modus_ponens Γ (A.imp C) (A.imp D) step1 h2

/--
Deduction theorem for contexts where A appears in the middle.

If `Γ' ⊢ φ` and `A ∈ Γ'`, then `(removeAll Γ' A) ⊢ A → φ`.

This is the key lemma for handling the weakening case where A appears in Γ'
but not at the front. By recursing on the structure of the derivation (not using
exchange), all recursive calls have strictly smaller height.

/-! ## Main Deduction Theorem -/

/--
The Deduction Theorem: If `A :: Γ ⊢ B` then `Γ ⊢ A → B`.

This fundamental metatheorem allows converting derivations with assumptions
into implicational theorems.

**Proof Strategy**: Well-founded recursion on derivation height.
- Axiom case: Use S axiom to weaken
- Assumption case: Identity if same, S axiom if different
- Modus ponens case: Use K axiom distribution with recursive calls
- Weakening case: Handle three subcases:
  1. `Γ' = A :: Γ`: Apply recursion directly
  2. `A ∉ Γ'`: Use S axiom (A not needed)
  3. `A ∈ Γ'` but `Γ' ≠ A :: Γ`: Use recursion on permuted context (KEY CASE)
- Modal/temporal necessitation: Cannot occur (require empty context)
- Temporal duality: Cannot occur (requires empty context)

**Well-Founded Recursion**: The recursion terminates because:
- In modus ponens: both subderivations have strictly smaller height
- In weakening: the subderivation has strictly smaller height
- All recursive calls are on derivations with smaller height

**Complexity**: Core metatheorem for Hilbert systems. Uses well-founded recursion
to handle the complex weakening case where A appears in the middle of the context.

/-! ## Converse and Prop-Level Corollaries -/

/--
Converse of the deduction theorem: if `Γ ⊢ A → B` then `(A :: Γ) ⊢ B`.

Unlike `deductionTheorem`, this direction is **computable**: it is a direct
composition of weakening (to bring `h` into the extended context), the
assumption rule (to obtain `A` at the head), and modus ponens. No recursion
on the derivation tree is needed, so no `noncomputable` marker is required.
-/

    (DerivationTree.weakening Γ (A :: Γ) (A.imp B) h
      (List.subset_cons_of_subset A (List.Subset.refl Γ)))
    (DerivationTree.assumption (A :: Γ) A (List.Mem.head _))

/--
Prop-level deduction theorem: if `Derivable fc (A :: Γ) B` then
`Derivable fc Γ (A.imp B)`.

This is the Prop-level entry point to the deduction theorem. Because
`Derivable` is a `Prop` (a `Nonempty` wrapper around `DerivationTree`),
consumers of this corollary do **not** inherit the `noncomputable` marker
that `deductionTheorem` itself carries — use this form to avoid
`noncomputable` annotations when only derivability (not the tree) is needed.

Lives in this file (not `ProofSystem/Derivable.lean`) because the proof
depends on `deductionTheorem`, and `ProofSystem` must not import `Metalogic`.
