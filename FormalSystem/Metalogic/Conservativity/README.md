# Metalogic/Conservativity

The three conservativity questions this development answers, and the one it refuses to attempt.

| Extension | Direction | Status |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| L⁻ ⊂ L (TM⁻ into TM, via `tr`) | backward | **proved** — `derivable_translate` and the four row corollaries |
| L⁻ ⊂ L | forward | **refuted** at `.Base` and `.ZTime` — both rows machine-checked (`tmMinusCompleteBase_refuted`, `tmMinusCompleteZTime_refuted`); **open** at `.Dense` and `.RTime` |
| L ⊂ L⁺ (TM into TM⁺, via `ofFormula`) | both | **proved** at all four classes — `plusDerivable_ofFormula_iff` |

The **canonical four-row status table** for the forward row above — including what the two open
rows would still need, and the named obstruction at `.RTime` — lives in
[`TMCompletenessReduction.lean`](TMCompletenessReduction.lean)'s module docstring. Read it there
rather than reconstructing the status from the modules; it is the single place kept current.

Per-theorem status — statement, frame class, machine-pinned axiom set — is in
[`docs/theorem-index.md`](../../../docs/theorem-index.md), the single ledger. The standing
prohibition on attempting or `sorry`-ing the forward direction of L⁻ ⊂ L, with the CEB/CEF/CED/CEC
row analysis that grounds it, is in the aggregator
[`../Conservativity.lean`](../Conservativity.lean) and is not repeated here.

**Do not state a forward-conservativity theorem for L⁻ ⊂ L.** It is provably false at
`fc := .Base` and `fc := .ZTime`, so a `sorry` on it would be an unsound placeholder rather
than deferred debt.

| `DenseObstructionTransfer.lean` | 286 | Machine-checked evidence that neither closed row's separating witness transfers to the dense classes: `Sp` is a theorem of both `TM⁻_d` and `TM⁻_dc` (`spDerivableDense`, `spDerivableRTime`), and `Z1` is refuted on the flow frame over ℚ (`not_minusValidDense_z1`) |

## Key Results

- `translate` / `derivable_translate` — the backward bridge, by structural recursion over TM⁻
  derivations, parameterized by `FrameClass` so the paper's four rows are four instantiations
- `ceb_backward`, `cef_backward`, `ced_backward`, `cec_backward` — the four row corollaries
- `minus_soundness{,_dense,_ztime,_rtime}` — soundness of L⁻ against the **native** `MinusTruthAt`
  semantics, obtained by composing `translate` with the TM soundness theorems across the
  truth-transfer bridge `Semantics.truthAt_tr`
- `TMFrag` and its metatheory — the H/G-fragment of TM is the complete logic of base-language
  validity, which TM⁻ itself is not
- `tmMinusCompleteBase_iff_forwardBase` and its `.ZTime` mirror — equivalences between two unasserted
  `Prop`s, proving neither side
- `not_derivable_sp` / `tmMinusCompleteBase_refuted` — the CEB row's failing half: the schema `(Sp)`
  is not a TM⁻-theorem, refuted on the disjoint sum `ℤ ⊕ ℝ` over the native, `TaskFrame`-free
  `MinusFrame` semantics, with `minusFrameValid_of_derivation` supplying the soundness
  step the composition route could not
- `not_minus_derivable_z1` / `tmMinusCompleteZTime_refuted` — the same for the CEF row over ℤ-time
- `chainSat` / `chainBundle_truth_lemma` / `not_minusValidIn_of_not_chainSat` — the transfer half
  of the standard completeness route over the dense classes, done once and generically: a
  chain-model refutation is a task-frame refutation. The frame construction the route also needs
  was already generic in `Metalogic/Algebraic/FlowFrame.lean`, and the canonical-model half is
  **not** here
- `spDerivableDense` / `spDerivableRTime` / `not_minusValidDense_z1` — the two closed rows'
  separating witnesses provably fail to transfer to `.Dense` and `.RTime`: `Sp` is a *theorem* of
  both open systems, and `Z1` is not a validity of the dense class. Evidence about the two open
  rows, and **not** a completeness result; the four-row status is in
  `TMCompletenessReduction.lean`'s module docstring
- `plusDerivable_ofFormula_iff` — conservativity of TM⁺ over TM in both directions
