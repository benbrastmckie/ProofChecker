# Neither closed row's obstruction transfers to the dense classes

Both frame classes over which the forward direction of `L ⊂ L⁺` is **refuted** are refuted by a
*dichotomy witness*: a base-language schema that is valid over the class because the class splits
into two H/G-distinguishable halves, while no single TM-derivation covers both halves at once.

| Row | Witness | Why it separates |
|---|---|---|
| `.Base` | `Sp φ ψ := □(DF φ) ∨ □(DN ψ)` (`Conservativity/SpWitness.lean`) | every frame's single `Duration` is either dense or has a least positive element (`duration_dense_or_least_pos`), so one disjunct always holds — but which one is not decided uniformly |
| `.ZTime` | `Z1 φ := G(Gφ → φ) → (F(Gφ) → Gφ)` (`Conservativity/Backward.lean`) | valid over ℤ-time proper, refuted over the non-Archimedean discrete carrier `ℚ ×ₗ ℤ` (`Conservativity/Z1Countermodel.lean`) |

This module machine-checks that **neither witness survives the move to `FrameClass.Dense`**, for
two different and independent reasons:

* `Sp` becomes a **theorem** of the dense system. Its right disjunct's inner formula *is* the
  density axiom `Axiom.dn`, so `⊢ᴮᴸ[.Dense] □(DN ψ)` by necessitation, and `Sp` follows by
  `Axiom.prop_s` and modus ponens. A schema derivable in the system cannot witness the system's
  incompleteness. Since `Dense ≤ RTime`, the same derivation runs at `.RTime`
  (`spDerivableRTime`), so this half covers both open rows at once.
* `Z1` stops being **valid**. It is refuted here on the flow frame over ℚ, at the same valuation
  `p := {x | 1 ≤ x}` that makes `Gp ↔ p` pointwise on any dense unbounded chain. So it is not
  `BLValidDense`, and a formula that is not valid over the class cannot witness a validity the
  system fails to derive.

## What this is evidence for, and what it is not

Positively: the structural reason the two closed rows closed was that `FrameClass.Base` and
`FrameClass.ZTime` each split into two H/G-definable subclasses (dense-versus-discrete durations
in the first case, Archimedean-versus-not in the second). `FrameClass.Dense` does not split that
way, and this module is the machine-checked form of that observation — the two known separating
schemata are provably unavailable.

Negatively: **this is not a completeness proof and does not approach one.** Ruling out the two
witnesses that happen to be in the tree says nothing about the existence of some third witness.
No theorem here concludes in `TMComplete _` or `Forward _`, and the standing prohibition in
`Metalogic/Conservativity.lean` — never state a completeness or forward-conservativity theorem
and discharge it with `sorry` — applies to this module in full. The current status of all four
rows, with the residual content of the dense route and the named obstruction at the Dedekind
row, is recorded in `Conservativity/TMCompletenessReduction.lean`'s module docstring.

## The ℚ countermodel

`Conservativity/Z1Countermodel.lean`'s existing model lives at `ℚ ×ₗ ℤ`, which is **not** densely
ordered — the lexicographic second coordinate is discrete — so it cannot be reused here even
though the `Z1` refutation reads almost identically. The model below is a fresh one at
`TemporalOrder.of ℚ`, sharing only the generic `multiFamTaskFrameGen`/`multiFamHistoryGen`
scaffolding of `Metalogic/Algebraic/FlowFrame.lean`. The `FrameClass.Sat .Dense` side condition
is discharged by instance resolution straight through the reducible chain
`Sat .Dense ⇝ TaskFrame.IsDense ⇝ DenselyOrdered ℚ`.

Density is used exactly once, in `q_gp_iff_p`: to see that `Gp` fails at a point `t < 1` one needs
*some* `s` with `t < s < 1`, and `exists_between` supplies it. On `ℚ ×ₗ ℤ` the corresponding step
used the discrete successor instead, which is the precise sense in which the two countermodels
are not variants of one another.

## Main Results

- `spDerivableDense`, `spDerivableRTime` — the `.Base` witness is a theorem of both open
  systems, hence separates neither
- `q_atom_iff`, `q_gp_iff_p` — the ℚ model's valuation lemma and the pointwise `Gp ↔ p` collapse
- `q_G_Gp_imp_p`, `q_F_Gp`, `q_not_Gp`, `q_not_true_at_zero` — the three `Z1` parts and their
  combination at the base point `0`
- `not_blValidDense_z1` — the `.ZTime` witness is not dense-valid, hence separates nothing here

**`Sp` is a `TM_d` theorem.**

`Sp φ ψ` is `□(DF φ) ∨ □(DN ψ)`, and `.or` unfolds to `(·).neg.imp (·)`, so it suffices to derive
the *right* disjunct outright and weaken. The right disjunct's inner formula
`GGψ → Gψ` is literally `Axiom.dn ψ`, whose `minFrameClass` is `.Dense`; `necessitation` boxes it
and `Axiom.prop_s` supplies `χ → (θ → χ)` at `χ := □(DN ψ)`, `θ := ¬□(DF φ)`.

The tactic `by decide` does **not** discharge the `minFrameClass ≤ .Dense` side condition — the
expected type carries free variables — so the two side conditions are given as `le_refl` and
`FrameClass.base_le` terms.

Consequence: `Sp` cannot be the `.Dense` row's separating witness, because it is not a
`.Dense`-underivable validity. It is a `.Dense` *theorem*. (Contrast `Conservativity/
SpCountermodel.lean`'s `not_derivable_sp`, which is the `.Base` row, where `Axiom.dn` is not
available and the derivation below does not exist.)

Stated at the bare `DerivationTree` (`⊢ᴮᴸ[fc] φ`) rather than at `MinusLanguage.Derivable`, so the
derivation term itself is available to any consumer; see the naming-exemption note below on what
that costs.

    ⊢ᴮᴸ[FrameClass.Dense] Sp φ ψ :=
  let dn : ⊢ᴮᴸ[FrameClass.Dense] (ψ.allFuture.allFuture.imp ψ.allFuture) :=
    .axiom [] _ (Axiom.dn ψ) (le_refl FrameClass.Dense)

**`Sp` is a `TM_dc` theorem**, by the same derivation at `.RTime`.

`Axiom.dn`'s `minFrameClass` is `.Dense` and `Dense ≤ RTime` holds definitionally, so the only
change from `spDerivableDense` is the side-condition term. There is no frame-class weakening
lemma for `DerivationTree` in this tree, so the derivation is restated rather than transported;
the two proofs are deliberately kept literally parallel so that a future weakening lemma can
replace both at once.

Together with `spDerivableDense` this closes the `Sp` half for **both** open rows.

    ⊢ᴮᴸ[FrameClass.RTime] Sp φ ψ :=
  let dn : ⊢ᴮᴸ[FrameClass.RTime] (ψ.allFuture.allFuture.imp ψ.allFuture) :=
    .axiom [] _ (Axiom.dn ψ) (show FrameClass.Dense ≤ FrameClass.RTime from trivial)

    .axiom [] _ (Axiom.prop_s _ _) (FrameClass.base_le _)
  DerivationTree.modus_ponens [] _ _ s boxdn

/-! ### Why these two are `def`s, and why they are not restated

`spDerivableDense` and `spDerivableRTime` are `DerivationTree`-valued, hence `def`s rather than
`theorem`s. They now carry lowerCamelCase names, which is what the rule table in
`docs/development/NAMING_CONVENTION_DEVIATION.md` requires of anything a declaration *produces*
as data — `DerivationTree`-valued results included — so no linter exemption is needed and none is
given.

They read as derivability facts rather than as constructions, and every neighbouring result in
this namespace that says something about what TM does or does not derive is snake_case —
`z1_translate`, `not_derivable_sp`, `not_bl_derivable_z1`, `blValid_sp`. Those are snake_case
because they are `Prop`-valued proofs; these two say the same kind of thing but are `def`s only
because `⊢ᴮᴸ[fc] φ` is `DerivationTree` rather than `Nonempty ∘ DerivationTree`. That is a fact
about the notation, not about what the declarations assert, and the naming rule keys on the
former.

The `Nonempty`-wrapped restatement at `MinusLanguage.Derivable` is deliberately **not** provided:
it would be a second name for the same fact under a strictly weaker statement, and a plain
`⟨spDerivableDense φ ψ⟩` at any use site is shorter than the wrapper would be. That prohibition is
still in force — the rename resolved the naming question without touching either signature. -/

/-- The countermodel's valuation: `p` holds at `w` iff `w`'s ℚ-coordinate is `≥ 1`. The same

the ℚ-component of a lexicographic pair. -/

**`Gp ↔ p`, pointwise** — the collapse that makes `Z1` fail.

`←` is monotonicity of the half-line: if `1 ≤ t` and `t < s` then `1 ≤ s`. `→` is where
**density** enters, and is the step that has no analogue in `Z1Countermodel.lean`: if `t < 1`,
`exists_between` produces `s` with `t < s < 1`, and `p` fails at `s`, so `Gp` fails at `t`. On the
discrete carrier `ℚ ×ₗ ℤ` the corresponding witness was the lexicographic successor
`(t.1, t.2 + 1)` instead, which is why the two models are not variants of one another.

**The `.ZTime` witness is not dense-valid.**

`BLValidDense` is `BLValidIn .Dense`, so one `.Dense`-satisfying frame carrying a refutation
suffices; `BLValidIn.apply_total` supplies the elimination and the `FrameClass.Sat .Dense qF` side
condition is `inferInstance` through the reducible chain to `DenselyOrdered ℚ`.

With `spDerivableDense`, this is the machine-checked half of the record that the `.Dense` row
has no known separating witness: one of the two candidates is a theorem of the system, the other
is not a validity of the class.
