# The register extension L⋆ / TM⋆ — soundness and conservativity

**TM⋆** is the logic of the language L⋆ = L⁺ + the time registers `↑ⁱ`/`↓ⁱ`
(`FormalSystem/StarLanguage/`): one `ofBase` constructor carrying every TM⁺ schema at its
`ofPlus` instances, plus sixteen register schemata, under the seven rules of TM⁺ and TM. Its
semantics is `def:BLstar-semantics` over points `(τ, x, v⃗)`
(`FormalSystem/Semantics/StarTruth.lean`).

**This file is the aggregator, and it holds no declarations.**

| Module | Contents |
|--------|----------|
| `Conservativity/Star/StarAxiomValidity.lean` | `starAxiom_validIn_min`, `starAxiom_swap_validIn_min` — validity and swap-validity of every `StarAxiom` constructor, one arm each and no wildcard |
| `Conservativity/Star/StarSoundness.lean` | `star_derivable_valid_and_swap_validIn`, `star_soundness_validIn`, the four rows, `star_not_derivable_nil_bot` — soundness of TM⋆ at every class, TD discharged semantically |
| `Conservativity/Star/Forward.lean` | `forward_star`, `starDerivable_ofFormula_iff` — TM⋆ conservative over TM in both directions, unconditionally; `starConservative_of_plusComplete` and `plusIncomplete_of_starNonconservative` — the conditional pair over TM⁺ |

## The result, stated precisely

**TM⋆ over TM: unconditional, both directions, all four classes.** For every L formula `φ`,
`TM⋆ ⊢⋆[fc] ofPlus (ofFormula φ) ↔ TM ⊢[fc] φ` (`starDerivable_ofFormula_iff`). Adding the time
registers proves no new theorem of the base language.

**TM⋆ over TM⁺: a proved conditional pair, because TM⁺ completeness is open.** If TM⁺ is complete
at `fc` then TM⋆ is conservative over it (`starConservative_of_plusComplete`); and,
unconditionally, any separating witness for non-conservativity is a witness of TM⁺ incompleteness
(`plusIncomplete_of_starNonconservative`). The question is therefore *equivalent modulo TM⋆
soundness* to the tree's own recorded open problem, and no work on TM⋆ alone can decide it.

**TM⋆ completeness: OPEN, under two named obstructions.** See
`Conservativity/Star/README.md`.
