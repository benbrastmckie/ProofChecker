# Soundness for the base language BL, by composition

`TM ⊢ φ  ⟹  BL-validity of φ`, at `FrameClass.Base` and at each of the three extensions, obtained
by composing two things this repository already has:

```
⊢⁻[fc] φ  ──[Conservativity.translate]──▸  ⊢[fc] tr φ  ──[soundness…]──▸  M,τ,x ⊨ tr φ
                                                                              ‖ truthAt_tr
                                                                          M,τ,x ⊨ᴮᴸ φ
```

The right-hand equality is the **truth-transfer bridge** `truthAt_tr`, proved here by induction on
`MinusFormula`. It is a theorem, not a definition: `MinusTruthAt` is defined natively on `MinusFormula`
(`Semantics/MinusTruth.lean`), so the bridge has to be earned. Four of its six cases are `Iff.rfl` or
congruence; the `allPast` and `allFuture` cases are the two with content, and both are discharged
by the existing `@[simp]` characterizations `Truth.past_iff` and `Truth.future_iff`, which unfold
BL⁺'s `untl`/`snce`-derived `H`/`G` abbreviations to exactly the quantifications `MinusTruthAt`
states directly.

## What composition certifies, and what it does not

These theorems inherit per-axiom validity from `Metalogic/Soundness.lean`'s BL⁺ validity lemmas
together with `MinusLanguage/AxiomDischarge.lean`'s discharge table. That is mathematically
complete — every BL axiom's translation is a BL⁺ theorem, and every BL⁺ theorem is valid — but it
does mean **no BL axiom is ever evaluated directly against `MinusTruthAt` by the composition
itself**. The three native `example`s at the end of this module are the standing evidence that
`MinusTruthAt` carries real content independently of the composition: each proves a BL axiom scheme
valid by unfolding `MinusTruthAt`'s clauses and nothing else.

`Conservativity.translate` is `noncomputable`, but it occurs only inside proof terms of
`Prop`-valued theorems, so it contributes nothing to the axiom profile; every result below sits at
`[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

## The Dedekind target

`minus_soundness_rtime` concludes at `MinusValidRTime`, **not** at a density-free
`MinusValidComplete` — which is deliberately not defined. `Semantics/MinusValidity.lean`'s module
docstring gives the BL-native refutation: `Axiom.dn` is admissible at `FrameClass.RTime` and is
false on `ℤ`, which satisfies every remaining binder. This mirrors `soundness_rtime`'s own
target on the BL⁺ side.

## Why there is no dense or Dedekind consistency corollary

Consistency is a per-frame-class fact read off a soundness theorem together with a *witness
frame* for that class. The tree carries `trivialFrame` over `Int`, which serves `FrameClass.Base`
and `FrameClass.ZTime`; it carries no dense or Dedekind-complete witness frame. The BL⁺ side
records the same asymmetry in `Metalogic/Soundness.lean`'s docstring for `not_derivable_nil_bot`
("there is no `{fc}`-uniform statement, because `Dense` and `Dedekind` have no corresponding
consistency lemma in the tree yet"), and the BL side inherits it exactly.

## Main Results

- `truthAt_tr` — the bridge: `TruthAt M τ t (tr φ) ↔ MinusTruthAt M τ t φ`
- `truthAt_trCtx`, `minusValid_iff_valid_tr` — its context-level and validity-level corollaries
- `minusTruthAt_timeShift` — time-homogeneity of `MinusTruthAt`, the BL mirror of
  `Semantics.TimeShift.timeShift_preserves_truth`
- `minus_box_universal` — `□` is the **universal** modality over the whole model: history-blind by
  definition, time-blind by `Truth.box_const`
- `minusValidZTime_iff_validZTime_tr` — the `.ZTime` mirror of `minusValid_iff_valid_tr`,
  consumed by `Metalogic/Conservativity/TMCompletenessReduction.lean`
- `minus_soundness`, `minus_soundness_dense`, `minus_soundness_ztime`, `minus_soundness_rtime` — the
  four soundness theorems
- `minus_soundness_valid`, `minus_soundness_dense_valid`, `minus_soundness_ztime_valid`,
  `minus_soundness_rtime_valid` — their empty-context validity forms
- `minus_soundness_ztime_succ`, `minus_soundness_ztime_succ_valid` — a **fifth** soundness
  theorem, at `FrameClass.ZTime` with the two Archimedean binders dropped. Unlike the four
  above, it is **not** a composition (`Soundness.soundness_ztime` itself carries the binders
  being dropped); it is proved directly against `MinusTruthAt`. See its own docstring section below.
- `minus_not_derivable_nil_bot`, `minus_not_derivable_nil_bot_ztime` — consistency of BL at
  `FrameClass.Base` and `FrameClass.ZTime`

**The truth-transfer bridge.** A BL⁺ formula in the image of the translation is true exactly when
the base-language formula it translates is true, at the same model, history and time.

Proved by induction on `φ`, `generalizing τ t` — which is mandatory rather than stylistic: the
`box` case needs the induction hypothesis at a *different history* `σ`, and the two temporal cases
need it at a *different time* `s`. With `generalizing` the hypothesis reads `∀ τ t, …`, so each
use site applies it explicitly.

Case by case: `atom` and `bot` are `Iff.rfl`, because the two clauses are literally the same
expression (including the domain conjunct — see `Semantics/MinusTruth.lean` on Decision A); `imp` and
`box` are congruence under `tr`'s `rfl` push-through equations; `allPast` and `allFuture` are the
only two cases with content, and `Truth.past_iff` / `Truth.future_iff` supply it.

of its translation is true. This is the side-condition discharger each of the four soundness

/-! ### Two structural corollaries of the bridge

Both are BL mirrors of facts `Semantics/Truth.lean` already carries for BL⁺, and both are obtained
by pushing the statement through `truthAt_tr` in each direction rather than by a fresh induction
on `MinusFormula`. They are grouped here, immediately after the bridge, because that is the only
reason they are cheap: `Semantics/MinusTruth.lean` cannot state either of them, since it sits below
the translation in the import order.
-/

/--
**Time-homogeneity of `MinusTruthAt`** — the BL mirror of
`Semantics.TimeShift.timeShift_preserves_truth`.

Shifting a history by `y - x` moves the truth value at time `y` to time `x`, for every BL formula
and at an *arbitrary* history: no totality, convexity-beyond-the-structure, or shift-closure
hypothesis is needed, exactly as on the BL⁺ side, because `ShiftRel` is pointwise.

**Proof**: rewrite both sides through `truthAt_tr` and apply the BL⁺ statement at `tr φ`. No
induction — the induction was already paid for once, in `truthAt_tr`.
-/
theorem minusTruthAt_timeShift (M : TaskModel F) (σ : ConvexHistory F)
    (x y : F.Duration) (φ : MinusFormula) :
    MinusTruthAt M (ConvexHistory.timeShift σ (y - x)) x φ ↔ MinusTruthAt M σ y φ := by
  rw [← truthAt_tr M φ (ConvexHistory.timeShift σ (y - x)) x, ← truthAt_tr M φ σ y]
  exact TimeShift.timeShift_preserves_truth M σ x y (tr φ)

/--
**`□` is the universal modality over the whole model.**

`MinusTruthAt`'s box clause quantifies over all total histories at the *current* time, so
history-independence is definitional. Time-independence is the substantive half and is
`Truth.box_const`, itself time-homogeneity (`minusTruthAt_timeShift` is the same fact stated at the
BL level). Composing the two: `□φ` holds at one total history-and-time exactly when `φ` holds at
*every* total history and *every* time.

**Consequence, and the reason this lemma is stated rather than left implicit.** BL over task
frames is not a product logic in the hard sense: the `□`/`H`,`G` interaction contributes no
"same-time alignment" validities, because `□` ranges over the whole model rather than over a
time-indexed fibre. The Kripke structure a BL formula can see is therefore an indexed family of
`F.Duration`-chains with a *universal* box, which is what makes a valuation-only truth lemma over
the translation frames of `Metalogic/Algebraic/FlowFrame.lean` possible at all — see
`Metalogic/Conservativity/ChainBundleTruth.lean`.

`hτ` is stated because every consumer has it to hand and because `Truth.box_const` binds it; like
`box_const`'s own two totality binders it is **not consumed**, the statement holding for an
arbitrary `τ`.

/-! ### The two transfer theorems

One per BL validity layer, and the whole of the BL/BL⁺ validity bridge. Everything else in this
section is a corollary of one of them at a fixed predicate or tag.
-/

/--
**Transfer at a bare frame predicate.** BL validity over the frames satisfying `P` is BL⁺ validity
of the translation over the same frames.

**Why this one is required and is not redundant given the tag-indexed form below.**
`MinusValidOnFrames` — and its monotonicity lemma `MinusValidOnFrames.mono` — quantifies over an
arbitrary `P : TaskFrame → Prop`, and for arbitrary `P` there is no `fc` with `P = fc.Sat`: only
four predicates out of all of `TaskFrame → Prop` are named by a tag. This is the same asymmetry
that puts `ValidComplete` (`ValidOnFrames TaskFrame.IsComplete`) outside the `ValidIn` family, and
it is why `Semantics/Validity.lean` carries a `ValidOnFrames.mono` / `ValidIn.mono` split rather
than one lemma. The tag-indexed theorem below is this one at `fc.Sat`; the reverse derivation does
not exist.

A **corollary of `truthAt_tr`, not a definitional identity** — see `minusValid_iff_valid_tr` below on
why that distinction is load-bearing.

**Transfer at a `FrameClass` tag.** `minusValidOnFrames_iff_validOnFrames_tr` at `fc.Sat`, which is
what `MinusValidIn` and `ValidIn` are both defined as. Every named BL/BL⁺ validity equivalence in

/--
The validity-level bridge, at the unconstrained class: `minusValidIn_iff_validIn_tr` at
`.Base`, where `MinusValid` and `Valid` respectively are.

This is a **corollary of `truthAt_tr`, not the definition of `MinusValid`**. `MinusValid` is defined
against the native `MinusTruthAt`; stating this equivalence as a theorem is what keeps the
distinction visible, since defining BL truth as `TruthAt ∘ tr` would make it hold by `Iff.rfl` and
would make every BL soundness theorem below a restatement of its BL⁺ source rather than a claim
about BL.

the single packed `Sat .ZTime F` hypothesis, so neither direction has to open it. Like
`minusValid_iff_valid_tr`, a one-line corollary of `minusValidIn_iff_validIn_tr`.

/-! ## Soundness of BL, parameterized by `FrameClass`

`minus_soundness_in` is the whole of it: translate the BL derivation, apply
`Metalogic/Soundness.lean`'s `soundness_in` at the same class, and cross the truth-transfer
bridge back into BL's native semantics. Nothing in that composition mentions a particular class —
`Conservativity.translate` is already `fc`-polymorphic, and neither `truthAt_tr` nor
`truthAt_trCtx` carries a frame condition — so the four named theorems below are instances of it,
each supplying its class's `FrameClass.Sat` witness and keeping its original statement exactly. -/

/--
**Soundness of BL at an arbitrary `FrameClass`.** A BL derivation of `φ` from `Γ` at `fc` makes
`φ` true at every model, **total** history and time over any frame satisfying `fc`, at which every

/-! ## `minus_soundness_ztime_succ` — binder-weakened discrete BL soundness

The single missing prerequisite for CEF (report §6.1): BL soundness at `FrameClass.ZTime`
under `[SuccOrder] [PredOrder]` only, dropping `[IsSuccArchimedean] [IsPredArchimedean]`, so that
it applies to the non-Archimedean carrier `ℚ ×ₗ ℤ` (`Semantics/LexCarrier.lean`) the CEF
countermodel is built over.

**This is not a composition.** Unlike `minus_soundness`/`minus_soundness_dense`/`minus_soundness_ztime`/
`minus_soundness_rtime` above, `minus_soundness_ztime_succ` cannot be obtained by translating and
invoking `Soundness.soundness_ztime`, because that theorem's own binder bundle carries the very
two Archimedean instances being dropped here. It is proved instead by induction on
`MinusLanguage.DerivationTree FrameClass.ZTime`, directly against `MinusTruthAt`.

The only genuinely new semantic content is `Semantics.MinusSchemaValidity`'s DF lemma
(`df_valid_of_succOrder`) and its `PredOrder` past-dual (`swapMinus_df_valid_of_predOrder`), needed
respectively for the `df` axiom leaf and for the `temporal_duality` case's swap component.
Every other axiom — the twelve with `minFrameClass = .Base` — is discharged **without any
semantic argument at all**: `minus_derivable_valid_and_swap_valid_zTimeSucc` re-derives each one
(and its swap) proof-theoretically, by composing `minus_soundness_valid` with the `TD` rule itself
(`⊢[Base] φ ⟹ ⊢[Base] φ.swapMinus`), never touching `MinusTruthAt` directly for those twelve. `dn`/`co`
are eliminated structurally: `FrameClass.Dense` and `FrameClass.RTime` are each incomparable
with `FrameClass.ZTime`, so their axiom leaves are unreachable under the `h_fc` side
condition. -/

/--
Combined validity and swap-validity, on `[SuccOrder] [PredOrder]` frames (no Archimedean
binders), for BL theorems (empty-context derivations) at `FrameClass.ZTime`. The companion
`minus_soundness_ztime_succ`'s `temporal_duality` case needs exactly the swap half of this, as an
external fact — mirroring `Metalogic/Soundness.lean`'s `derivable_valid_and_swap_validIn` (the
BL⁺ sibling this parallels), but over BL's own 15-constructor `Axiom` rather than BL⁺'s 45, and
without the `FrameClass` parameter, since the binder-weakened `.ZTime` frames this is stated
over are not a `FrameClass.Sat` variant.

The `axiom` case's `by_cases hbase : h_ax.minFrameClass ≤ FrameClass.Base` split is the same
device `Metalogic/Soundness.lean`'s `axiom_swap_validIn_min` uses: it separates the twelve
instance-free (`.Base`-classed)
axioms — whose validity **and swap-validity** both come for free via `minus_soundness_valid`
composed with the `TD` proof rule — from the three that are not, without enumerating the twelve
constructors by name.

**Soundness of BL at `FrameClass.ZTime`, binder-weakened.** A BL derivation of `φ` from `Γ`
makes `φ` true at every model, **total** history and time at which every formula of `Γ` is true —
on any `TaskFrame` carrying `[SuccOrder] [PredOrder]`, with **no** `IsSuccArchimedean` /
`IsPredArchimedean` requirement.

By induction on `d`, directly against `MinusTruthAt` (see the module docstring above for why this
cannot be a composition). The `axiom` case's `by_cases` split and the `temporal_duality` case's
call into `minus_derivable_valid_and_swap_valid_zTimeSucc` mirror that lemma's own proof exactly.

/-! ## Consistency

Two corollaries only, at `FrameClass.Base` and `FrameClass.ZTime`; the module docstring
explains why the dense and Dedekind cases are deliberately absent. Both are phrased as
`¬ MinusLanguage.Derivable …` rather than through `Metalogic.Core.Consistent`, for the same
import-graph reason `not_derivable_nil_bot` records on the BL⁺ side. -/

/--
**BL at `FrameClass.Base` is consistent**: `⊥` is not derivable from the empty context.

The witness is `trivialFrame` over `Int`, exactly as in `not_derivable_nil_bot`. The step across
the bridge is invisible here because `tr MinusFormula.bot` is `Formula.bot` definitionally, so
`TaskFrame.not_validOn_bot` applies unchanged.

Paper: — (formalization-native; the paper defines BL (`def:BL-semantics`) but states no BL consistency corollary)

**BL at `FrameClass.ZTime` is consistent**: `⊥` is not derivable from the empty context in the

The witness is again `trivialFrame` over `ℤ`, with the single total history supplied by
`TaskFrame.hF_nonempty_of_frameAxioms` and the valuation by `TaskModel.allFalse`.

/-! ## Native spot checks

Three BL axiom schemes proved valid *directly* against `MinusTruthAt`, using nothing but its clauses.
They are not consumed by anything above — their job is to stand as evidence that the BL semantics
carries content on its own, independently of the composition, and they are the guard against
`MinusTruthAt` ever being redefined as `TruthAt ∘ tr` (under which these scripts would not go through
as written).

**Do not delete these as redundant now that `minusValidOnFrames_iff_validOnFrames_tr` and
`minusValidIn_iff_validIn_tr` exist.** Those two are corollaries of the *theorem* `truthAt_tr`, not
of a definitional identity, so they presuppose exactly what these examples independently witness:
that `MinusTruthAt` is a separate definition which happens to agree with `TruthAt ∘ tr`. If BL truth
were ever redefined as the composite, the transfer theorems would become `Iff.rfl` and would stop
carrying any information — and these three examples are what would fail first and say so.

`MT` is the informative one: it closes because `τ` is *itself* total, which is precisely the `H_F`
reading of `def:BL-semantics`'s box clause. -/
