# The two-fibre countermodel and CEB's failing half

Machine-checks the claim `Metalogic/Conservativity/SpWitness.lean` explicitly disclaims: the
boxed dichotomy

  `(Sp) := □(DF φ) ∨ □(DN ψ)`

is **not** a theorem of TM⁻, the tense-primitive base proof system
`MinusLanguage.DerivationTree FrameClass.Base`. Together with `SpWitness.minusValid_sp` (`(Sp)` is
L⁻-valid on every task frame) this refutes TM⁻'s weak completeness over the task-frame class:
`tmMinusCompleteBase_refuted : ¬ TMMinusCompleteBase`, the `.Base` mirror of
`Z1Countermodel.tmMinusCompleteZTime_refuted`.

## Why no task-frame refutation can exist

`(Sp)` is valid on *every* task frame, so the refuting structure must lie outside the class. The
route taken here is a native semantics: `Semantics/MinusFrame.lean` supplies a frame notion with no
group structure on time, native L⁻ soundness for TM⁻ is proved directly against it
(`minusFrameValid_of_derivation`), and the countermodel is an instance of that class. Note the
contrast with the `TaskFrame`-bound stack: **TM is unsound** on the two-fibre structure below,
so no composition through `tr` and L soundness is available. The soundness theorem in this
module is about TM⁻ (`MinusLanguage.DerivationTree`), never about TM, and the two must not be
blurred.

## Why the countermodel needs *two* order shapes

Sharpened order-theoretic impossibility argument. Fix a strict linear order and a time `t`.

* The `DF` instance `(Hφ ∧ φ ∧ F⊤) → F(Hφ)` can fail at `t` only if `t` has **no immediate
  successor**: if `t < s` were least above `t`, then `Hφ` at `t` together with `φ` at `t` gives
  `Hφ` at `s`, so `F(Hφ)` holds.
* The `DN` instance `GGφ → Gφ` can fail at `t` only if `t` **has** an immediate successor: a
  failure needs a point `s > t` where `φ` fails while `φ` holds throughout the future of every
  future of `t`, which forces `s` to have no point of the future of `t` strictly below it.

The two failure conditions are mutually exclusive at a fixed time, regardless of the valuation,
the number of histories, or any group structure. So on a *single* linear order no time refutes
both disjuncts, and — since `□` is the universal modality — no point refutes `(Sp)`. A
countermodel therefore needs two differently-shaped orders simultaneously `□`-accessible. That is
exactly a **disjoint** sum of orders, `ℤ ⊕ ℝ` here, and *not* the lexicographic sum `ℤ + ℚ`: a
lexicographic sum is again a single linear order and is refuted by the argument above.

## The claim is schema-level, not universally quantified

"No instance of `(Sp)` is a theorem of TM⁻" is **false as literally stated**, and must not be
re-attempted. `DF ⊤` is true at every point of every `MinusFrame` (its consequent `F(H⊤)` follows
from `no_max`), so `□(DF ⊤)` holds everywhere and `Sp ⊤ ψ` is not refuted here — indeed it is
TM⁻-derivable. The deliverable is the schema-level claim, witnessed by the atomic instance
`Sp (.atom a) (.atom a)`. Refuting `TMMinusCompleteBase` needs exactly one L⁻-valid non-theorem, so
nothing is lost.

## Main Definitions

- `twoFibre` — the countermodel frame `ℤ ⊕ ℝ` (Mathlib's disjoint-sum order)
- `twoV` — its valuation

## Main Results

- `minusFrameValid_of_axiom` — every TM⁻ axiom schema admissible at `FrameClass.Base` is `MinusFrameValid`
- `minusFrameValid_of_derivation` — **native L⁻ soundness**: every TM⁻ theorem is `MinusFrameValid`
- `df_fails`, `dn_fails` — the two disjuncts fail, on the `ℝ` and `ℤ` fibres respectively
- `sp_false` — `(Sp)` is false at every point of `twoFibre`
- `not_derivable_sp` — **CEB's failing half**: `(Sp)` is not a TM⁻-theorem
- `tmMinusCompleteBase_refuted` — `¬ TMMinusCompleteBase`

/-! ## Native L⁻ soundness for TM⁻

Naming note: the axiom-validity lemma is `minusFrameValid_of_axiom`, not the bare `axiom_valid` a
reader might expect by analogy with `Metalogic/Soundness.lean`. That base name is already taken
there by the L lemma (about `Formula`, not `MinusFormula`), and the repository's C23 invariant
additionally forbids resolving the clash by nesting a namespace — a shadowed base name defeats
the dead-declaration census. The `minusFrameValid_of_*` pair also reads better together.
-/

/--
**Every TM⁻ axiom admissible at `FrameClass.Base` is valid on the native L⁻ frame class.**

Sixteen `MinusLanguage.Axiom` constructors, thirteen of which have `minFrameClass = .Base`:

* propositional — `prop_k`, `prop_s`, `ex_falso`, `peirce` (`peirce` is the one classical step);
* modal — `modal_k`, `modal_t`, `modal_5`, `modal_future`, all immediate because `□` is the
  universal modality over `F.Point`;
* temporal — `temp_k`, `temp_4` (from `lt_trans`), `temp_serial` (from `no_max`), `temp_connect`,
  `temp_linearity` (from `fut_lin`, the longest branch).

The remaining three (`df`, `dn`, `co`) carry `minFrameClass` `.ZTime`, `.Dense`, `.RTime`, none of
which is `≤ .Base`, so the side condition `h_fc` is absurd for them. Exhaustiveness of `cases ax`
is what confirms the census — a missed constructor is a compile error, not an oversight.

**Native L⁻ soundness for TM⁻.** Every closed `FrameClass.Base` derivation yields a formula valid
on the whole native L⁻ frame class.

Recursion over all seven `MinusLanguage.DerivationTree` constructors. `assumption` is vacuous at
the empty context; `modus_ponens`, `necessitation` and `temporal_necessitation` are immediate
from the corresponding truth clauses (the last two because `MinusFrameValid` already quantifies over
every point). `temporal_duality` is one line via `Semantics.truth_swap` at `F.swap`, which is
available precisely because the frame class is converse-closed. `weakening` routes through
`DerivationTree.ofWeakeningNil`, with `height_ofWeakeningNil_lt` supplying termination.

**The two-fibre frame.** `ℤ ⊕ ℝ` under Mathlib's disjoint-sum order: two incomparable copies of
time, one discrete and one dense-and-complete, both `□`-accessible because `□` is the universal
modality.

The **disjoint** sum is what the impossibility argument in the module docstring demands; a
*lexicographic* sum such as `ℤ + ℚ` is again a single linear order and cannot work. `ℝ` rather
than `ℚ` only because `linarith` is frictionless there — any dense order without endpoints would
do.

`@[reducible]` is load-bearing, not decoration: without it the valuation's type
`ℤ ⊕ ℝ → Atom → Prop` and the expected `twoFibre.Point → Atom → Prop` sit at different
transparency levels, and `rw [MinusFrameTruth.and_iff]` fails on the mismatch.

**`DF` fails on the `ℝ` fibre.** At `inr 0` the antecedent `Hp ∧ p ∧ F⊤` holds — `p` is true
exactly on the non-positive reals, which is downward closed, and `inr 1` witnesses `F⊤` — while
the consequent `F(Hp)` fails: any later real `r > 0` has `r / 2` strictly between `0` and `r`
with `p` false there, so `Hp` fails at every witness.

This is the disjunct that needs a time with no immediate successor.

`□` is the universal modality, so each disjunct of `Sp` is refuted by exhibiting one point where

**CEB's failing half: `(Sp)` is not a theorem of TM⁻.**

The atomic instance `Sp p p` is `MinusFrameValid`-refuted by `twoFibre`, and native L⁻ soundness
(`minusFrameValid_of_derivation`) says every TM⁻ theorem is `MinusFrameValid`. This is
the claim `SpWitness.lean` disclaims as out of scope; it is now discharged.

The statement is deliberately **schema-level**, witnessed by an atomic instance. The universally
quantified reading — "no instance of `(Sp)` is a TM⁻-theorem" — is *false*: `□(DF ⊤)` holds on
every `MinusFrame` (its consequent follows from `no_max`), so `Sp ⊤ ψ` is not refuted here. See the
module docstring.

open, and no theorem here concludes `TMMinusCompleteBase`, `ForwardBase` or `forward` positively.
