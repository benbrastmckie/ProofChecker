# The `(Sp)` witness — validity, and the TM⁺ half of CEB

`(Sp) := □(DF φ) ∨ □(DN ψ)` — the *reconstruction* (not the source's formula; see the
Provenance section below) of the CEB witness `Conservativity.lean`'s module docstring names.
This module proves `BLValid (Sp φ ψ)` from `duration_dense_or_least_pos`'s dichotomy composed
with `Semantics/BLSchemaValidity.lean`'s Lemmas B and C, then derives
`⊢[Base] tr (Sp φ ψ)` from `BXCanonical.completeness` — the CEB analogue of `Conservativity.lean`'s
`z1_translate`, obtained without the source's TMP-NB/M5 derivation (report §4.1, §6.2 closing
paragraph).

## What this does **not** do

CEB's failing half — the schema `(Sp)` is not a TM-theorem — is out of scope *here* and is not
claimed or approached by anything in this module: `BLTruthAt`/`bl_soundness` are
`TaskFrame`-bound and TM⁺ is *unsound* on the two-fibre class, so the composition route this
module uses is unavailable for that half (report §6.2).

It is, however, no longer an open claim. It is discharged in
`FormalSystem/Metalogic/Conservativity/SpCountermodel.lean`, which builds the native
(`TaskFrame`-free) semantics of `FormalSystem/Semantics/BLFrame.lean`, proves BL soundness for TM
directly against it, and refutes the atomic instance on the disjoint sum `ℤ ⊕ ℝ` —
`not_derivable_sp`, and its corollary `tmCompleteBase_refuted : ¬ TMCompleteBase`. Note the claim
there is **schema-level**: `□(DF ⊤)` holds on every `BLFrame`, so `Sp ⊤ ψ` is *not* refuted, and
the universally quantified reading is false.

## The un-boxed sharpening (report §4.2)

The *un-boxed* `DF φ ∨ DN ψ` is valid on every strict linear order whatsoever — `□` is what
turns the dichotomy from a property of one history's local order into a frame-uniform one (a
single shared `Duration` on which the whole frame's dichotomy is decided once). `blValid_df_or_dn`
below proves this un-boxed claim directly, since it costs nothing beyond dropping the `.box`/
`box_iff` step from `blValid_sp`'s own proof.

## Provenance

`(Sp)` is a *reconstruction*, not the source's formula: `thm:ConservativeExtension` was deleted
from the paper at `b07ceb31`; see `Conservativity.lean`'s "Provenance of the source claim"
section, which is the authority on that history.

## Main Definitions

- `Sp` — `□(DF φ) ∨ □(DN ψ)`, the boxed dichotomy witness

## Main Results

- `blValid_df_or_dn` — the un-boxed sharpening: `DF φ ∨ DN ψ` is valid on every task frame
- `blValid_sp` — `BLValid (Sp φ ψ)`
- `sp_translate` — `⊢[Base] tr (Sp φ ψ)`, the CEB witness's TM⁺ half

**The un-boxed sharpening (report §4.2).** `DF φ ∨ DN ψ` — without the `□` — is true at every
model, history and time, on *every* task frame whatsoever: `Sp`'s dichotomy is decided once by
the frame's own `Duration` (via `duration_dense_or_least_pos`), before any modal quantification.
What `□` in `Sp` detects is therefore modal rigidity, not a temporal property — a structure
refuting `(Sp)` must be one where *different histories* see differently-shaped time (the
two-fibre countermodel report §6.2 names as CEB's missing piece, out of scope here).

**`BLValid (Sp φ ψ)`.** Case-split on `duration_dense_or_least_pos F.Duration`: the
least-positive branch gives the left disjunct at every history via `df_valid_of_isLeast_pos`,
the dense branch gives the right via `dn_valid_of_denselyOrdered`.

The `□` is discharged by the frame carrying **one shared** `Duration`, which is what makes the
dichotomy a property of the frame rather than of a history: `duration_dense_or_least_pos` is
applied once, to `F.Duration`, before the `∀ σ, σ.IsTotal → …` quantification of `box_iff`.
