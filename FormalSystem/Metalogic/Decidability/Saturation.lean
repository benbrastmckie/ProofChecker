# Tableau Saturation and Expansion

This module implements the saturation process for tableau branches and
the main tableau expansion algorithm with termination guarantees.

## Main Definitions

- `ExpandedTableau`: Result type for fully expanded tableaux
- `expandToCompletion`: Expand a branch until closed or saturated
- `buildTableau`: Build complete tableau for a formula

## Termination

Termination is guaranteed by the subformula property: tableau expansion
only produces formulas from the subformula closure of the initial branch.
The total complexity decreases with each expansion step.

## Expanded Tableau Type
-/

/--
A fully expanded tableau has all branches either closed or saturated.

- `allClosed`: All branches closed → formula is valid
- `hasOpen`: At least one saturated open branch → formula is invalid
-/
inductive ExpandedTableau : Type where
  /-- All branches are closed (formula is valid). -/
  | allClosed (closedBranches : List ClosedBranch)
  /-- At least one branch is open/saturated (formula is invalid).

      Carries the `TimeOrdering` for countermodel extraction, the `FrameClass` the tableau was
      built for, and applied-set-**free** saturation: `findUnexpanded … = none`.

      **The applied set is deliberately not carried** (R5, see the section below). It was here
      only because saturation had to be stated applied-set-aware, and that in turn was forced by
      the destructive `.linear`/`.branching` arms of `expandOnce`. With those arms guarded and
      non-destructive, nothing is orphaned, the applied set is inert, and the certificate states
      the predicate a truth lemma can actually consume, with no auxiliary invariant.

      **The `fc` field repairs a latent defect.** The saturation check's `fc` argument defaults
      to `.Base`; it was supplied at neither this constructor nor either `buildTableau` site, so
      the certificate previously certified `.Base` saturation for all four frame classes.

      **What `findUnexpanded = none` does and does not mean.** It reads `findApplicableRule`,
      which reads `allRulesForFC`, and `serialityRule` is deliberately outside `allRulesForFC`
      (it is scheduled by the two-stage pick, not gated by frame class). So this field says "no
      *ordinary* rule applies", and a certified branch may still be owed `T(F ⊤)`/`T(P ⊤)` at
      every label. Those are true at every point of any serial frame, so the extracted model is
      unaffected — but the truth lemma must *state* the gap rather than assume it away, and the
      certificate is deliberately not weakened to a disjunction to hide it. -/

## Certificate Strength (R5)

**Status: closed, and the certificate has been changed accordingly.** `ExpandedTableau.hasOpen`
no longer carries the applied set at all; it carries the `FrameClass` and applied-set-free
saturation, `findUnexpanded openBranch (timeOrd := timeOrdering) (fc := fc) = none`. The
predicates below are retained as history only, and nothing depends on them.

Three things were decided by measurement rather than argument, and each is recorded in place:

1. **The certificate is a single conjunct, not a disjunction.** It was predicted that once
   `serialityRule` landed no open branch would ever be fully saturated in the
   `findUnexpanded = none` sense — seriality always demands one more successor — so the field
   would have to weaken to `findUnexpanded … = none ∨ (findBlockedTime …).isSome`. Measured
   false: `serialityRule` is deliberately outside `allRulesForFC`, `findUnexpanded` reads
   `allRulesForFC`, and the corpus's `CertificateProbe` certifies both `◇p` and the
   genuinely-open `G p → p` with seriality on. The disjunction was deleted before it was
   written.
2. **What the field therefore means, exactly.** "No *ordinary* rule applies." A certified branch
   may still be owed `T(F ⊤)`/`T(P ⊤)` at every label. Those hold at every point of any serial
   frame, so the extracted model is unaffected — but the truth lemma must state that gap rather
   than assume it away. Weakening the certificate to hide it was the alternative, and was
   rejected.
3. **The `fc` field repairs a latent defect.** The saturation check's `fc` argument defaults to
   `.Base` and was supplied at neither the constructor nor either `buildTableau` site, so the
   certificate certified `.Base` saturation for all four frame classes. Both sites now pass the
   tableau's own class. No corpus verdict moved when they started doing so.

The gap was this. `hasOpen` certified `findUnexpandedWithApplied … = none`, not
`findUnexpanded … = none`, and the two differed by the D4 orphan situation: the applied set
could record a formula no longer on the branch, because a *consumable* rule deleted a formula
a *persistent* rule had produced. The persistent rule was then suppressed by the applied set,
the branch was reported saturated, and `findUnexpanded` — which does not consult the applied
set — still found work.

**The original diagnosis was wrong, and the correction is the point.** It was believed that
several persistent rules return `.persistent fs` even when every element of `fs` is already on
the branch, so that requiring `findUnexpanded … = none` would stall the pipeline. Every
`.persistent` return site in `applyRule` was subsequently checked: all of them are already
branch-guarded, and the one that is not (`densityRule`) emits at a fresh time, where its output
cannot be on the branch by construction. Nothing was wrong with the persistent rules. The cycle
was driven entirely by **destruction** in the `.linear`/`.branching` arms of `expandOnce`, which
deleted the source of every consumable rule; the applied set existed only to paper over that.

The repair is therefore in the destructive arms, not the persistent ones: guard `.linear` and
`.branching` the way `.persistent` already guards itself, stop deleting, and the applied set has
nothing left to do. `findUnexpanded … = none` is then reachable, and it means exactly downward
saturation, with no auxiliary invariant. `Tests/BimodalTest/TableauConformance.lean`'s
`CertificateProbe` pins the result on the old witness: `◇p` now reports
`fullySaturated=true applied=0 orphans=0`.

**`AppliedRedundant` was refuted, not merely unproved.** The predicate below was believed true
of the pipeline's output and was to be proved invariant under `expandBranchWithFuel`. Measured
over a spread of formulas at `.Base`, fuel 200, it is **false** on `◇(p ∧ q)`, `◇◇p`, `◇¬¬p` and
`◇(□(p ∧ q) ∧ ¬p)`; the original `◇p` witness is unrepresentative, its three orphans all
happening to sit one `negPos` step from the branch. The mechanism is structural rather than
incidental: `appliedEntryRedundant` is a **one-step** predicate, and the engine decomposes to
arbitrary depth, so an entry's rule outputs are themselves consumed one level further down. A
transitive strengthening does not repair it either — `findApplicableRule`'s `.persistent` output
set grows with the branch, so the predicate is not monotone in `b` and the induction step for a
growing branch does not go through.

The two definitions are kept only so this record has something to point at.
-/

/--
One applied-set entry is redundant on a branch when the branch either still carries it or
carries what its rule would produce.

The `.branching` arm asks for *some* branch's outputs, not all: a branching rule's
conclusion is a disjunction, and the branch under consideration took one disjunct.
-/
def appliedEntryRedundant (b : Branch) (ord : TimeOrdering) (fc : FrameClass)
    (f : SignedFormula) : Bool :=
  b.contains f ||
    (match findApplicableRule f b ord fc with
     | some (_, .linear fs, _) => fs.all b.contains
     | some (_, .persistent fs, _) => fs.all b.contains
     | some (_, .branching bss, _) => bss.any fun fs => fs.all b.contains
     -- An ordered split's arms are replacement branches, not outputs, so "the branch already

     | some (_, .branchingOrdered _, _) => false
     | _ => false)

/--
The strengthened open-branch certificate (R5): every applied-set entry is redundant on the
branch, so nothing the applied set suppressed has been silently lost.

Together with the `saturated` field already carried by `ExpandedTableau.hasOpen`, this is
the hypothesis the truth lemma consumes. See the section docstring above for the choice
between this and full `findUnexpanded` saturation, and for the `◇p` measurement.

## Time-Order Totality Gate

The bridge from a saturated open branch to a countermodel needs the branch's times to carry
a *linear* order, not merely the partial order the constraint list records. `timeOrderTotal`
is that requirement made decidable, so it can be measured before it is delivered and pinned
as a regression signal afterwards.

**This is a gate, not a theorem.** It is currently `false` on a family of open certificates —
`¬(F(G p) ∧ F(¬p))`, `¬(F p ∧ F q)`, `¬(F(G p) ∧ F(G q))`, `¬(F(¬p) ∧ F(G p))` all saturate
with two incomparable sibling times, unchanged at fuel 200 and 2000. Those rows are pinned in
`Tests/BimodalTest/TableauConformance.lean` (`TimeOrderProbe`) with their current verdicts;
the rule that makes them `true` is the order-level branching rule, and flipping them is its
done-criterion.

**Why `orderTrichotomy` does not already deliver this.** `orderTrichotomy`'s branches are
`temp_linearity` *formulas*, which mint fresh witness times rather than ordering the two
existing incomparable ones. It is sound and it closed counterexample B; it is the
formula-level companion to an order-level rule, not a substitute for one.

**Do not try to repair this after the fact.** Taking the branch's partial order and extending
it to a linear order — Mathlib's `extend_partialOrder`/`LinearExtension` — is *unsound* here.
In `¬(F(G p) ∧ F(¬p))` the two incomparable siblings carry `T(G p)` and `F(p)`; the extension
placing the `G p` time first forces `p` true exactly where the branch asserts `F(p)`. The
formula is satisfiable, so one of the two extensions is a model and the other is not, and
nothing on the branch records which. The calculus has to branch on the order; the model
construction cannot choose it afterwards.

A caveat on reading a `false` here: `Branch.knownTimes` is `(b.map (·.label.time)).eraseDups`,
so a time mentioned only in `ord.constraints` — one whose formulas were all consumed — is not
quantified over. In the four rows above the constraints are `[(0,2),(0,1)]` while
`knownTimes = [2,1]`, so the *induced* order on `knownTimes` is empty and the incomparability
is partly an artifact of destructive expansion. Non-destructive expansion keeps the root's
formulas and hence the root time, which is why it should land first.
-/

/--
Every pair of times known to the branch is comparable under the (transitive) ordering.

Decidable by construction, so it can be carried as a field of an open-branch certificate and
consumed as the totality hypothesis of a `LinearOrder` on the branch's times.

## Fuel-Based Expansion

/--
Scan a branch for Until/Since formulas and register them as pending eventualities.

For each `T(U(event, guard))` or `T(S(event, guard))` on the branch, we register
an eventuality for the `event` component. The event must eventually be witnessed
at some reachable time for the branch to be satisfiable.

      else acc
    | _, _ => acc
  ) tracker

/--
Check if any pending eventualities are fulfilled on the branch.

An Until eventuality for formula `event` introduced at label `l` is fulfilled when
`T(event)` appears at some future time reachable from `l.time`.
A Since eventuality is fulfilled when `T(event)` appears at some past time.

## Branch Difficulty Estimation

Heuristic for proportional fuel allocation at tableau branch splits.
Branches with more temporal operators (which cause exponential branching)
receive more fuel than purely propositional branches.
-/

/--
Count temporal operators (Until/Since) in a formula.
These are the primary source of branching complexity in the tableau.
-/
private def temporalCount : Formula → Nat
  | .atom _ => 0
  | .bot => 0
  | .imp φ ψ => temporalCount φ + temporalCount ψ
  | .box φ => temporalCount φ
  | .untl ψ φ => 1 + temporalCount φ + temporalCount ψ
  | .snce ψ φ => 1 + temporalCount φ + temporalCount ψ

/--
Count modal operators (Box) in a formula.
Box propagates formulas to all accessible worlds.
-/
private def modalCount : Formula → Nat
  | .atom _ => 0
  | .bot => 0
  | .imp φ ψ => modalCount φ + modalCount ψ
  | .box φ => 1 + modalCount φ
  | .untl ψ φ => modalCount φ + modalCount ψ
  | .snce ψ φ => modalCount φ + modalCount ψ

/--
Estimate the difficulty of expanding a branch.

Uses a weighted sum of three metrics:
- **Temporal operator count** (weight 3): Until/Since cause branching + fresh time points
- **Modal operator count** (weight 2): Box propagates to all worlds
- **Branch size** (weight 1/4): Minor per-step cost factor

The minimum return value is 1 to avoid division-by-zero in proportional allocation.
-/
def estimateBranchDifficulty (b : Branch) : Nat :=
  let tempCount := b.foldl (fun acc sf => acc + temporalCount sf.formula) 0
  let modCount := b.foldl (fun acc sf => acc + modalCount sf.formula) 0
  let sizeWeight := b.length / 4
  1 + 3 * tempCount + 2 * modCount + sizeWeight

/--
Allocate fuel proportionally to branch difficulty.

Given total `fuel` and a list of branches, computes per-branch fuel allocations
weighted by `estimateBranchDifficulty`. Each allocation is:
- At least 1 (when fuel > 0) to ensure progress
- At most `fuel - 1` to preserve termination (strict decrease for `decreasing_by`)
- When `fuel = 0`, all allocations are 0

The sum of allocations may be less than `fuel` (remainder is lost), which is
acceptable since the original uniform allocation also loses remainder from division.
-/
def allocateFuelProportionally (fuel : Nat) (branches : List Branch) : List Nat :=
  match fuel with
  | 0 => branches.map fun _ => 0
  | fuel + 1 =>
    let difficulties := branches.map estimateBranchDifficulty
    let totalDifficulty := difficulties.foldl (· + ·) 0
    difficulties.map fun d =>
      -- Proportional share: (totalFuel * difficulty) / totalDifficulty
      -- Capped at `fuel` (= totalFuel - 1) to ensure strict decrease for termination
      -- At least 1 when fuel ≥ 1 (i.e., totalFuel ≥ 2)
      min (max 1 (fuel.succ * d / max 1 totalDifficulty)) fuel

/--
Every element of `allocateFuelProportionally (fuel+1) branches` is at most `fuel`.
This is the key lemma for the termination proof of `expandBranchWithFuel`.
-/
theorem allocateFuelProportionally_le (fuel : Nat) (branches : List Branch)
    (n : Nat) (h : n ∈ allocateFuelProportionally (fuel + 1) branches) :
    n ≤ fuel := by
  simp only [allocateFuelProportionally] at h
  rw [List.mem_map] at h
  obtain ⟨d, _, rfl⟩ := h
  exact Nat.min_le_right _ _

## Post-Blocking Saturation

When `expandBranchWithFuel` returns a blocked open branch, the branch
may still contain unexpanded formulas (propositional, modal, or
persistent temporal formulas that don't create new time points).

`saturateBlocked` continues expansion on such branches, rejecting any
expansion step that would introduce new time ordering constraints.
This ensures the branch reaches full saturation or closure without
generating new time points that would bypass blocking.
-/

/--
Continue expanding a blocked branch until saturated or closed,
rejecting any expansion step that introduces new time constraints.
Uses fuel to ensure termination.

Each step either:
- Closes the branch (new formulas create a contradiction)
- Applies a non-time-generating rule (propositional, modal, persistent with no new times)
- Reaches saturation (no more applicable non-time-generating rules)

Since no new time points are created, the expansion terminates
when all propositional/modal formulas are processed.

Mirrored by `saturateBlockedCancellable` (CancellableExpansion.lean);
keep the two in sync.

## Resolving an Open Sub-Branch Inside a Split

A sub-branch that comes back `.inr` from `expandBranchWithFuel` is open in the *unblocked*
sense only: `expandOnceUnblockedWithApplied` found no applicable rule on an unblocked time,
which is weaker than `findUnexpanded = none`. Such a branch may still close once the
post-blocking pass (`saturateBlocked`) runs the label-free rules that blocking skipped.

That weaker notion is what made the split fold unsound. The fold short-circuited on the first
sub-branch reported `.inr` and abandoned the remaining arms; `buildTableau` then ran
`saturateBlocked` on the returned branch, closed it, and reported `.allClosed` — counting the
abandoned siblings as closed. A verdict of *valid* was then produced for an invalid formula.

The repair is to settle each arm **where the siblings are still in scope**, rather than
handing a not-yet-settled branch up to a caller that has forgotten them. `resolveOpenArm`
performs exactly the resolution `buildTableau` used to perform, and reports it in a form the
fold can act on:

- `some (.inl _)` — this arm is genuinely closed; the fold continues with its siblings;
- `some (.inr r)` — this arm is genuinely open and **blocking-aware saturated**
  (`findUnexpandedUnblocked … = none`), so it is a real countermodel witness *relative to the
  blocked set* and short-circuiting on it is sound;
- `none` — undecided: the arm is neither closed nor blocking-aware saturated. Reporting `none`
  propagates as fuel exhaustion, which is the honest answer; it is never converted into a
  closure.

The last case is the one that keeps the repair sound rather than merely different: an arm
that cannot be settled must not be silently counted as closed.

### Why the test is `findUnexpandedUnblocked`, not `findUnexpanded`

Both decision points below previously used `findUnexpanded` — the **literal** saturation test.
That is not the test the engine itself uses: `expandOnceUnblockedWithApplied` reports
`.saturated` off `findUnexpandedUnblocked`, and `Tableau.lean` names the latter "the engine's
real saturation test" in so many words.

Testing an arm with the literal test after the post-blocking pass has run is a permanent
disagreement, not a transient one. `saturateBlocked` **by construction refuses** any expansion
step that would introduce a new time point; `findUnexpanded` **counts** exactly such
label-introducing work as outstanding. So whenever loop-blocking defers label-introducing work
— which is precisely what blocking exists to do — `saturateBlocked` cannot discharge it and
`findUnexpanded` cannot stop reporting it. The arm then falls to the `none` branch at *every*
fuel figure and *every* branch budget, because neither quantity appears in the disagreement.

That was measured, not conjectured: `φ = F(G p)` and `φ = ¬G(F p)` returned `none` from
`expandBranchWithFuel` at every tested pair
`(fuel, maxBranches) ∈ {500, 8000, 50000, 229376, 300000} × {50000, 10⁹, 10¹²}`, always via
this arm and never via the fuel or budget guards. Substituting the engine's real test converts
those to clean open verdicts and leaves already-succeeding formulas (`U(p,q)` and the rest of
the corpus) unchanged. The probes at the end of this section pin both halves of that claim.

**Which blocked set.** `findUnexpandedUnblocked` derives its blocked set from an
`EventualityTracker`, and `resolveOpenArm`'s signature carries none. The tracker argument is
therefore *decided here and written out*, rather than left to the `EventualityTracker.empty`
default, because the default is the wrong direction and it is worth saying why.

`isTemporallyBlockedSaturated` requires `allEventualitiesFulfilledOrDuplicated tracker t t_anc`,
which quantifies over `tracker.pendingAtTime t`. Under `EventualityTracker.empty` that list is
empty and the condition holds **vacuously**, so *more* times count as blocked, so *fewer*
formulas are candidates, so the saturation test is *easier* to pass. The empty tracker is the
permissive extreme, not the conservative one — precisely the direction in which a blocking
engine must not be sloppy, since it is what would let an arm be declared open over an
outstanding Until/Since obligation.

Both call sites below therefore use `armTracker ob`, which recomputes the arm's eventualities
from the arm's own branch (`fulfillEventualities` after `registerEventualities`, seeded from
empty). Two facts make this the right set:

* It is **self-contained**: no tracker has to be threaded in, so `resolveOpenArm`'s signature is
  unchanged and neither the enclosing folds nor the cancellable mirror's signature move.
* It is **at least as strict as the engine's own**: the engine seeds `registerEventualities`
  with an inherited tracker that `fulfillEventualities` may already have pruned, whereas
  recomputing from empty re-derives every pending entry the arm's formulas justify. More
  pending entries means a harder blocking condition, means fewer blocked times, means a harder
  saturation test. So this test never declares an arm saturated that the engine's own blocking
  set would have left unsaturated.

The certificate this function issues is relative to `blockedTimes ob ord fc (armTracker ob)`.

**Soundness scope.** This changes what an arm reported open certifies: from "no formula on this
branch has an applicable rule" to "no formula at an *unblocked* time has an applicable rule".
`ExpandedTableau.hasOpen` is **not** weakened by this — it still carries the literal
`findUnexpanded … = none` field, and every downstream truth-lemma and countermodel-extraction
consumer reads that unchanged field. The weaker notion is carried by a separate, explicitly
named certificate (`BudgetedTableau`, added alongside `buildTableau` further down this file),
never by silently reinterpreting the existing one.
-/

/--
The eventuality tracker for a branch, recomputed from that branch alone: register every
eventuality its formulas justify, then discharge the ones the branch already witnesses.

This is the tracker `resolveOpenArm` and `buildTableauAt` test saturation against. Seeding from
`EventualityTracker.empty` rather than from an inherited tracker is deliberate and is the
conservative direction — see the section prose above.

/--
Settle a sub-branch that `expandBranchWithFuel` returned as open, before the enclosing split
fold decides whether to keep exploring its siblings.

Returns `some (.inl _)` if the arm actually closes under post-blocking saturation,
`some (.inr _)` if it is open *and* blocking-aware saturated
(`findUnexpandedUnblocked … = none`, relative to the arm's own recomputed blocked set — see
the section prose above for why that is the notion and which set it is), and `none` if it
cannot be settled.

`resolveOpenArm_inr` records the invariant the soundness proof needs: whenever this reports
an open branch, that branch has no closure reason.

**Mirror drift, declared.** `resolveOpenArmCancellable` in `CancellableExpansion.lean`
transcribes this body and has **not** been updated: it still tests with the literal
`findUnexpanded` at both of its decision points, and its two call sites inside
`expandBranchWithFuelCancellable`'s `.split` and `.splitOrdered` folds therefore still exhibit
the permanent disagreement described above. `CancellableExpansion.lean` is outside the file
scope of the change that repaired this function, so the divergence is recorded here rather than
silently repaired. The cancellable runtime path is `IO`-only and feeds no verified result; a
follow-up owning `CancellableExpansion.lean` should apply the same two-line swap.

`resolveOpenArm` never reports an open branch that has a closure reason.

input branch unchanged, so the caller's invariant carries over (`h_ob`); the post-blocking case
returns a branch it has just checked with `findClosure` itself.

## Trace-Instrumented Expansion

These functions mirror `expandBranchWithFuel` but additionally thread a
`ProofCertificate` through a `StateM` layer, recording a `TraceEntry` for
each rule firing, branch closure, blocking event, and fuel exhaustion.

The original `expandBranchWithFuel` is preserved unchanged (with all four
termination/soundness proofs intact). The `_tracedImpl` functions use a
parallel implementation so that the existing proofs remain valid.
-/

/--
Perform a single expansion step and record the corresponding `TraceEntry`.

The `_tracedImpl` function is a pure `StateM` wrapper around
`expandOnceWithApplied`. It does not call `applyRule` directly; instead it
inspects the same `findUnexpandedWithApplied` / `findApplicableRuleWithApplied`
calls to determine which rule fired (so the same `applyRule` arms are
non-invasively covered). This preserves the existing implementation of
`applyRule` so that all proofs of its arms continue to compile.

For each expansion:
- `findUnexpandedWithApplied` yields the source signed formula `sf`.
- `findApplicableRuleWithApplied` yields the `TableauRule`, the `RuleResult`,
  and the formulas added to the applied set.
- A `TraceEntry.ruleFired` is recorded with the source's `(sign, formula, label)`,
  the rule, the produced formulas, whether the rule is `persistent`, and a
  `branchDepth` (the size of the current branch).
- If the result is `.branching`, a `TraceEntry.branchCreated` is recorded for
  each new sub-branch.
- If `findUnexpandedWithApplied` returned `none`, no entry is recorded (the
  branch is saturated).

/--
Trace-instrumented version of `expandBranchWithFuel`.

Recursively expands a branch, recording:
- A `ruleFired` entry on every expansion step.
- A `branchCreated` entry on every split.
- A `branchClosed` entry when a branch closes.
- A `blockingFired` entry when subset blocking fires.
- A `fuelExhausted` entry when fuel runs out.

The recursion shape mirrors `expandBranchWithFuel` exactly (with a smaller
`fuel` in the recursive call), so the same `termination_by fuel` measure
applies.

Returns the same `Option (ClosedBranch ⊕ ...)` shape as the original,
plus the final `ProofCertificate` in the resulting `StateM` state.

## Main Expansion Function
-/

/--
Build a complete tableau for proving ¬φ is unsatisfiable (i.e., φ is valid).

Starts with F(φ) (asserting φ is false) and expands until:
- All branches close → φ is valid
- Some branch saturates open → φ is invalid

Uses fuel parameter for termination. The fuel should be set based on
the formula's complexity.

When `expandBranchWithFuel` returns a blocked open branch that is not
yet saturated, `saturateBlocked` continues expansion of non-time-generating
rules to reach full saturation.

Mirrored by `buildTableauCancellable` (CancellableExpansion.lean);
keep the two in sync.

Recommended fuel based on formula complexity.

**Deprecated**: Use `soundFuel` for a theoretically justified bound.
This function is kept for backward compatibility.
-/
def recommendedFuel (φ : Formula) : Nat :=
  10 * φ.complexity + 100

/--
Sound fuel bound derived from the Finite Model Property (FMP).

By the FMP for bimodal TM logic, a satisfiable formula φ has a model
with at most `2^n` distinct worlds/times, where `n = |subformulaClosure(φ)|`.
Each time point can carry at most `2^n` distinct subsets of signed subformulas,
so the tableau explores at most `2^(2n)` distinct time-types before a repeat
(and blocking fires). We cap at 100000 for practical performance since
blocking typically fires much earlier.

The bound `n * 2^n` is used instead of `2^(2n)` because each expansion step
produces at most a constant number of new signed formulas, so the total
expansion steps are bounded by the number of distinct (time, type) pairs,
which is at most `n * 2^n` where n accounts for the time points and `2^n`
for the types.

/-! ## Arm-Settling Probes

Evidence rows for the `resolveOpenArm` repair (see "Why the test is `findUnexpandedUnblocked`,
not `findUnexpanded`" above). These are checkable by *running*, not by reading, which is the
point: the claim being pinned is a behavioural one.

The first three rows are the ones that were measured to fail before the repair.
`F(G p)` and `¬G(F p)` returned `none` from `expandBranchWithFuel` at every tested pair
`(fuel, maxBranches) ∈ {500, 8000, 50000, 229376, 300000} × {50000, 10⁹, 10¹²}`, always through
`resolveOpenArm`'s undecided arm and never through the fuel or `maxBranches` guards. They now
settle. `U(p,q)` is the control: it succeeded before and is unchanged.

The last two rows say what the repair did *not* do. `buildTableau` still tests with the literal
`findUnexpanded` at its own two top-level decision points — deliberately, since those feed the
dependently-typed `ExpandedTableau.hasOpen` constructor whose proof field is
`findUnexpanded … = none` and which downstream consumers read. So `buildTableau (F(G p))` is
still `none`; the budget-parameterised entry point below is what settles it.

`armDisagreement` exhibits the mechanism directly: at the branch `expandBranchWithFuel` hands
back for `F(G p)`, the literal test reports work outstanding (`true`) while the engine's real
test reports saturation (`false`). That standing disagreement — `saturateBlocked` refusing to
mint time points, `findUnexpanded` counting them — is the whole of the defect.

## Blocking Correctness and Termination Theorems

The following theorems state the key correctness properties of the subset
blocking strategy. The soundness side is discharged here — `subformula_property`
and `blocking_sound` below are proved outright. The termination side remains
open; see "Blocking termination: known issues and status" for the two identified
failure modes and the fuel bound still to be derived.

### Completeness Preservation Argument (from research report)

**Why subset blocking is sound**: Let B be a tableau branch and t a time
point whose type τ(t) ⊆ τ(t_anc) for some ancestor t_anc. If B is
satisfiable, then any model M satisfying τ(t_anc) also satisfies τ(t)
(since τ(t) is a subset). Therefore, blocking expansion at t cannot
cause a satisfiable branch to be incorrectly closed -- it can only
prevent the creation of redundant time points.

**Why blocking ensures termination**: The subformula closure of the
initial formula φ has n = |subformulaClosure(φ)| elements. Each time
type is a subset of {T, F} × subformulaClosure(φ), so there are at
most 2^(2n) distinct time types. By the pigeonhole principle, any
chain of time points longer than 2^(2n) must contain a repeat
(equality blocking) or a subset relation (subset blocking). Since
subset blocking is more aggressive than equality blocking, it fires
at least as early.

**Eventuality safety**: When τ(t) ⊆ τ(t_anc), any pending Until/Since
eventuality at t is also pending at t_anc (by the subset relation).
Since the ancestor time was already expanded, the eventuality was
either fulfilled along the ancestor's expansion path, or it will
cause the ancestor's branch to remain open. In either case, blocking
at t does not lose eventuality information.
-/

/--
**Subformula property**: All formulas produced by tableau rule application
are members of the signed subformula closure of the initial formula.

This is the foundation of the termination argument: since the closure is
finite, and each time type is a subset of the closure, there are only
finitely many distinct time types.

### Blocking termination: known issues and status

The original theorem `blocking_terminates : (buildTableau φ (soundFuel φ)).isSome`
was found to be FALSE during implementation.

**Two independent failure modes were identified:**

1. **Blocked-but-not-saturated branches** (addressed): When `expandBranchWithFuel`
   returns a blocked open branch, the branch may contain unexpanded propositional
   or modal formulas. The original `buildTableau` rejected such branches. This was
   fixed by adding `saturateBlocked` to continue non-time-generating expansion
   after blocking fires.

2. **Persistent rule loops** (RESOLVED): Persistent rules like
   `boxPos` (`T(□ψ)` propagates `T(ψ)` to all worlds) interact badly with
   consumable rules like `negPos` (`T(φ → ⊥)` → `F(φ)`). When `boxPos` adds
   `T(ψ)` and `negPos` immediately consumes it, `boxPos` no longer sees `T(ψ)`
   in the branch and re-adds it, creating an infinite loop that exhausts fuel.
   **Fix**: An `AppliedSet` (defined in `Tableau.lean`) tracks signed formulas
   already produced by persistent rules. `expandOnceWithApplied` filters out
   persistent rule outputs that are already in the applied set, preventing
   re-application. The applied set is threaded through `expandBranchWithFuel`
   and carried in `ExpandedTableau.hasOpen` for saturation verification.
   Counterexample `◇p` now terminates correctly with an open branch.

**Prerequisite for a correct termination theorem:**
With the persistent rule loop (issue 2) resolved, the termination theorem
now depends only on:

Once the loop is fixed, the termination theorem would follow from:
1. Generalized subformula property (case analysis over ~25 rules in `applyRule`)
2. Pigeonhole argument: at most `2^(2n)` distinct time types → blocking fires
3. Fuel bound derivation from the time-type bound (requires removing the `min`
   cap in `soundFuel` or proving the cap is sufficient)

3. **Exponential branching in split case** (RESOLVED): In the split
   case, each sub-branch previously received the full remaining fuel, leading to
   O(2^fuel) worst-case work. **Fix**: Fuel is now divided among sub-branches:
   `branchFuel = fuel / max(1, branches.length)`. The soundness proof was updated
   to use strong induction (`Nat.strongRecOn`) to handle the reduced fuel value.

4. **Eventuality-aware blocking** (RESOLVED): Subset blocking could
   prematurely cut off branches where Until/Since eventualities were unfulfilled.
   **Fix**: `findBlockedTime` now accepts an `EventualityTracker` parameter.
   Blocking only fires when `allEventualitiesFulfilledOrDuplicated` confirms that
   all pending eventualities at the blocked time are either fulfilled or also
   pending at the blocking ancestor.

**Correct properties that ARE proven:**
- `expandBranchWithFuel_sound`: Open branches returned by expansion have no
  closure reason (`findClosure = none`). Uses strong induction for fuel-divided
  sub-branches.
- `subformula_property`: Initial branch formulas are subformulas of the input

Ordered-split analogue of `tryBranch_inr`.

The only difference is where the recursive call gets its `TimeOrdering`: from the pair itself
(`pair.1.2`) rather than from a single ordering shared across the split. The invariant being
preserved says nothing about the ordering — `expandBranchWithFuel_sound`'s induction hypothesis
is universally quantified over it — so the proof is the same case analysis.

**Blocking soundness**: Subset blocking does not prematurely close any
satisfiable branch. If a branch B is satisfiable and expandBranchWithFuel
returns `some (.inr openBranch)` due to blocking, then `openBranch` is
indeed satisfiable.

This follows from the structural invariant of `expandBranchWithFuel`:
every code path that returns `.inr` (open branch) first verifies
`findClosure = none`. The proof tracks this invariant through the
recursive structure, including the `List.foldl` in the branch-split case.

## The Budget-Parameterised Entry Point

Everything in this section is an **addition**. `buildTableau`, its `fuel := 1000` /
`fc := .Base` defaults, `expandBranchWithFuel`'s `maxBranches := 50000` default, and
`ExpandedTableau.hasOpen`'s `findUnexpanded … = none` proof field are all untouched, and the
verified corpus that reads them is unaffected.

Two things are added, for two different reasons.

**`buildTableauAt` exists because `maxBranches` must be quantifiable.** `buildTableau` fixes it
at the engine default by not exposing it at all. A totality statement has to be able to say
"at *this* budget", so the budget has to be a parameter.

**`BudgetedTableau` exists because the honest open certificate for a blocking engine is not
`ExpandedTableau`'s.** `ExpandedTableau.hasOpen` carries the *literal*
`findUnexpanded … = none`. For the class of formulas whose refutation requires an infinite
descent that loop-blocking cuts, that field is permanently unobtainable — `saturateBlocked`
refuses to mint the time points, `findUnexpanded` keeps counting them, and no fuel figure or
branch budget touches the disagreement (see the arm-settling section above for the measured
census). `BudgetedTableau.hasOpen` carries the blocking-aware field instead, **and says which
blocked set it is relative to** by carrying the tracker as a field rather than leaving it
implicit.

This is strictly weaker than `ExpandedTableau.hasOpen`, and the weakening is not hidden: no
existing declaration is redefined, no consumer silently receives the weaker notion, and
`BudgetedTableau.upgrade` below shows a consumer that needs the strong certificate can still
obtain one — but only under the strong condition, which is exactly the right price.
-/

/--
The blocking-aware twin of `ExpandedTableau`.

- `allClosed` — identical in force to `ExpandedTableau.allClosed`.
- `hasOpen` — carries `findUnexpandedUnblockedWith … = none` (the engine's *real* saturation
  test) together with the `EventualityTracker` the blocked set was computed from, so the
  certificate names its own frame of reference instead of leaving it to a default.

**How this is weaker than `ExpandedTableau.hasOpen`, precisely.** `findUnexpanded … = none`
says *no* formula on the branch has an applicable rule. This field says no formula *at an
unblocked time* does. The gap is exactly the formulas sitting at times blocked by a saturated
ancestor. For a blocking engine that gap is not an imperfection to be closed later: it is what
blocking is, and a certificate that refused to admit it would be unobtainable rather than
strong. See `upgrade` for the bridge back.

**The upgrade bridge.** A consumer that needs `ExpandedTableau`'s strong certificate can still
get one from a `BudgetedTableau` — but only by paying the strong condition, which this function
checks rather than assumes. `allClosed` upgrades unconditionally (it says the same thing in
both types); `hasOpen` upgrades exactly when the literal saturation test also passes.

The point of stating it this way is that nothing downstream is weakened by the existence of
`BudgetedTableau`: `upgrade_hasOpen_isSome_iff` below says the bridge succeeds *iff* the strong
condition holds, so no path exists from a blocking-aware certificate to a literal one that does
not go through the literal condition.

`findUnexpandedUnblockedWith` is a restriction of `findUnexpanded`: it searches the same list
with a strictly stronger predicate. So finding unblocked work implies finding work.

This is the one arithmetic-free fact the pinning lemma needs, and it is the direction that
holds. The converse fails, and that failure is the whole content of the arm-settling repair.

Build a tableau at an explicitly given branch budget, certifying openness with the engine's
real (blocking-aware) saturation test.

Arm for arm this is `buildTableau`, with exactly two differences, both forced:

1. `maxBranches` is threaded into `expandBranchWithFuel` instead of being left at the engine
   default, because a budget that cannot be named cannot be quantified over.
2. Both top-level saturation tests are `findUnexpandedUnblockedWith … (blockedTimes …
   (armTracker …))` rather than `findUnexpanded …`, matching the repaired `resolveOpenArm` and
   producing the `BudgetedTableau` certificate rather than the `ExpandedTableau` one.

`buildTableau` itself is not touched, not wrapped, and not re-expressed in terms of this
function. `buildTableauAt_allClosed_imp` records the relation between the two that is actually
provable.

**The pinning lemma.** At the engine's own default budget, a closed verdict from the new entry
point is a closed verdict from the frozen one. This is what keeps the existing verified corpus
honest about the addition: nothing `buildTableauAt` calls valid at `50000` is anything
`buildTableau` would have called otherwise.

**The converse is false, and deliberately not asserted.** `buildTableau` can report `allClosed`
where `buildTableauAt` reports `hasOpen`: precisely when the literal test finds outstanding
work at the top-level open branch, the blocking-aware test does not, and the post-blocking pass
would have closed the branch. That is the same disagreement the arm-settling repair addresses,
and it is a genuine difference in verdict, not a proof gap — so it is recorded here as a
statement about the two functions rather than papered over with an unproved `iff`.

/--
**Top-level closure freedom**, the `resolveOpenArm_inr` analogue for `buildTableauAt`.

The disjunction is not hedging: the first disjunct is *proved* and covers the branch reported
open directly by expansion; the second disjunct names the one remaining route, through the
post-blocking pass, and it is named rather than discharged because **it cannot be discharged**.
`saturateBlocked` returning `.inr` does not imply the returned branch is closure-free: take a
branch `b` with `findClosure b = none` whose single label-free expansion step reaches a branch
`nb` that closes, and run `saturateBlocked b 1`. The recursive call is at fuel `0`, whose base
case returns `(nb, ord)` unexamined. So `saturateBlocked_sound` is false as an unconditional
statement, and remains deferred as a conditional one.

`buildTableau` has the identical gap at the identical arm — it is inherited, not introduced
here — and `resolveOpenArm` is the one caller that guards against it, with its own
`findClosure satBr` check.

The row that matters: at a budget the research measured `buildTableau` returning `none` on,
`buildTableauAt` settles. `buildTableau` is re-evaluated alongside so the two verdicts sit in
the same file and drift together if either changes.

## Active Until/Since Negative Rule Tests

These tests verify that the active untlNeg/snceNeg rules correctly create
fresh time points when no future/past times exist, enabling countermodel
construction for formulas that previously caused premature saturation or
timeout.

The key innovation is that F(U(event, guard)) at a time with no future
times will now create a fresh future time and perform Reynolds
co-decomposition there, rather than returning notApplicable.
