# Signed Formula and Branch Types for Tableau Decidability

This module defines the core types for tableau-based decision procedures:
- `Sign`: Positive (asserted true) or negative (asserted false)
- `SignedFormula`: A formula with a sign
- `Branch`: A list of signed formulas representing a tableau branch

## Main Definitions

- `Sign`: Inductive type with `pos` and `neg` constructors
- `SignedFormula`: Structure combining sign and formula
- `Branch`: Type alias for `List SignedFormula`
- `Formula.subformulas`: Collect all subformulas of a formula
- `subformulaClosure`: Compute the subformula closure

## Implementation Notes

The tableau method works by maintaining branches of signed formulas.
A positive sign means the formula is asserted true, negative means false.
The tableau systematically expands formulas until branches close (contradiction)
or saturate (open branch = countermodel).

A label combining world and time indices for tableau signed formulas.
Each signed formula carries a label indicating the world and time at which
it is asserted.

## Signed Formula Type
-/

/--
A signed formula is a formula with a sign indicating truth assertion.

- `sign = pos`: The formula is asserted to be true
- `sign = neg`: The formula is asserted to be false

In tableau calculus, we start with the negation of the goal (sign = neg)
and expand until all branches close or we find an open saturated branch.
-/

  /-- The sign indicating truth or falsity assertion. -/

## Branch Type
-/

/--
A branch is a list of signed formulas in a tableau.

Branches grow as tableau rules are applied. A branch is closed if it
contains a contradiction (both T(φ) and F(φ) for some formula φ, or T(⊥)).
A branch is open if it is saturated (all rules applied) and not closed.
-/
abbrev Branch := List SignedFormula

namespace Branch

/-- Empty branch. -/
def empty : Branch := []

/-- Check if branch contains a specific signed formula. -/
def contains (b : Branch) (sf : SignedFormula) : Bool :=
  b.any (· == sf)

/-- Check if branch contains a positive formula at the initial label. -/
def hasPos (b : Branch) (φ : Formula) : Bool :=
  b.contains (SignedFormula.pos φ)

/-- Check if branch contains a negative formula at the initial label. -/
def hasNeg (b : Branch) (φ : Formula) : Bool :=
  b.contains (SignedFormula.neg φ)

/-- Check if branch contains T(φ) at a specific label. -/
def hasPosAt (b : Branch) (φ : Formula) (l : Label) : Bool :=

/-- Check if branch contains F(φ) at a specific label. -/
def hasNegAt (b : Branch) (φ : Formula) (l : Label) : Bool :=
  b.contains (SignedFormula.neg φ l)

/-- Check if branch contains T(⊥) at any label. -/
def hasBotPos (b : Branch) : Bool :=
  b.any fun sf => sf.sign == .pos && sf.formula == .bot

/--
Check if branch has a direct contradiction: both T(φ) and F(φ) at the same label.
Returns `some φ` if contradiction found, `none` otherwise.
-/
def findContradiction (b : Branch) : Option Formula :=
  b.findSome? fun sf =>
    if sf.isPos ∧ b.hasNegAt sf.formula sf.label then some sf.formula
    else none

/-- Check if branch has any contradiction (T(⊥) or complementary pair). -/
def hasContradiction (b : Branch) : Bool :=
  b.hasBotPos || b.findContradiction.isSome

/-- Get all positive formulas in the branch. -/
def positives (b : Branch) : List Formula :=

/-- Extend branch with a signed formula. -/
def extend (b : Branch) (sf : SignedFormula) : Branch := sf :: b

/-- Extend branch with multiple signed formulas. -/
def extendMany (b : Branch) (sfs : List SignedFormula) : Branch := sfs ++ b

/-- Total complexity of all formulas in branch. -/
def totalComplexity (b : Branch) : Nat :=
  b.foldl (fun acc sf => acc + sf.complexity) 0

/--
Collect all distinct world indices from signed formulas in the branch.
Used by S5 modal rules to know which worlds exist for universal propagation.
-/
def knownWorlds (b : Branch) : List WorldIndex :=
  (b.map (·.label.world)).eraseDups

/--
Maximum world index in the branch (0 if empty).
Used to compute the next fresh world index.
-/
def maxWorld (b : Branch) : WorldIndex :=
  b.foldl (fun acc sf => max acc sf.label.world) 0

/--
Next fresh world index (one past the maximum).
Used by existential modal rules to introduce witness worlds.
-/
def nextWorld (b : Branch) : WorldIndex :=
  b.maxWorld + 1

/--
Collect all T(□A) formulas in the branch (positive box formulas).
These are universal modal formulas that must be propagated to every known world.
-/
def boxPosFormulas (b : Branch) : List SignedFormula :=
  b.filter fun sf =>
    match sf.sign, sf.formula with
    | .pos, .box _ => true
    | _, _ => false

/--
Collect all F(◇A) formulas in the branch (negative diamond formulas).
These are universal modal formulas that must be propagated to every known world.
F(◇A) = F(¬□¬A) means □¬A holds, so ¬A must hold at every world.
Diamond encoding: ◇A = ¬□¬A = (.imp (.box (.imp A .bot)) .bot)
-/
def diamondNegFormulas (b : Branch) : List SignedFormula :=
  b.filter fun sf =>
    match sf.sign, sf.formula with
    | .neg, .imp (.box (.imp _ .bot)) .bot => true
    | _, _ => false

/--
Collect all distinct time indices from signed formulas in the branch.
Used by temporal rules to know which times exist for universal propagation.
-/
def knownTimes (b : Branch) : List TimeIndex :=
  (b.map (·.label.time)).eraseDups

/--
Relabel every signed formula sitting at time `src` to sit at time `tgt` instead.

The branch half of temporal identification: the two times are asserted to be the *same*
instant, so everything asserted at one is asserted at the other. `src` disappears from
`knownTimes` (nothing is left carrying it), which is the whole point — a partial order cannot
be made total by adding edges alone if two of its elements are meant to be equal rather than
ordered, so identification has to remove one of them.

Duplicates are erased: a formula already present at `tgt` and also present at `src` would
otherwise appear twice, and the branch is used as a set by `contains`/`knownTimes`.
-/
def identifyTime (b : Branch) (src tgt : TimeIndex) : Branch :=
  (b.map fun sf =>
    if sf.label.time == src then { sf with label := { sf.label with time := tgt } } else sf
  ).eraseDups

/--

Used by existential temporal rules to introduce witness times.
-/

  b.maxTime + 1

/--
Collect all T(GA) formulas in the branch (positive all-future formulas).
These are universal temporal formulas that must be propagated to every known future time.
-/
def allFuturePosFormulas (b : Branch) : List SignedFormula :=
  b.filter fun sf =>
    match sf.sign, sf.formula with
    | .pos, .allFuture _ => true
    | _, _ => false

/--
Collect all F(FA) formulas in the branch (negative some-future formulas).
These are universal temporal formulas that must be propagated to every known future time.
F(FA) = F(¬G¬A) means G¬A holds, so ¬A must hold at every future time.
-/
def someFutureNegFormulas (b : Branch) : List SignedFormula :=
  b.filter fun sf =>
    match sf.sign, sf.formula with
    | .neg, .someFuture _ => true
    | _, _ => false

/--
Collect all T(HA) formulas in the branch (positive all-past formulas).
These are universal temporal formulas that must be propagated to every known past time.
-/
def allPastPosFormulas (b : Branch) : List SignedFormula :=
  b.filter fun sf =>
    match sf.sign, sf.formula with
    | .pos, .allPast _ => true
    | _, _ => false

/--
Collect all F(PA) formulas in the branch (negative some-past formulas).
These are universal temporal formulas that must be propagated to every known past time.
F(PA) = F(¬H¬A) means H¬A holds, so ¬A must hold at every past time.
-/
def somePastNegFormulas (b : Branch) : List SignedFormula :=
  b.filter fun sf =>
    match sf.sign, sf.formula with
    | .neg, .somePast _ => true
    | _, _ => false

/--
Collect all F(U(event, guard)) formulas in the branch (negative Until formulas)
where guard is NOT Formula.top (i.e., not someFuture).
These are persistent formulas that must be propagated to every known future time.
-/
def untlNegFormulas (b : Branch) : List SignedFormula :=
  b.filter fun sf =>
    match sf.sign, sf.formula with
    | .neg, .untl guard _ => guard != Formula.top
    | _, _ => false

/--
Collect all F(S(event, guard)) formulas in the branch (negative Since formulas)
where guard is NOT Formula.top (i.e., not somePast).

    | _, _ => false

/--
Collect all F(FA) formulas at a specific time (across all worlds).
Used by world-creation rules to propagate temporal universals to fresh worlds.

## Eventuality Tracking
-/

/--
An eventuality records a pending obligation from an Until or Since formula.
Until eventualities require the event to be witnessed at some future time;
Since eventualities require the event to be witnessed at some past time.
Blocking logic uses this to detect infinite deferral.
-/
structure Eventuality where
  /-- The Until/Since formula that generated this eventuality. -/
  formula : Formula
  /-- The label (world, time) at which the eventuality was introduced. -/
  label : Label
  /-- true for Until (future-directed), false for Since (past-directed). -/
  isUntil : Bool
  deriving Repr, DecidableEq, BEq

/--
Tracks pending eventualities on a tableau branch.
Provides operations to add new eventualities and mark them as fulfilled.
-/
structure EventualityTracker where
  /-- List of pending eventualities. -/
  pending : List Eventuality
  deriving Repr

namespace EventualityTracker

/-- Empty tracker with no pending eventualities. -/
def empty : EventualityTracker := { pending := [] }

/-- Add a new eventuality to track. -/
def add (tracker : EventualityTracker) (e : Eventuality) : EventualityTracker :=
  { pending := e :: tracker.pending }

/-- Remove a fulfilled eventuality (by formula and label match). -/
def fulfill (tracker : EventualityTracker) (formula : Formula) (label : Label) :
    EventualityTracker :=
  { pending := tracker.pending.filter fun e => !(e.formula == formula && e.label == label) }

/-- Check if there are any pending eventualities. -/
def hasPending (tracker : EventualityTracker) : Bool :=
  !tracker.pending.isEmpty

/-- Get pending eventualities at a specific time index. -/
def pendingAtTime (tracker : EventualityTracker) (t : TimeIndex) : List Eventuality :=
  tracker.pending.filter fun e => e.label.time == t

/-- Check if an eventuality is fulfilled (no longer pending). -/
def isFulfilled (tracker : EventualityTracker) (e : Eventuality) : Bool :=
  !tracker.pending.any (· == e)

end EventualityTracker

/-!
## Subset Blocking for Temporal Tableau Termination

Subset blocking prevents infinite temporal chains in tableau expansion.
When a new time point t' has signed formulas that are a subset of an
ancestor time point t, further expansion from t' is blocked. This is
sound because any model satisfying the formulas at t also satisfies
the (fewer) formulas at t', so the branch cannot yield new information.

The "time type" of a time point is the set of formulas asserted at that
time. Subset blocking checks: type(t') ⊆ type(t_ancestor).
-/

namespace Branch

/--
Collect all signed formulas on a branch at a given time index.
Returns the list of signed formulas whose label has the specified time.
-/
def formulasAtTime (b : Branch) (t : TimeIndex) : List SignedFormula :=
  b.filter fun sf => sf.label.time == t

/--
Extract the "time type" of a time point: the set of (sign, formula) pairs
at that time, deduplicated. This ignores the world component so that
blocking works across worlds (though in practice blocking is per-world).
-/
def timeType (b : Branch) (t : TimeIndex) : List (Sign × Formula) :=
  ((b.formulasAtTime t).map fun sf => (sf.sign, sf.formula)).eraseDups

/--
Check if the time type at `t1` is a subset of the time type at `t2`.
That is, every (sign, formula) pair at `t1` also appears at `t2`.

When `isSubsetBlocked b t_new t_anc = true`, expanding `t_new` further
cannot produce information not already available at `t_anc`.
-/
def isSubsetBlocked (b : Branch) (t_new t_anc : TimeIndex) : Bool :=
  let typeNew := b.timeType t_new
  let typeAnc := b.timeType t_anc
  typeNew.all fun pair => typeAnc.any fun pair' => pair == pair'

end Branch

## Time Ordering Constraints
-/

/--
Time ordering constraints for abstract temporal order tracking.

In temporal tableau rules, fresh time points are introduced by existential rules
(F(GA), T(FA), etc.). These fresh time points have numerically larger indices
but may represent logically earlier or later times. The TimeOrdering structure
tracks the abstract temporal order via explicit constraint pairs.

Each constraint `(a, b)` means `a` is strictly before `b` in the abstract
temporal order (a < b).
-/
structure TimeOrdering : Type where
  /-- List of ordering constraints. Each `(a, b)` means `a < b` in abstract time. -/
  constraints : List (TimeIndex × TimeIndex)
  deriving Repr

namespace TimeOrdering

/-- Empty time ordering with no constraints. -/
def empty : TimeOrdering := { constraints := [] }

/-- Initial ordering: time 0 exists implicitly, no constraints needed. -/
def initWithTime0 : TimeOrdering := empty

/-- Add a future constraint: `t_new` is strictly after `t`. -/
def addFuture (ord : TimeOrdering) (t t_new : TimeIndex) : TimeOrdering :=
  { constraints := (t, t_new) :: ord.constraints }

/-- Add a past constraint: `t_new` is strictly before `t`. -/
def addPast (ord : TimeOrdering) (t t_new : TimeIndex) : TimeOrdering :=
  { constraints := (t_new, t) :: ord.constraints }

/--
Rewrite every constraint mentioning `src` to mention `tgt` instead.

The ordering half of temporal identification, the companion of `Branch.identifyTime`.
`TimeOrdering` is a list of strict `<` pairs and cannot express equality, so identifying two
instants is done by substitution rather than by adding an edge.

Constraints that collapse to `(t, t)` are dropped. They are not merely redundant: `(t, t)`
asserts `t < t`, which `futureOf` would then propagate into a spurious cycle making every
time reachable from every other, and `timeOrderTotal` would report `true` for a branch whose
order is in fact inconsistent. Duplicates are erased for the same reason `Branch.identifyTime`
erases them — the constraint list is read as a set.
-/
def identifyTime (ord : TimeOrdering) (src tgt : TimeIndex) : TimeOrdering :=
  { constraints :=
      (ord.constraints.filterMap fun (a, b) =>
        let a' := if a == src then tgt else a
        let b' := if b == src then tgt else b
        if a' == b' then none else some (a', b')).eraseDups }

/-- Immediate successors of `t`: the `b` of every constraint `(t, b)`.

One step only. Callers that need the temporal order itself want `futureOf`, which is the
transitive closure of this relation; `directFutureOf` is exposed separately because the
closure is computed from it and because a rule that genuinely means "one step" (there are
none today) should say so explicitly. -/
def directFutureOf (ord : TimeOrdering) (t : TimeIndex) : List TimeIndex :=
  ord.constraints.filterMap fun (a, b) =>
    if a == t then some b else none

/-- Immediate predecessors of `t`: the `a` of every constraint `(a, t)`. One step only;
see `directFutureOf`. -/
def directPastOf (ord : TimeOrdering) (t : TimeIndex) : List TimeIndex :=
  ord.constraints.filterMap fun (a, b) =>
    if b == t then some a else none

/--
Breadth-first forward reachability with a visited set.

`frontier` is the current BFS layer, `visited` everything already reached. Each step takes
one hop from the frontier, discards already-visited times, and recurses on what remains.
`fuel` bounds the number of layers.

The visited-set filter is what makes this safe on a cyclic constraint list: a cycle
revisits an already-recorded time, the frontier empties, and the recursion stops early
rather than running the fuel down. It also keeps the cost linear in the number of distinct
times rather than exponential in the fuel, which a naive `flatMap`-and-recurse closure
would be.

/--
All times strictly after `t` in the temporal order: the transitive closure of the forward
constraint edges, fuel-bounded.

**This must not be the direct-edge filter.** The temporal rules that consume it
(`allFuturePos`, `someFutureNeg` and their past mirrors) read it as "the times `G φ @ t`
constrains", which is every time after `t`, not merely the successors recorded by a single
`addFuture` call. With a direct-edge reading, `ord = [(0,1), (1,2)]` propagates `G p @ t0`
to `t1` and stops, so `G p → G G p` — valid over any linear order — produces an open
branch describing a model that does not exist. There is no compensating
`T(Gφ) → T(G(Gφ))` rule to recover the missing reach.

The fuel default matches the constraint-list depth the engine can produce before blocking
fires; `reachableForward` terminates early via its visited set, so the bound is a
safety net rather than the normal exit.

## Subset Blocking (requires TimeOrdering)
-/

/--
The temporal ancestors of `t`: every time strictly before `t` in the transitive closure of
the ordering constraints.

**Predecessor edges only, and never `t` itself.** An earlier version followed
`directPredecessors ++ directSuccessors`, which computes the *connected component* of `t`
rather than its ancestors. That is not a near miss — it makes blocking vacuous. Following
a successor edge and then coming back along it returns `t`, so every time incident to any
constraint is its own "ancestor"; since `isSubsetBlocked b t t` is reflexively true,
`isTemporallyBlocked` then fired for every such time regardless of formula content, and
`expandBranchWithFuel` handed back the branch as a "blocked open branch" immediately.

Any termination or pigeonhole argument stated against the old predicate would have been
measuring that artifact rather than a real repetition of time types.

This is exactly `TimeOrdering.pastOf`, which already performs fuel-bounded backward
reachability with a visited set; the name is kept because the blocking code reads better
in terms of ancestors.
-/
def ancestorTimes (ord : TimeOrdering) (t : TimeIndex) (fuel : Nat := 100) : List TimeIndex :=
  ord.pastOf t fuel

/--
Check if all pending eventualities at time `t_new` are either:
(a) fulfilled in the tracker, or
(b) duplicated at the blocking ancestor `t_anc` (same eventuality formula
    exists pending at `t_anc` too, so the ancestor will handle it).

This is the eventuality-aware guard for subset blocking.
Without this check, blocking can prematurely cut off branches where
Until/Since eventualities at `t_new` have not yet been satisfied.
With this check, blocking only fires when it is safe: all pending
obligations are either already fulfilled or will be handled by the ancestor.

    -- Option (a): the eventuality is no longer pending (fulfilled)
    -- Note: if e is in pendingAtNew, it IS pending, so we check if
    -- the same formula appears fulfilled elsewhere. We use a looser
    -- check: is the formula/world combination no longer pending at
    -- any time except t_new?
    -- Actually simpler: check if the same eventuality (same formula)
    -- also has a pending entry at the ancestor time. If so, the
    -- ancestor will handle it too (duplicated).
    let duplicatedAtAnc := tracker.pending.any fun e' =>
      e'.formula == e.formula && e'.label.time == t_anc && e'.isUntil == e.isUntil
    duplicatedAtAnc

/--
Check if a given time index is temporally blocked by any ancestor time.

A time `t` is blocked if there exists some ancestor time `t_anc` such that:
1. The time type at `t` is a subset of the time type at `t_anc` (subset blocking)
2. All pending eventualities at `t` are fulfilled or duplicated at `t_anc`
   (eventuality-aware blocking)

When both conditions hold, further expansion from time `t` cannot produce
new information that would not also be available at the ancestor.

**Argument order matters in the eventuality guard.**
`allEventualitiesFulfilledOrDuplicated` takes `(tracker) (t_new t_anc)` — the blocked
time first, the ancestor second. Passing them the other way round asks "is every
eventuality pending at the *ancestor* duplicated at the *blocked* time", which is the
converse of the required side condition and lets blocking fire while an unfulfilled
Until/Since obligation at `t` is still outstanding. Here `t` is the candidate blocked
time, so it goes first.
