# Branch Closure Detection for Tableau Decision Procedure

This module implements closure detection for tableau branches. A branch is
closed if it contains a logical contradiction, which can arise from:

1. **Contradiction**: Both T(φ) and F(φ) for some formula φ
2. **Bot positive**: T(⊥) (bottom asserted true)
3. **Axiom negation**: F(axiom instance) where the axiom is valid

## Main Definitions

- `ClosureReason`: Witness type explaining why a branch closed
- `findClosure`: Detect if a branch is closed and produce witness
- `isClosed`: Boolean check for branch closure

## Implementation Notes

The closure detection integrates with the `matchAxiom` function from
ProofSearch.lean to identify negated axiom instances. When F(φ) is in
the branch and φ matches an axiom pattern, the branch closes because
axioms are valid in all models.

## Closure Reason Type
-/

/--
Witness for why a branch is closed.

Each constructor provides evidence of the contradiction:
- `contradiction`: Both T(φ) and F(φ) are present
- `botPos`: T(⊥) is present (asserting falsum is true)
- `axiomNeg`: F(axiom) is present (negating a valid axiom)
-/

  /-- Branch contains both T(φ) and F(φ) at the same label. -/
  | contradiction (φ : Formula) (label : Label)
  /-- Branch contains T(⊥) at some label. -/
  | botPos (label : Label)
  /-- Branch contains F(φ) where φ is an axiom instance, at some label. -/

## Monotonicity Lemmas

These lemmas establish that closure checks are monotonic: if a branch is closed,
extending it with more formulas keeps it closed.

## Closure Properties

Note: These theorems require careful reasoning about how `findSome?` interacts
with branch extension. The proofs are non-trivial because `checkContradiction`
captures the branch in its lambda, creating a dependency between the branch
being searched and the condition being checked.
-/

/--
A closed branch remains closed when extended.
Adding more formulas cannot "undo" a contradiction.

The intuition is clear: if we found a contradiction in `b`, that same
contradiction still exists in `sf :: b`. The technical challenge is that
`checkContradiction` checks `hasNeg b` (not `hasNeg (sf :: b)`), but since
`hasNeg` is monotonic, any witness in `b` remains valid.
