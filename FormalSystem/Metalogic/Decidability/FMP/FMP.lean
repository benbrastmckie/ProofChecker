# Finite Model Property for TM Bimodal Logic

This module proves the Finite Model Property (FMP) for TM bimodal logic.

## Overview

The Finite Model Property states: If a formula is satisfiable, then it is
satisfiable in a finite model whose size is bounded by 2^|closure(φ)|.

Equivalently (contrapositive): If a formula is valid in all finite models,
it is valid in all models.

## Proof Strategy

The proof uses the MCS-based filtration approach:
1. If φ is not valid, then ¬φ is consistent (not a theorem)
2. By restricted Lindenbaum, there exists a closure MCS containing ¬φ
3. The filtered model (quotient by closure equivalence) is finite
4. Truth is preserved under filtration (membership = truth)
5. Therefore φ fails at some world in the finite filtered model

## Main Results

- `fmp_contrapositive`: If φ valid in all finite models → φ valid
- `finite_model_property`: ¬valid(φ) → ∃ finite model falsifying φ
- `assignmentSpace_card`: The assignment space has exactly 2^|closure(φ)| elements
- `filtered_world_bound`: `Nat.card (FilteredWorld φ) ≤ 2^|closure(φ)|`
- `fmp_size_bound`: The FMP countermodel is finite and bounded by 2^|closure(φ)|

## Finite Model Property Statement

The main FMP theorem connects unsatisfiability to finite model falsification.

Bundled finite filtered task frame with its formula.

structure BundledFilteredFrame (D : TemporalOrder) where
  /-- The formula whose subformula closure the filtration was taken with respect to. -/
  phi : Formula
  /-- The finite task frame obtained by filtering through `phi`'s subformula closure. -/
  frame : Semantics.FiniteFrameOver D

/--
The space of truth assignments to the subformula closure has exactly `2 ^ |closure(φ)|` elements.

This is an equality, not a bound: the closure is a `Finset`, so its coercion to a type is a
`Fintype` (`subformulaClosureFintype`), and the powerset of an `n`-element type has `2 ^ n`
elements. It is the *target* of the filtration's characteristic-set map, and so supplies the
figure that `filtered_world_bound` transports to the world type.
-/
theorem assignmentSpace_card (phi : Formula) :
    Nat.card (Set (subformulaClosure phi)) = 2 ^ (subformulaClosure phi).card := by
  rw [Nat.card_eq_fintype_card, Fintype.card_set, Fintype.card_coe]

/--
The number of worlds in the filtered model is at most `2 ^ |closure(φ)|`.

The bound is transported along `filteredCharacteristicSet`, the map sending a filtered world to
the set of closure formulas its representatives satisfy. That map is *injective*
(`filteredCharacteristicSet_injective`) — which is exactly the content of the filtration
equivalence, since two closure MCSs are identified precisely when they agree on the closure — so
the world type has no more elements than the assignment space, whose size
`assignmentSpace_card` computes exactly.

The `Nat.card` here is not the junk value that convention assigns to infinite types:
`FilteredWorld.finite` proves `Finite (FilteredWorld phi)` independently, via the same injection.
The inequality is therefore a real bound on a genuinely finite type, and not vacuously satisfied
by `Nat.card = 0`.

    Nat.card (FilteredWorld phi) ≤ 2 ^ (subformulaClosure phi).card := by

## FMP Main Theorem

We state the FMP in terms of MCS membership, which corresponds to
satisfiability in the canonical model construction.

### What "FMP" means here, and what it does not

Read the two termini below literally. `mcs_finite_model_property` produces a
`ClosureMCSBundle phi` with `phi ∉ S.carrier`, plus `Finite (FilteredWorld phi)`;
`fmp_size_bound` adds `Nat.card (FilteredWorld phi) ≤ 2 ^ (subformulaClosure phi).card`. Both are
**Lindenbaum-plus-cardinality statements about MCS membership**. Neither mentions a model, a
history, or a time — and neither does anything else in this directory: `TruthAt` occurs **zero**
times across all six files under `Decidability/FMP/` (measured by `grep -rc`).

That is a *syntactic* finite model property, and it is what this directory delivers. A **semantic**
finite model property — of the shape "if `φ` is refutable then it is refuted in some model of
bounded size" — is a different theorem needing three things this directory does not have:

1. a world space derived from *a given model*, not from a quotient of `ClosureMCSBundle`
   (i.e. sets of formulas);
2. a **non-permissive** relation — `refinedFilteredTaskRel` is universal at nonzero duration, as
   this directory's `README.md` records, so it identifies too much to support a truth lemma; and
3. a truth lemma, of which there is none here.

Consequence for anyone planning that work: **it is not a refactor of this directory.** The subject
is different. What `FMP/` genuinely supplies to such an effort is its cardinality bookkeeping —
`filtered_world_bound` and `fmp_size_bound` — and not the world space, the relation, or any
transfer of truth.
-/

/--
MCS-based Finite Model Property: If φ is not provable, then there exists
a closure MCS (a world in a finite model) where φ is false (not a member).

This is the key building block for the full FMP theorem.

**Why `FrameClass.Base` is essential here**: this is a theorem *about the base system* and its
statement is deliberately preserved verbatim. The machinery beneath it is now
`fc`-parameterised — `filtered_model_falsifies` is `{fc}`-polymorphic, and `ClosureMCSBundle` /
`FilteredWorld` carry a trailing `(fc : FrameClass := FrameClass.Base)` — so the `Base` reading
here is the default instance of a general construction rather than a hard-coded limit. Read the
general statement off `filtered_model_falsifies` plus `FilteredWorld.finite`.
-/
theorem mcs_finite_model_property (phi : Formula)
    (h_not_provable : ¬Derivable FrameClass.Base [] phi) :
    ∃ (S : ClosureMCSBundle phi), phi ∉ S.carrier ∧
    Finite (FilteredWorld phi) := by
  obtain ⟨S, h_not_in⟩ := filtered_model_falsifies phi h_not_provable
  exact ⟨S, h_not_in, FilteredWorld.finite phi⟩

/--
Contrapositive of FMP: If φ is true in all closure MCS for the finite
filtered model, then φ is provable.

This establishes completeness via finite model reasoning.

**Why `FrameClass.Base` is essential here**: as with `mcs_finite_model_property`, this is a
preserved statement about the base system, resting on the `Base` default of the now
`fc`-parameterised `ClosureMCSBundle`.
-/
theorem fmp_contrapositive (phi : Formula)
    (h_all_mcs : ∀ (S : ClosureMCSBundle phi), phi ∈ S.carrier) :
    Derivable FrameClass.Base [] phi := by
  by_contra h_not_provable
  obtain ⟨S, h_not_in, _⟩ := mcs_finite_model_property phi h_not_provable
  exact h_not_in (h_all_mcs S)

/-!
## FMP Size Bound

The finite model has size bounded by 2^|closure(φ)|.
-/

/--
The Finite Model Property with its size bound attached: if `φ` is not provable, the countermodel
the FMP produces lives in a world type that is finite and has at most `2 ^ |closure(φ)|` elements.

This is `mcs_finite_model_property` with `filtered_world_bound` carried alongside, which is what
makes it a *size* bound rather than a bare finiteness claim — the point of the FMP for
decidability is not that some finite countermodel exists but that its size is bounded by a
computable function of `φ`, so that only finitely many candidates need be searched.

Each world (an equivalence class of closure MCSs) is determined by which closure formulas it
satisfies, and there are `2 ^ |closure|` such assignments; `filtered_world_bound` is where that
argument is discharged, through the injectivity of `filteredCharacteristicSet`.

**Why `FrameClass.Base` is essential here**: it inherits the frame class of
`mcs_finite_model_property`, whose statement it carries the size bound alongside; like that
theorem it is a preserved result about the base system.
-/
theorem fmp_size_bound (phi : Formula)
    (h_not_provable : ¬Derivable FrameClass.Base [] phi) :
    ∃ (S : ClosureMCSBundle phi), phi ∉ S.carrier ∧
    Finite (FilteredWorld phi) ∧
    Nat.card (FilteredWorld phi) ≤ 2 ^ (subformulaClosure phi).card := by
  obtain ⟨S, h_not_in, h_fin⟩ := mcs_finite_model_property phi h_not_provable
  exact ⟨S, h_not_in, h_fin, filtered_world_bound phi⟩

## Summary

This module proves the Finite Model Property for TM bimodal logic:

1. **exists_mcs_with_negation**: If φ not provable, ∃ closure MCS with ¬φ
2. **filtered_model_falsifies**: If φ not provable, ∃ world where φ fails
3. **mcs_finite_model_property**: Combined with finiteness proof
4. **fmp_contrapositive**: If φ true in all finite worlds → φ provable
5. **assignmentSpace_card**: The assignment space has exactly 2^|closure(φ)| elements
6. **filtered_world_bound**: The world type has at most 2^|closure(φ)| elements
7. **fmp_size_bound**: The FMP countermodel is finite and carries that bound

These results establish that TM bimodal logic has the finite model property,
which is essential for decidability.

Items 5-7 replace two theorems that previously stood at 5 and 6 under the names
`filtered_world_bound` and `fmp_size_bound` and were **vacuous**: each concluded in a `∧ True`
(respectively `∀ _S, True`) conjunct discharged by `trivial`, so neither said anything about
`FilteredWorld` at all. `filtered_world_bound` asserted only that `2 ^ |closure(φ)| ≤
2 ^ |closure(φ)|`, and `fmp_size_bound` only that some natural number equals
`2 ^ |closure(φ)|` — both true of any formula and of any world type whatsoever. The bound is now
carried by the injectivity of `filteredCharacteristicSet`, which was already proved in
`FiniteModel.lean` and used there for finiteness; it needed only to be read for cardinality as
well.
