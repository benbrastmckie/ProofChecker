# Finiteness Theorem for Filtered Models

This module proves that the filtered model has bounded cardinality.

## Overview

The key insight is that equivalence classes of closure MCS are determined
by their membership on the subformula closure. Since the closure is finite,
there are at most 2^|closure| distinct equivalence classes.

## Main Results

- `FilteredWorld.finite`: The filtered world type is finite
- `FiniteFilteredFrame`: The filtered task frame is finite

## Proof Strategy

1. Each equivalence class is determined by a subset of the closure
2. There are at most 2^|closure| subsets
3. We use the injection principle to prove finiteness

## Characteristic Sets

Each closure MCS is determined by which closure formulas it contains.
We represent this as a subset (Set) of the closure.

Lift characteristic set to filtered worlds.

**The codomain is `Set`, not `Finset`, and this matters.** A recurring misreading of this map —
and of `filteredCharacteristicSet_injective` below — takes it to embed `FilteredWorld phi` into
`Finset (subformulaClosure phi)`, and concludes that the filtration's world-space is "already
data-shaped" and so a ready-made starting point for a *computable* presentation of a model. It is
not. This map lands in `Set (subformulaClosure phi)`; the finiteness that makes that codomain
useful is supplied by `set_finite` below, which is `noncomputable`, as is `FilteredWorld.finite`
itself. The whole space is `Prop`-shaped, exactly like every other `Finite`.

So nothing here can be enumerated, indexed, or fed to a decision procedure without first being
rebuilt as data. Anything wanting a `Fin n`-indexed carrier — `Decidability/IntPresentation.lean`'s
`IntPresentation`, for instance — must construct its world-space from `Finset`/`Bool` data
directly rather than extract it from this one.

## Main Finiteness Theorem

The filtered world type is finite.

The subformula closure is a Finset, which gives us a Fintype instance.

    Fintype (subformulaClosure phi) :=
  (subformulaClosure phi).fintypeCoeSort

/--
The subformula closure elements form a finite type, so its powerset is also finite.
This uses `Set.instFinite` from Mathlib.Data.Fintype.Powerset.

/--
FilteredWorld is finite because it injects into a finite type.

noncomputable instance FilteredWorld.finite (phi : Formula) :
    Finite (FilteredWorld phi) := by
  -- FilteredWorld phi injects into Set (subformulaClosure phi)

## Finite Filtered Task Frame

The finite filtered task frame.

This bundles the refined filtered task frame with the proof
that its world states are finite.

  toFrameOver := RefinedFilteredTaskFrame D phi

The finite filtered frame has the same world state type as the refined frame.

/-! ### `FiniteFilteredTaskFrame` inherits the four axioms

`FiniteFrameOver` *extends* `FrameOver` (`TaskFrame.lean`), so every field the frame structure
grows propagates to this construction. Its `toTaskFrame` is `RefinedFilteredTaskFrame D phi`
definitionally, so each axiom fact is that frame's, unchanged — including the
`[SuccOrder ↑D] [NoMaxOrder ↑D]` restriction *Limit* forces, which this frame inherits rather than
imposes. It is the only live `FiniteFrameOver` construction in the library. -/

theorem FiniteFilteredTaskFrame_limit [SuccOrder ↑D] [NoMaxOrder ↑D] (phi : Formula) :

      (∀ x, 0 < x → ∃ y, |y| < x ∧ (FiniteFilteredTaskFrame D phi).TaskRel w y u) → u = w :=

## Summary

This module proves:
1. FilteredWorld phi is finite
2. FiniteFilteredTaskFrame bundles the frame with finiteness

The key technique is showing that equivalence classes are determined
by characteristic sets, and these sets form a finite type
(the powerset of a finite set is finite).
