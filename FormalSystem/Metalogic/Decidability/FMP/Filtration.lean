# Filtration Construction for FMP

This module defines the filtration equivalence and quotient model construction
for the Finite Model Property (FMP).

## Overview

Filtration is a technique to construct finite models from infinite ones:
1. Define equivalence: w ≡_φ v iff they agree on truth of all closure formulas
2. Take quotient of world states by this equivalence
3. Define filtered accessibility as lifting of original accessibility
4. Show the filtered model is finite (bounded by 2^|closure φ|)

## Main Definitions

- `MCSFiltrationEquiv`: Equivalence relation based on membership agreement on closure
- `ClosureMCSSetoid`: The setoid structure for quotient construction
- `FilteredWorld`: Quotient type of closure MCS under filtration equivalence
- `FilteredTaskFrame`: Task frame on filtered worlds

## Approach

For TM bimodal logic, we use an MCS-based filtration approach:
- "Worlds" are closure MCS (restricted to subformula closure)
- Equivalence is agreement on which closure formulas are in the MCS
- This directly relates to canonical model construction

### Nonemptiness of the filtered world type

`FilteredWorld phi` is inhabited for **every** `phi`, with no consistency side condition on
`phi` itself: the witness comes from Lindenbaum-extending the *empty* set within the closure,
which needs only that the logic itself is consistent. `Finite (FilteredWorld phi)`
(`FiniteModel.lean`) is a genuinely different fact and does not imply this one.
-/

/--
The empty set of formulas is consistent at any frame class whose system is consistent.

The only list all of whose members lie in `∅` is `[]`, so the obligation collapses to
`¬ Derivable fc [] ⊥` — the consistency of the system at `fc`, which is exactly the hypothesis.

Consistency of the system is genuinely a per-frame-class fact and cannot be discharged
uniformly in `fc`: it is read off a soundness theorem for `fc`, and the tree currently proves
one for `FrameClass.Base` (`not_derivable_nil_bot`) and for `FrameClass.ZTime`
(`not_derivable_nil_bot_ztime`). Hence the hypothesis rather than a `{fc}`-uniform statement.
-/
theorem setConsistent_empty_of {fc : FrameClass}
    (h : ¬ Derivable fc ([] : Context) Formula.bot) :
    SetConsistent (fc := fc) (∅ : Set Formula) := by
  intro L hL
  have hnil : L = [] := by
    cases L with
    | nil => rfl
    | cons a _ => exact absurd (hL a (by simp)) (by simp)
  subst hnil
  exact h

/--
The empty set of formulas is consistent at `FrameClass.Base`.

**Why `Base` is essential here**: this is the `fc := FrameClass.Base` instance of
`setConsistent_empty_of`, and the consistency witness it consumes
(`Metalogic/Soundness.lean`'s `not_derivable_nil_bot`) is a theorem about the base system
specifically. The `{fc}`-uniform statement is `setConsistent_empty_of`.
-/
theorem setConsistent_empty :
    SetConsistent (fc := ProofSystem.FrameClass.Base) (∅ : Set Formula) :=
  setConsistent_empty_of FormalSystem.Metalogic.not_derivable_nil_bot

/--
Every formula has at least one closure MCS: Lindenbaum-extend `∅` within `closureWithNeg phi`.

The extension lemma is `closure_mcs_extension` (`ClosureMCS.lean`), whose two hypotheses are
`ClosureRestricted phi ∅` (immediate) and `SetConsistent ∅` (`setConsistent_empty` above).
-/
theorem closureMCSBundle_nonempty_of {fc : FrameClass}
    (h : ¬ Derivable fc ([] : Context) Formula.bot) (phi : Formula) :
    Nonempty (ClosureMCSBundle phi fc) := by
  obtain ⟨M, _, hM⟩ :=
    closure_mcs_extension phi ∅ (Set.empty_subset _) (setConsistent_empty_of h)
  exact ⟨⟨M, hM⟩⟩

/--
Every formula has at least one `FrameClass.Base` closure MCS.

**Why `Base` is essential here**: this is the `fc := FrameClass.Base` instance of
`closureMCSBundle_nonempty_of`; it inherits the base-system consistency witness from
`setConsistent_empty`. The `{fc}`-uniform statement is `closureMCSBundle_nonempty_of`, which
also applies at `FrameClass.ZTime` via `not_derivable_nil_bot_ztime`.
-/
theorem closureMCSBundle_nonempty (phi : Formula) : Nonempty (ClosureMCSBundle phi) :=
  closureMCSBundle_nonempty_of FormalSystem.Metalogic.not_derivable_nil_bot phi

/--
The filtered world type is nonempty: push `closureMCSBundle_nonempty` through the quotient map.

This is what lets the filtration frames satisfy a world-state nonemptiness requirement without
assuming anything about `phi`.

**Why `Base` is essential here**: an `instance` cannot carry the per-frame-class consistency
hypothesis that `closureMCSBundle_nonempty_of` needs, so the instance is registered at the one
frame class whose consistency is available unconditionally at this point in the import graph.
At another `fc`, apply `(closureMCSBundle_nonempty_of h phi).map (toFilteredWorld phi)` directly.
-/
instance filteredWorld_nonempty (phi : Formula) : Nonempty (FilteredWorld phi) :=
  (closureMCSBundle_nonempty phi).map (toFilteredWorld phi)

## Filtered Task Frame

We construct a task frame on the filtered worlds.

For the FMP construction, we use the "largest filtration" where
the task relation is universal. This ensures:
1. The frame axioms hold trivially
2. Truth preservation for box/diamond follows from MCS properties
3. The model is finite (as required)

A more refined "smallest filtration" could be used for preserving
additional frame properties (reflexivity, transitivity, etc.).

    (w : FilteredWorld phi) (d : D) (u : FilteredWorld phi) : Prop :=
  if d = 0 then w = u else True

/--
The refined filtered task frame with proper nullity_identity.

**Discrete duration types only.** `[SuccOrder ↑D] [NoMaxOrder ↑D]` is a genuine restriction, not
bookkeeping: the relation is universal above duration zero, so over a *dense* `D` every filtered
world sits in every cone of every other one (for any radius `x > 0` pick `y ≠ 0` with `|y| < x`)
and the paper's *Limit* axiom (`def:frame#Limit`, verbatim:
"$\bigcap\limits_{x > 0} (w)_x = \set{w}$") collapses outright. Over a discrete `D` the axiom is
restored, because `|y| < Order.succ 0` forces `y = 0` — this is exactly what
`TaskFrame.limit_of_succOrder` proves. `TaskFrame.exists_uniform_radius_of_finite` records the
same fact from the other side: a *finite* frame satisfying *Limit* over a dense duration type is
temporally rigid, so the filtration and FMP frames cannot both be finite and dense-polymorphic.
The restriction is therefore forced by the axiom rather than adopted for convenience.

Every consumer of this frame — `FiniteFilteredTaskFrame`, `FiniteFilteredTaskFrame.worldState_eq`,
and `filteredFiniteFrame` — is itself polymorphic in `D` and carries the same two instances; none
elaborates at a dense duration type, and nothing outside `FMP/` refers to any of them.

/-! ### `RefinedFilteredTaskFrame` discharges `def:frame`'s four axioms

`refinedFilteredTaskRel` — `if d = 0 then w = u else True` — is the *permissive* relation class
of `TaskFrame.lean`'s Helper B, spelled with an `if` rather than a disjunction. Once that is
recorded (`RefinedFilteredTaskFrame_rel_iff`), all four axioms follow from the reusable helpers:
*Seriality*, interpolation, and *Saturation* unconditionally, and *Limit* from this frame's
`[SuccOrder ↑D] [NoMaxOrder ↑D]` restriction. -/

/-- The refined filtered relation is the permissive class: the `if`-form
`if d = 0 then w = u else True` and the disjunctive form `d ≠ 0 ∨ w = u` are the same
proposition. -/
theorem RefinedFilteredTaskFrame_rel_iff [SuccOrder ↑D] [NoMaxOrder ↑D] (phi : Formula) :

refined filtered frame, in the literal transcribed shape. This is the axiom the frame's

for why the restriction is not removable. -/

/-- *Saturation* (`def:frame#Saturation`, verbatim: "$\bigcap \mathcal{S} \neq \emptyset$ for any
$\supseteq$-directed family $\mathcal{S}$ of nonempty fibers and segments") for the refined
filtered frame: every nonempty fiber and segment is the whole carrier (above duration zero) or a
singleton (at zero), and a directed family cannot contain two distinct singletons. Unlike
*Limit*, this needs no restriction on `D`. -/
