# Cancellable (Abort-Aware) Tableau Expansion

This module provides **runtime-only** `IO` mirrors of the pure tableau core
(`expandBranchWithFuel` → `saturateBlocked` → `buildTableau` → `decide` →
`decideAutoAdaptive`). Each mirror checks an `IO.Ref Bool` abort flag (plus
`IO.checkCanceled` as belt-and-braces) at every recursive step and maps an
observed abort to `none`, which upstream maps to `.fuelExhausted` — an aborted run
can never yield `.valid`/`.invalid`.

## Why a parallel implementation?

Threading an `IO.Ref Bool` through the pure `expandBranchWithFuel` would force
it into `IO` and break the four proof-bearing theorems that `unfold`/`simp`
the pure definition (`expandBranchWithFuel_sound`, the two `tryBranch`
helpers, `invalid_of_expandBranchWithFuel_open`). Instead we follow the
established `_tracedImpl` precedent (Saturation.lean): mirror the
pure recursion shape in a monad — here `IO` instead of `StateM` — leaving the
pure functions and all their proofs byte-for-byte untouched.

## Drift risk

Each mirror is a **line-for-line transcription** of the corresponding pure
function; the only additions are the leading abort check and the `for`-loop
rendering of the split `foldl` (identical to `_tracedImpl`). Keep the two
definitions in sync: any change to a pure function
(`expandBranchWithFuel`/`saturateBlocked`/`buildTableau`) must be mirrored
here. A `#eval` spot-check (Phase 5) compares the mirror (abort never set)
against the pure function on sample formulas.

## No new proof obligations

The mirrors feed only dataset labels / JSON output. The convention that abort
maps to `none` (and thence to `.fuelExhausted`) keeps labels conservative by
construction, so no soundness theorems are required. Each mirror closes
termination with the identical `termination_by fuel` / `decreasing_by
all_goals simp_wf` already discharged for `_tracedImpl`.

Cancellable `IO` mirror of `saturateBlocked` (Saturation.lean:495).

Continues expanding a blocked branch, rejecting steps that introduce new
time constraints, until saturated or closed. Returns `none` only on abort
(the pure function never returns `none`; upstream maps `none` to `.fuelExhausted`).

**Mirror of** `saturateBlocked`; keep the two in sync.

Cancellable `IO` mirror of `resolveOpenArm`.

Settles a sub-branch that came back open before the enclosing split loop decides whether to
keep exploring its siblings: `some (.inl _)` = the arm closes under post-blocking saturation,
`some (.inr _)` = the arm is open *and* saturated, `none` = undecided (or aborted). As in the
pure function, an arm that cannot be settled is never counted as closed.

## Cancellable Decision Wrappers

These wrap the cancellable tableau core into decision-level entry points that
reuse the pure fast paths (`tryAxiomProof`, `buildCompositionalProof`,
`boundedSearchWithProof` — cheap and bounded) and map an observed abort
(surfacing as a `none` tableau) to `.fuelExhausted`, never `.valid`/`.invalid`.
