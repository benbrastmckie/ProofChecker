# Decision Procedure for TM Bimodal Logic

This module provides the main decision procedure for TM bimodal logic validity.
The procedure decides whether a formula is valid, returning either:
- A proof term (`DerivationTree`) if valid
- A countermodel description if invalid

## Main Definitions

- `DecisionResult`: Sum type of proof or countermodel
- `decide`: Main decision function
- `isValid`, `isSatisfiable`: Boolean convenience functions

## Algorithm Overview

1. **Optimization**: First try direct proof search for shallow proofs
2. **Tableau**: Build tableau for F(φ) (asserting φ is false)
3. **Analysis**:
   - All branches close → φ is valid, extract proof
   - Open saturated branch → φ is invalid, extract countermodel

## Complexity

- Time: O(2^n) where n = formula complexity (PSPACE-complete)
- Space: O(n) for DFS-based tableau expansion
- Typical formulas: Much faster due to pruning and optimization

## Decision Result Type
-/

/--
Result of the decision procedure for a formula.

- `valid`: Formula is valid, with a proof term
- `invalid`: Formula is invalid, with a countermodel description
- `fuelExhausted`: Tableau construction ran out of fuel — validity genuinely undetermined
- `extractionFailed`: Tableau closed (so the formula *is* valid) but no proof term
  could be reconstructed

**Why `timeout` was split (R7).** The former single `timeout` constructor conflated two
situations that are not epistemically alike. `buildTableau` returning `none` leaves validity
open: nothing was decided. `buildTableau` returning `.allClosed` while `extractProof` returns
`.incomplete` is *not* undecided — every branch of the tableau closed, which is exactly the
tableau-level witness of validity; only the *proof-term reconstruction* failed. Reporting the
second as a timeout made the procedure claim ignorance about formulas it had in fact refuted
the negation of, and it made `decide_result_exclusive` unable to state that a closed tableau
is never reported undecided. The two are now distinct constructors, and `isUndecided` holds
of `fuelExhausted` only.

Check if the result leaves validity genuinely undetermined.

Only `fuelExhausted` qualifies: `extractionFailed` means the tableau closed, so the formula
is valid even though no proof term was reconstructed. This is the honest-reporting half of
R7 — a closed tableau is never reported as undecided.

Check if the run established validity, whether or not a proof term was recovered.

True for `valid` (term in hand) and `extractionFailed` (closed tableau, no term).

## Main Decision Procedure
-/

/--
Decide validity of a TM bimodal logic formula.

**Algorithm**:
1. Try direct axiom proof (fast path for axiom instances)
2. Try proof search with limited depth (fast for shallow proofs)
3. Build tableau starting with F(φ)
4. If all branches close: valid, try to extract proof
5. If open branch found: invalid, extract countermodel

**Parameters**:
- `φ`: Formula to decide
- `searchDepth`: Maximum depth for initial proof search (default 10)
- `tableauFuel`: Maximum steps for tableau expansion (default 1000)

**Returns**:
- `valid proof`: Formula is valid with proof term
- `invalid counter`: Formula is invalid with countermodel
- `fuelExhausted`: Tableau fuel ran out before any verdict
- `extractionFailed`: Tableau closed (formula valid) but no proof term recovered

## Blocking-Aware Decision Entry

`decide` above consumes `buildTableau`, whose open certificate carries the *literal* saturation
test `findUnexpanded … = none`. On a blocking engine that test is unreachable for exactly the
formulas whose refutation needs blocking: work remains outstanding at times a saturated ancestor
blocks, so `buildTableau` returns `none` and `decide` reports `.fuelExhausted` for a formula it
has in fact refuted.

`decideBlocking` is the complement. It consumes `buildTableauAt`, whose `hasOpen` carries the
engine's *real* saturation test relative to a named blocked set, so those formulas can be
reported `.invalid` on the certificate the engine can actually produce.

**It is a complement, not a substitute.** `decide` is untouched, still calls `buildTableau`, and
nothing routes through this entry that did not ask for it. And it does not by itself rescue a
formula whose branch never reaches blocking-aware saturation either — that is what
`trivialEventWitnessed` in `Tableau.lean` is for; without that guard `expandBranchWithFuel`
returns `none` and `buildTableauAt` returns `none` here just as `buildTableau` does above.

**No free path to the strong certificate.** The closed arm reaches `ExpandedTableau` only through
`BudgetedTableau.upgrade`; the open arm never reaches `ExpandedTableau` at all. In particular no
`ExpandedTableau.hasOpen` is constructed here, so `upgrade_hasOpen_isSome_iff` remains the only
route from `BudgetedTableau.hasOpen` to `ExpandedTableau.hasOpen`.
-/

/--
Extract a simple countermodel from an open **blocking-aware** saturated branch.

The blocking-aware analogue of `extractCountermodelSimple`: identical extraction, keyed on the
certificate `BudgetedTableau.hasOpen` actually carries
(`findUnexpandedUnblockedWith … (blockedTimes … tracker) = none`) rather than on the literal
`findUnexpanded … = none`. Stating the witness rather than dropping it is what keeps the two
extraction entries distinguishable at their call sites: a reader can see from the signature which
saturation notion the branch was certified against.

This is deliberately *not* routed through `extractCountermodelSimple`, because doing so would
require manufacturing the literal saturation proof this branch does not have.
-/
def extractCountermodelBlocked (φ : Formula) (b : Branch)
    {ord : TimeOrdering} {fc : FrameClass} {tracker : EventualityTracker}
    (_hSaturated : findUnexpandedUnblockedWith b ord fc
      (blockedTimes b ord fc tracker) = none)
    : SimpleCountermodel :=
  extractSimpleCountermodel φ b

/--
Decide validity of a TM bimodal logic formula through the blocking-aware tableau entry.

Arm for arm this is `decide`, with exactly two differences, both forced:

1. The tableau call is `buildTableauAt φ_n tableauFuel fc maxBranches` rather than
   `buildTableau φ_n tableauFuel fc`, so the branch budget is named rather than left at the
   engine default, and the open certificate is blocking-aware.
2. The open arm extracts through `extractCountermodelBlocked`, which consumes the blocking-aware
   witness the certificate carries.

The fast paths (axiom instance, compositional proof, bounded search) are unchanged and are
reached in the same order, so a formula either entry settles early is settled identically by
both.

**Parameters**: as `decide`, plus `maxBranches` (default `50000`, the engine's own default in
`expandBranchWithFuel`), so that `decideBlocking φ` at default arguments and `decide φ` at
default arguments run at the same budget and differ only in the certificate they demand.

**Returns**: as `decide`. `.fuelExhausted` here means fuel or branch budget ran out before
*blocking-aware* saturation, which is a strictly weaker demand than the one `decide` reports
`.fuelExhausted` against.

/--
Decide with automatic fuel, using `soundFuel` (from subformula closure cardinality) instead of the
ad-hoc `recommendedFuel` heuristic.

**What termination means here.** `decideAuto` terminates on every input because it is a total
function called at a finite fuel figure: every path through `decide` returns a `DecisionResult`,
and `.fuelExhausted` is one of the four constructors it may return. No theorem rules
`.fuelExhausted` out, and this docstring does not claim one does.

**What is actually bounded, and under which hypotheses.** The expansion `decideAuto` drives is
proved total only under stated hypotheses:
`expandBranchWithFuel_isSome_of_stock` (`Verified/Termination/Fuel.lean`) gives
`(expandBranchWithFuel …).isSome` from three hypothesis families together — no splitting
(`NoSplit P fc`), a confined formula stock `C` and label set `L`, fuel exceeding
`2 * C.card * L.card`, and a branch budget accommodating that fuel
(`branchesUsed + fuel ≤ maxBranches`). It is derived from
`expandBranchWithFuel_isSome_of_noSplit`, which takes the same shape against an arbitrary finite
signed universe. None of these hypotheses is discharged by `decideAuto` itself.

**Where `soundFuel` sits relative to the justified figure.** `soundFuel φ` is
`min (n * 2 ^ n) 100000` — a *capped* runtime default. `soundFuel_le_soundFuel'`
(`Verified/Termination/Fuel.lean`) proves it is dominated by the uncapped `soundFuel' φ`, and
`soundFuel'` is itself justified only in the single-world dimension: `chain_le_soundFuel'` reaches
it under a hypothesis `hL` confining the label count to the T2 *time* figure, which its own
docstring records as not dischargeable once any `boxNeg` or `diamondPos` fires. The figure that
takes the world dimension as a dimension is `chain_le_worlds_bounded` / `worldFuel'`.

**Subset blocking is a measured behaviour, not a universal guarantee.** `Fuel.lean` evaluates
`buildTableau ((G p) → □(G p)) n .Base` across `n ∈ [0, 40]` and beyond: `none` for every
`n ≤ 24`, and `hasOpen` with a stationary 40-formula certified open branch for every `n ≥ 25` —
a measured ceiling roughly 82× below `soundFuel φ` at that formula. That is an empirical witness
for one `φ`, and is recorded as such rather than quantified over all formulas.

/--
Single-tier fuel strategy with fuel=500. Returns the result and a tag
indicating the fuel tier used (for logging and dataset labeling).

Analysis across c3-c8 confirmed a strictly bimodal decision
landscape: formulas either resolve at fuel=500 or not at all. Zero
formulas across all complexity levels resolved at the former tiers of
2000 or 10000, making the multi-tier escalation dead code. The remaining
timeouts are structural patterns handled by a pre-filter in `labelFormula`.

Returns `(result, fuelTierUsed)` where fuelTierUsed is:
- `"adaptive_500"` for decided formulas
- `"adaptive_timeout"` if fuel exhausted
- `"adaptive_extraction_failed"` if the tableau closed but no proof term was recovered

## Trace-Instrumented Decision Procedure

The functions below mirror `decide` and `decideAuto` but additionally
return a `TraceResult` carrying a full `ProofCertificate` with all rule
firings, branch closures, blocking events, and fuel-exhaustion events
recorded during the tableau expansion.

The original `decide` and `decideAuto` are preserved unchanged. The
traced versions call `expandBranchWithFuelTraced` (a `StateM` wrapper
around `expandBranchWithFuel`) to gather the trace, then post-process
the certificate to fill in `outcome`, `branchingFactor`, and `maxDepth`.
-/

/--
Compute the average branching factor over all `branchCreated` events
in a trace.

Returns `1.0` if there are no `branchCreated` events (degenerate case
where no branching occurred).
-/
def computeBranchingFactor (trace : List TraceEntry) : Float :=
  let branchEvents := trace.filter fun e =>
    match e with
    | .branchCreated _ _ _ _ => true
    | _ => false
  if branchEvents.isEmpty then
    1.0
  else
    -- Each branchCreated event represents one new branch, so the
    -- average branching factor is the total number of new branches
    -- divided by the number of split operations. Since we don't track
    -- splits separately, we just count the events.
    Float.ofNat branchEvents.length

/--
Finalize a `ProofCertificate` by:
- Reversing the trace (events are stored prepended; chronological order
  has oldest first).
- Setting the outcome based on the result.
- Computing `branchingFactor` from the trace.
- Pre-computing `maxDepth` (already maintained incrementally).
-/
def finalizeCertificate (cert : ProofCertificate)
    (outcome : CertOutcome) (trace : List TraceEntry)
    : ProofCertificate :=
  { cert with
    trace := trace.reverse
    outcome := outcome
    branchingFactor := computeBranchingFactor trace }

/--
Run the trace-instrumented decision procedure on a formula.

Returns a `TraceResult`:
- `.success cert` — the decision completed and a full certificate is returned.
- `.failure (.outOfFuel trace steps)` — fuel was exhausted; the partial
  trace is returned for post-mortem analysis.

**Parameters**:
- `φ`: Formula to decide.
- `fuel`: Maximum number of tableau expansion steps.

**Returns**: A `TraceResult` with the full `ProofCertificate`.
