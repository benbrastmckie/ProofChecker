# Good Cycles, with an Explicit Length Bound

`BiLasso/Realized.lean` supplies a finite graph of pigeonhole data and the lemma that a walk of
coherent edges is locally coherent. What it does not supply is **fulfilment**: local coherence is
satisfied by the greatest fixpoint, in which an `untl` is passed forward forever and its event
never delivered. This module extracts cycles that *do* deliver, and — this is the point of the
whole file — bounds their length by a closed arithmetic expression in `P.card` and
`subformulaClosureCard φ`.

## Why an explicit bound is mandatory rather than nice

`check` calls `boundedAnnots P φ bx n` at a **computed** `n`. A merely existential `∃ n` supplies
no such `n`, so the decision procedure could not be written at all; a `Decidable` instance would
then be available only through `Classical.dec`, which would make `check` non-computing. So the
degeneralisation below is forced, not preferred.

## The degeneralisation, done as marks on a walk

A Büchi degeneralisation ordinarily enriches the state space with a `pending` counter. That route
was tried in the previous round and produced existence without a bound. This module keeps the
landed `(state, type)` datum unchanged and puts the degeneralisation in the *walk*:

- Every `untl g e` carried by the base datum `x` gets one **mark** — a position on the cycle where
  its event `e` is realised.
- Marks are supplied by the history itself: `typeAt_fulfillingSeq` (`SmallModel.lean`) says a
  genuine history discharges its own eventualities.
- The stretches *between* marks are shortened independently by
  `exists_lt_iter_of_card_le` (`FMP/Periodicity.lean`), each down to fewer than
  `Nat.card (PigeonState P φ)` steps. Shortening excises a loop between two positions carrying the
  *same* datum, so it moves no mark: the marks sit at segment endpoints, and endpoints are what
  the shortening preserves.

Only the untl-formulas of the **base** type need marking, and that is what `untl_propagates_to_end`
delivers: an `untl` carried at an interior position of a cycle either delivers its event before the
cycle ends, or is still carried at the cycle's endpoint — whose type is the base type. So the mark
count is capped at `subformulaClosureCard φ` *before* any loop is chosen. The same lemma supplies
`FulfillingSeq`'s interval guard for free: each undischarged step forces the guard at the next
position.

## The derived bound, and how it differs from the plan's estimate

The plan's Scope Hypothesis estimated `(k + 1) · N` with `k = subformulaClosureCard φ` and
`N = Nat.card (PigeonState P φ)`, on the assumption that the `m` marks could be laid out along a
single traversal in increasing time order, giving `m + 1` segments.

**The derived bound is `(2k + 1) · N`, and the plan's contingency for exactly this case is
followed: the consumer is kept in sync rather than the derivation bent to the estimate.** Laying
the marks out in a single increasing traversal requires *sorting* the `m` witness times, which the
construction avoids: each mark is obtained independently from the base datum and reached by an
out-and-back excursion `x ⟶ mark ⟶ x`, contributing **two** shortened segments rather than one.
Hence `2m` segments for the marks plus one base cycle, and `m ≤ k`. Nothing is lost — the bound is
a bound, and `Extraction.lean`'s `bound` reads this quantity off `cycleBound` rather than
restating it.

## Main Definitions

- `SeqStep` — the edge relation induced by an arbitrary datum sequence; `RealizedStep` is this at
  the history's own datum sequence, definitionally
- `untlEvent` / `snceEvent` — the event of an eventuality formula, as a partial function
- `cycleBound` — the closed arithmetic bound `(2k + 1) · P.card · 2^k`

## Main Results

- `untl_propagates_to_end` / `snce_propagates_to_start` — the interior-eventuality reduction
- `exists_recurring_datum` — some datum recurs at arbitrarily large (and arbitrarily small) times
- `exists_good_fwd_cycle` / `exists_good_bwd_cycle` — the two bounded good cycles
- `fulfilling_of_good_cycles` — two good cycles plus periodicity give `FulfillingSeq`

Argument order is **guard first** throughout: `Formula.untl g e` and `Formula.snce g e` have guard
`g` and event `e`.

/-! ## The interior-eventuality reduction -/

/--
**An undischarged `untl` survives to the end of the stretch, guard intact.**

If `Formula.untl g e` is carried at `t` and its event `e` appears nowhere in `(t, T]`, then the
obligation is still carried at `T` and the guard `g` holds at every position of `(t, T]`.

Two consequences, both used below:

1. **The mark count is capped before any loop is chosen.** An `untl` carried at an interior
   position of a cycle either delivers inside the cycle or is still carried at the cycle's
   endpoint, whose type is the base type. So only the untl-formulas of the *base* type need
   marking — at most `subformulaClosureCard φ` of them.
2. **`FulfillingSeq`'s interval guard is free.** Taking `T` to be one less than the *least*
   delivery position turns this lemma's guard conclusion into exactly the interval condition
   `FulfillingSeq` demands.

The proof is rightward ℤ-induction (`Int.rightInduction`, `BiLasso/Unfold.lean`) on the `untl`
clause of `LocalCoherentSeq`, which is a biconditional and therefore usable in this direction.

**The leftward mirror**: an undischarged `snce` survives back to the start of the stretch.

Same statement with the two temporal directions exchanged, proved by leftward ℤ-induction
(`Int.leftInduction`) on the `snce` clause. Stated as its own theorem rather than derived by a
duality, because the tree has no `Formula` duality operation and inventing one for this single use
would be more machinery than the twelve lines it saves.

`RealizedStep P φ τ hτ` is `SeqStep (datum P φ τ hτ)` **definitionally** (`realizedStep_eq` below),

excision of the entire loop — and a zero-length cycle discharges nothing and cannot serve as a
bi-lasso segment, since `BiLasso.back_ne` and `BiLasso.fwd_ne` forbid empty cycles.

**The good-cycle construction, at an arbitrary datum sequence.**

Given a datum `x` that recurs at arbitrarily large indices, and a sequence that discharges its own
eventualities, this produces a cycle through `x` of length between `1` and `cycleBound P φ` whose
positions realise the event of every eventuality carried by `x`.

The construction is an induction over the *type* of `x` as a `Finset`, starting from
`exists_base_cycle` and appending, for each formula with an event, an out-and-back excursion
`x ⟶ mark ⟶ x` whose two legs are separately shortened. Two facts make it work:

- **The excursion is available**: the sequence's own fulfilment supplies a later index carrying the
  event, and recurrence supplies a still later index carrying `x` again.
- **Shortening cannot destroy a mark**: the mark sits at the junction of the two legs, and
  `exists_iter_lt_card` preserves endpoints.

Formulas with no event contribute nothing and reuse the cycle built so far; the bound is stated
per-formula, so unused budget is simply not spent.

The statement is generic in the sequence so that the backward cycle can instantiate it at
`fun u => datum … (-u)` rather than duplicating two hundred lines with the temporal direction
flipped.

**A good forward cycle**: a cycle through a forward-recurring datum, of length at most
`cycleBound P φ`, on which every `untl` carried by the base datum has its event realised.

`RealizedStep` is `SeqStep` at the history's own datum sequence definitionally, so this is
`exists_good_cycle_of_seq` with the fulfilment obligation discharged by `typeAt_fulfillingSeq`
(`SmallModel.lean`) — the observation that a *genuine* history discharges its own eventualities
for free.

**A good backward cycle**, indexed by distance into the past.

`q 0` is the base datum, `q (j + 1)` sits one step *earlier* in time than `q j`, and every step is
a realised edge read in the forward direction — `RealizedStep (q (j + 1)) (q j)`. That is the form
the assembly needs, since a bi-lasso's `back` segment is still a forward walk in time; only the
search for `snce` witnesses runs leftward.

Obtained from `exists_good_cycle_of_seq` at the reversed datum sequence `fun u => datum … (-u)`,
which is exactly the mirror the plan prescribes.

**Two good cycles and periodicity give fulfilment.**

The hypotheses are exactly what the assembly produces: a locally coherent label sequence whose
labels are closure subsets, periodic with period `nb` strictly left of the origin and with period
`nf` at or past `nm`, whose forward cycle discharges every `untl` carried at `nm` somewhere in
`(nm, nm + nf]`, and whose backward cycle discharges every `snce` carried at `-1` somewhere in
`[-1 - nb, -1)`.

The argument, in the `untl` direction (the `snce` direction is its mirror), has two steps and both
are needed:

1. **Some delivery exists.** Suppose none did. Then `untl_propagates_to_end` carries the
   obligation arbitrarily far right; in particular to `nm + A` for a shift `A` that is a multiple
   of `nf` large enough to reach past `t`. Periodicity identifies that label with `lab nm`, where
   the good cycle supplies a delivery at some `s₀ ∈ (nm, nm + nf]`; shifting that delivery back by
   the same `A` lands it strictly right of `t` — contradiction. **This is where the cycle's
   goodness is spent**, and it is the only place it is needed.
2. **The interval guard is free.** Take `s` to be the *least* delivery strictly right of `t`
   (`Int.exists_least_of_bdd`; the set is bounded below by `t` and nonempty by step 1). Then no
   delivery occurs in `(t, s)`, so `untl_propagates_to_end` run to `s - 1` returns exactly the
   guard `FulfillingSeq` demands.

This is the prescribed sequence-level propagation route, not the sanctioned window-collapse
fallback: the collapse (`Decide.lean`'s `fulfilling_iff_window`) is stated for an `Annot`, whereas
the assembly needs the conclusion at bare sequences, before any `Annot` exists.
