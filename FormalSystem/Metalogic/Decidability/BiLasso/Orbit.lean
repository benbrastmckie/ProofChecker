# Orbit Decomposition: from a Window to a Bi-Lasso

This module supplies the construction that *produces* a `PlacedBiLasso` from a contiguous window
of states. The shape of the argument is the classical rho: follow the chosen successor out of the
window's right endpoint, and since the carrier is finite the orbit must revisit a state, so the
forward continuation splits into a finite **tail** followed by a finite **cycle**. Mirroring the
whole argument through `predOf` gives the same splitting to the left, and the two decompositions
plus the window are exactly the three segments a `BiLasso` carries.

## Where `Classical.choice` enters, and where it does not

Not in the pigeonhole. Every route to pigeonhole in Mathlib carries `Classical.choice` —
`Finset.card_le_card`, the most primitive counting statement in the library, already does — so a
revisit proved through the library would be choice-carrying. `exists_dup_lt` below avoids that by
proving pigeonhole on `Fin` directly, by deleting a value and inducting on the codomain, and
`orbit_repeat` / `orbit_repeat_pred` are consequently `[propext, Quot.sound]`.

Nor in the successor selection: `IntPresentation.succOf` is `[propext, Quot.sound]` and
`#eval`-able (`BiLasso/Successor.lean`).

Where it does enter is the assembly, through two incidental library facts: `BiLasso`'s decoding
lemmas (via `BiLasso.length_pos_int`, in a module held byte-stable and so not scrubbable here) and
Mathlib's `List.getD` indexing lemmas. `IntPresentation.extend_periodic`'s docstring carries the
full accounting.

## Main Definitions

- `IntPresentation.fwdTail` / `IntPresentation.fwdCycle` — the forward rho decomposition, as lists
- `IntPresentation.bwdTail` / `IntPresentation.bwdCycle` — the backward mirror, both in
  **increasing time order** so they drop straight into `BiLasso`'s segment convention

## Main Results

- `IntPresentation.orbit_repeat` / `IntPresentation.orbit_repeat_pred` — the pigeonhole
- `IntPresentation.iterSucc_periodic` / `IntPresentation.iterPred_periodic` — a repeat makes the
  orbit periodic from the repeat's first index onward
- `IntPresentation.fwdCycle_ne_nil` / `IntPresentation.bwdCycle_ne_nil` — both cycles are
  non-empty, which is what `BiLasso.back_ne` and `BiLasso.fwd_ne` demand
- `IntPresentation.fwdCycle_wrap` / `IntPresentation.bwdCycle_wrap` — the cycles close up

## A choice-free pigeonhole on `Fin`

Every pigeonhole in Mathlib carries `Classical.choice`, `Finset.card_le_card` included, because
`Finset.card` sits on `Multiset` / `Quot` machinery that pulls it in at the base. That is an API
fact rather than a logical obstruction: pigeonhole over a carrier with decidable equality is
constructively valid, and the proof below is a direct construction, measured at
`[propext, Quot.sound]`.

The induction deletes a value. Given a map `ℕ → Fin (N + 1)` on a window longer than `N + 1`,
either some earlier index already collides with the last one — found by `List.find?`, so the
search is a computation and not an appeal to excluded middle — or none does, in which case the
last value is missed by all the others and can be deleted from the codomain, shrinking `N + 1` to
`N` and invoking the inductive hypothesis.

**What this does and does not buy.** `orbit_repeat` and `orbit_repeat_pred` below become
choice-free. `IntPresentation.extend_periodic` does **not**: its conclusion asserts
`IsStepPath`, which routes through `BiLasso.unroll_isStepPath`, and that lemma is choice-carrying
for reasons entirely internal to the decoding module — which is held byte-stable and so is not
scrubbable from here. See `extend_periodic`'s own docstring for the resulting accounting.

**Pigeonhole on `Fin`, choice-free.** Any `n > N` consecutive values of a map into `Fin N` repeat,
and the repeat is exhibited by indices.

Measured at `[propext, Quot.sound]` — see this section's docstring for why that is worth the
duplication against Mathlib's own pigeonhole.

Both directions are recorded in **increasing time order**, which is `BiLasso`'s convention for

reverse it, because a larger `iterPred` index is an *earlier* time.

/-! ## The intended path of a window

Assembling a `BiLasso` from a window means writing down three lists whose decoding is a
particular bi-infinite path: the window on its own times, the backward orbit strictly before it,
the forward orbit strictly after it. That path is worth naming, because every adjacency obligation
the assembly incurs — the two within-segment chains, the two seams, and both wrap-arounds —
reduces to a statement about it.
-/

/-- The first entry of the window. -/
def winHead (P : IntPresentation) (win : List (Fin P.card)) : Fin P.card := win.getD 0 default

/-- The last entry of the window. -/
def winLast (P : IntPresentation) (win : List (Fin P.card)) : Fin P.card :=
  win.getD (win.length - 1) default

/-- The state immediately **before** the window: the chosen predecessor of its first entry. This
is the backward orbit's basepoint, sitting at absolute time `origin - 1`. -/
def winPred (P : IntPresentation) (win : List (Fin P.card)) : Fin P.card :=
  P.predOf (P.winHead win)

/-- The state immediately **after** the window: the chosen successor of its last entry. This is the
forward orbit's basepoint, sitting at absolute time `origin + |win|`. -/
def winSucc (P : IntPresentation) (win : List (Fin P.card)) : Fin P.card :=
  P.succOf (P.winLast win)

/--
**The intended path.** The window `win` occupies the absolute times
`[origin, origin + |win|)`; strictly to its left the path runs the backward orbit out of
`winPred`, and at or past `origin + |win|` the forward orbit out of `winSucc`.
-/
def windowPath (P : IntPresentation) (win : List (Fin P.card)) (origin : ℤ) (t : ℤ) :

  else if t < origin + (win.length : ℤ) then win.getD (t - origin).toNat default
  else P.iterSucc (P.winSucc win) (t - origin - (win.length : ℤ)).toNat

/--
**The intended path is a walk in the adjacency matrix**, at every integer time.

The five cases are the whole adjacency story of the assembly: within the backward orbit, across
the backward-to-window seam, within the window, across the window-to-forward seam, and within the
forward orbit. The two seams are exactly where `predOf_step` and `succOf_step` are spent; the
three within-segment cases are `iterPred_step`, the window's own hypothesis, and `iterSucc_step`.

The segment layout is fixed here, once, because `BiLasso`'s fields are positional and getting the
convention wrong is silent:

```
   back = bwdCycle          mid = bwdTail ++ win ++ fwdTail          fwd = fwdCycle
   (period, leftward)       (lasso times [0, |mid|))                 (period, rightward)
```

with the lasso's own time `0` sitting at absolute time `origin - |bwdTail|` — that is, at the
earliest time the backward pre-period reaches, since everything strictly left of it is already
covered by the periodic `back` segment.

**The three segments decode to the intended path**, throughout one full `coherent` window.

This is the single lemma that discharges `BiLasso.coherent` for the assembly: once the decoding is
known to agree with `windowPath` on `[-|back| - 1, |mid| + |fwd|]`, adjacency across that window is
`windowPath_step` and nothing else.

The range is closed at the top rather than half-open because `coherent`'s last index still asks
about the time one step further, and it is exactly at the two endpoints that the two repeat
hypotheses are spent — `hbeq` at `t = -|back| - 1`, where the leftward cycle wraps, and `hfeq` at
`t = |mid| + |fwd|`, where the rightward cycle does.

/-! ## The constructor

`lassoOfWindow` takes the window **and the two repeats as data** — the pair of orbit indices in
each direction, together with the proofs that they really are repeats. That is deliberate: a model
checker's search is what finds those indices, and handing them in keeps the constructor a genuine
computable `def` rather than something that must extract data from a `Prop`-level existential.
`IntPresentation.extend_periodic` is where the existentials are discharged, once, by pigeonhole.

/-! ## Tier A: the effective extension theorem -/

/--
**Effective periodic extension over a presented frame.**

Every non-empty contiguous window of adjacent states, placed at an arbitrary absolute time,
extends to a bi-infinite step path of the presented frame that is **finitely represented**: three
finite lists plus one integer origin, ultimately periodic in both directions with both periods
bounded by `P.card`. The certificate agrees with the window at every one of its own times, and
`BiLasso.coherent` — the property that makes the object a *valid* certificate rather than merely a
well-typed one — is a quantifier over a `Fin`, hence `decide`-able, so a consumer re-verifies a
received certificate without re-running this proof.

## No seriality hypothesis, and that is deliberate

The informal statement of this result says "given a serial relation". No seriality hypothesis
appears here because seriality is already a *field* of the input: `IntPresentation.fwd` and
`IntPresentation.bwd` are exactly forward and backward one-step seriality, and they are what make
`IntPresentation.succOf` and `IntPresentation.predOf` total. Adding a hypothesis would duplicate a
structure field. Read the absence as discharged, not as omitted.

## Contiguous windows only

The window is contiguous by construction — a `List` with adjacency between consecutive entries.
A partial history over a *gapped* finite domain is not handled at this tier; see the
`PartialHistory` wrapper's note below for why a gapped certificate would not be data, and where
the gapped case is delivered instead.

## ON CHOICE

Measured, not asserted:

```
'FormalSystem.Metalogic.Decidability.IntPresentation.extend_periodic' depends on axioms: [propext,
 Classical.choice,
 Quot.sound]
```

`Classical.choice` is present, from two sources, **neither of which is the successor selection**,
and **neither of which is finiteness**:

1. **The reused decoding lemmas.** `BiLasso.unroll_isStepPath` and both `BiLasso.unroll_*`
   periodicity lemmas measure `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`. It enters there
   incidentally, through `BiLasso.length_pos_int`'s `exact_mod_cast` step, and has nothing to do
   with `ℤ` or with the frame. That module is held byte-stable, so this source is not scrubbable
   from here.
2. **Mathlib's list-indexing API.** `List.getD_eq_getElem` and `List.getD_append` both measure
   `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`, and every segment-readout lemma here is stated in
   terms of `List.getD`, so `unrollOf_windowSegments` inherits it. The `Nat`-to-`ℤ` coercion step
   in `windowPath_step` carries it by the same mechanism as source 1.

**Pigeonhole is *not* a source, and its absence was work.** The obvious third source — the
finiteness API that forces the orbit to revisit a state — has been removed. Every route to
pigeonhole in Mathlib carries `Classical.choice`, `Finset.card_le_card` included, because
`Finset.card` sits on `Multiset` / `Quot` machinery that pulls it in at the base. That is an API
fact and not a logical obstruction: pigeonhole over a carrier with decidable equality is
constructively valid, and `exists_dup_lt` above proves it directly, by deleting a value and
inducting, at `[propext, Quot.sound]`. `IntPresentation.orbit_repeat` and
`IntPresentation.orbit_repeat_pred` are therefore choice-free.

The successor selection is not a source either. `IntPresentation.succOf` and
`IntPresentation.predOf` measure `[propext, Quot.sound]`, are built from `List.find?` over
`List.finRange`, and are `#eval`-able; so are the three segment lists `windowBack` / `windowMid` /
`windowFwd` this theorem's witness is assembled from, and the intended path `windowPath` they
decode to. The *data* of the certificate is computable throughout; what remains classical is the
*proofs about* it, and both remaining sources are incidental library facts about lists and
numeric coercions rather than anything about frames, finiteness, or time.

Contrast `TaskFrame.saturation_of_finite`, where the obstruction **is** logical and proved:
`wlem_of_saturation` derives weak excluded middle from *Saturation* at the carrier `Bool` over
`D = ℤ` from `[propext, Quot.sound]` alone, so a choice-free proof there would prove WLEM in
Lean's intuitionistic core and cannot exist. Nothing of that kind is known here, and nothing of
that kind is claimed. **No constructivity claim and no impossibility claim is made for
`extend_periodic`** — the two remaining sources look as scrubbable in principle as the pigeonhole
turned out to be, but neither is scrubbable from this module, and no more is asserted than has
been measured.

What *is* preserved, and is a real, non-vacuous difference from the general Extension Theorem:
**no Zorn.** This proof does not route through `PartialHistory.exists_maximal_extension`, and no
module created for it imports `FormalSystem.Semantics.Extension.Extension` — `Extends` and
`PartialHistory` come from `FormalSystem/Semantics/PartialHistory.lean`, which carries no Zorn
route. The general theorem is untouched and remains exactly as it is for arbitrary `W` and `D`;
this strengthens the finite discrete case only.

### The `PartialHistory` wrapper

`extend_periodic` takes the window as a list plus an absolute origin, which is the form a search
produces it in. The paper's hypothesis is a bounded convex history, so the statement is also given
here in `PartialHistory` vocabulary, over a domain that is exactly an integer interval `[a, b]`.

**Tier A is contiguous-window-only, and deliberately so.** `PartialHistory.domain` is an arbitrary
predicate, so `{0, 5}` is a legal domain with a four-time hole. Filling such a hole needs a path
between two states at a known distance, and the only tool for that here
(`FormalSystem.Semantics.exists_path_of_iter`) yields a `Prop`-level existential filler — so a
gapped certificate would not be *data*, which is the entire point of this tier. The gapped case is
delivered at the frame level instead, where a `Prop`-level conclusion is what is wanted anyway. A
computable gap filler would need a bounded path search over the presentation; that is recorded as
follow-up work rather than silently omitted.

**Effective periodic extension from a bounded partial history.** The same conclusion as
`IntPresentation.extend_periodic`, with the window supplied as a `PartialHistory` whose domain is
the integer interval `[a, b]`.
