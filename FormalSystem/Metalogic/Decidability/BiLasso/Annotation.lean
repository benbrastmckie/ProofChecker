# Annotated Bi-Lassos

A `BiLasso` presents a bi-infinite step path finitely. It does **not** present the *truth* of
formulas along that path: a machine-checked refutation
(`evidence/phase3-scan-bound-is-false.lean`, in this task's directory) shows that formula truth
along a bi-lasso is not a function of the state at a time and is not periodic in the time, even
though the state sequence is. The witness family is `prevⁿ p`, whose truth set along a fixed
`|back| = 1, |mid| = 0, |fwd| = 1` path is exactly `[n, ∞)`; since `n` is unbounded, no quantity
computed from the segment lengths alone bounds where truth must be looked for.

An **annotated** bi-lasso carries the missing information explicitly. Each position gets a
`Finset Formula` — its *type* — presented as three lists matching the three segment lengths and
decoded by the very same periodic scheme as the states. Label membership at a position **is** a
function of the annotation at that position, and the annotation is finite and periodic by
construction, so the scan bound the refutation kills for `TruthAt` is recovered verbatim for
label membership.

## Same decoding, not a parallel one

The label decoding is `Periodic.unrollOf` at `Finset Formula`; the state decoding is
`BiLasso.unrollOf` at `Fin P.card`. Both are the identical `emod` window scheme, and
`Annot.readIndex` together with `Annot.label_unroll_aligned` proves that at every time the two
consult the *same segment at the same offset*. That alignment is proved rather than assumed,
because a one-position slip between labels and states would make every clause relating a label
to its state silently wrong while remaining perfectly type-correct.

## Why the existing Hintikka machinery is not reused

`Metalogic/BXCanonical/Quasimodel/` already supplies `HintikkaPoint`, `HintikkaStep`,
`UntilDefect`, `SinceDefect` and `QuasimodelChain`. None of it is imported here, and the reason
is structural rather than stylistic:

- **`HintikkaPoint` is too weak.** Its only fields are `formulas`, `subset_sigma`,
  `locally_consistent` (no formula together with its negation) and `bot_free`. There is no atom
  clause, no `imp` clause and no box clause, so a `HintikkaPoint` does not determine truth of a
  compound formula from its parts. `LocalCoherent` below states all six clauses, and states them
  as **biconditionals**, which is exactly what lets the truth lemma run without any
  negation-completeness or maximal-consistent-set argument.
- **`HintikkaStep` is the wrong step relation.** It propagates `allFuture` / `allPast` — the
  Burgess–Xu completeness proof's requirement — rather than the exact ℤ one-step unfolding of
  `untl` / `snce` proved in `Unfold.lean`. Only the latter is an equivalence, and only an
  equivalence supports a local read-off of truth.
- **It sits on the proof-theoretic side.** `HintikkaPoint`s are produced from `BXPoint`s through
  the `noncomputable` `sigmaSignatureFormulas`. Importing that here would point the dependency
  from a computable decision layer into the maximal-consistent-set construction and drag
  `noncomputable` into `check`.

The `Quasimodel/` files are read-only from here and are not modified.

## Main Definitions

- `Annot` — the structure: a `BiLasso`, three label lists, three length agreements, and the
  closure-subset field
- `Annot.label` — the decoded label sequence `ℤ → Finset Formula`
- `Annot.readIndex` — the common segment offset that both decodings read at
- `LocalCoherent` — the six local Hintikka clauses, as biconditionals, at every position
- `Fulfilling` — the global eventuality-discharge condition, in both temporal directions
- `BoxOracleSound` — the correctness specification of a box oracle

## Main Results

- `Annot.label_unroll_aligned` — labels and states are read at the same index, at every time
- `Annot.label_sub_back_length` / `Annot.label_add_fwd_length` — the two label periodicities,
  at the same thresholds as `BiLasso.unroll_sub_back_length` / `BiLasso.unroll_add_fwd_length`
- `Annot.label_subset_closure` — every label is a subset of `subformulaClosure φ`

`LocalCoherent` and `Fulfilling` are not vacuous, and `Fulfilling` is strictly stronger than
`LocalCoherent`: `BiLasso/Examples.lean` exhibits an annotated lasso satisfying both, and a
second one satisfying `LocalCoherent` while **failing** `Fulfilling`.

An **annotated bi-lasso** over an `IntPresentation`, for a formula `φ`: a `BiLasso` together
with a per-position label drawn from `subformulaClosure φ`.

The labels are three plain `List (Finset Formula)` fields rather than a dependent packaging,
because the bounded enumeration downstream must build them by brute force and filter them with
`decide`; plain lists are `DecidableEq`, enumerable, and carry no proof obligations to transport
across the enumeration.

The three length agreements are what make the label decoding line up with the state decoding —
see `Annot.label_unroll_aligned`.

The common offset that time `t` is read at, stated in terms of the **lasso's** segment lengths.

Both the label decoding and the state decoding read their respective segment at this index. That
is the content of `label_unroll_aligned`; writing the index once, here, is what makes the two
provably the same term rather than two expressions that happen to look alike.

**Alignment: labels and states are read at the same index.**

At every time `t`, in whichever of the three regimes `t` falls, the label is the label list's
entry at `A.readIndex t` and the state is the state list's entry at the *same* `A.readIndex t`.

This is what rules out an off-by-one between the annotation and the path it annotates. It is
proved from the three length agreements — the label decoding's own thresholds and moduli are
stated with the *label* lengths, and every one of them must be transported to the corresponding
*state* length before the two indices are literally the same term.

## The three predicates the truth lemma consumes

`LocalCoherent` is what a label must satisfy *at and around each position*; `Fulfilling` is the
one condition that is irreducibly *global*; `BoxOracleSound` specifies the box oracle both are
stated relative to.

The split is the whole design. Fulfilment cannot be established inside the truth lemma's
induction, because it is not a local property — that is precisely what the abandoned
`RoundRobinChain` / `OracleStep` / `OracleCoherence` / `ScheduleBasedBFMCS` attempts foundered
on. Here it is a **hypothesis carried by the structure**, which the induction only ever consumes.
-/

/--
**Local coherence**: the Hintikka conditions, as biconditionals, at every position.

Each clause is guarded by membership in `subformulaClosure φ`, so a label is constrained only on
the formulas the decision problem is actually about. The `bot` clause is unconditional, since
`⊥` may not appear in any label whether or not it is in the closure.

**Biconditionals, not implications.** A one-directional Hintikka condition would leave a label
free to omit a formula that ought to be there, and the `→` direction of the truth lemma would
then be unprovable. Stating all six as `↔` is what makes a label negation-complete over the
closure with no maximal-consistent-set machinery anywhere in sight.

**Argument order is guard first**: `Formula.untl g e` has guard `g` and event `e`, matching
`Semantics/Truth.lean`. The two temporal clauses are literally the label-level transcription of
`truth_untl_succ` and `truth_snce_pred` from `Unfold.lean`, and that correspondence is what the
truth lemma's temporal cases exploit.

**The box clause is position-independent.** `Semantics.Truth.box_const` gives independence of
both the history *and* the time, so the truth of a boxed formula is a single fact about the
model, not a fact about a position. The oracle is therefore one `Formula → Bool` rather than a
per-position field of the annotation — a genuine simplification of the datatype, not a
convenience.
-/
def LocalCoherent (P : IntPresentation) (φ : Formula) (bx : Formula → Bool)
    (A : Annot P φ) : Prop :=
  ∀ t : ℤ,
    (∀ p : Atom, Formula.atom p ∈ subformulaClosure φ →
        (Formula.atom p ∈ A.label t ↔ P.val p (A.lasso.unroll t) = true)) ∧
    (Formula.bot ∉ A.label t) ∧
    (∀ a b : Formula, Formula.imp a b ∈ subformulaClosure φ →
        (Formula.imp a b ∈ A.label t ↔ (a ∈ A.label t → b ∈ A.label t))) ∧
    (∀ χ : Formula, Formula.box χ ∈ subformulaClosure φ →
        (Formula.box χ ∈ A.label t ↔ bx χ = true)) ∧
    (∀ g e : Formula, Formula.untl g e ∈ subformulaClosure φ →
        (Formula.untl g e ∈ A.label t ↔
          (e ∈ A.label (t + 1) ∨
            (g ∈ A.label (t + 1) ∧ Formula.untl g e ∈ A.label (t + 1))))) ∧
    (∀ g e : Formula, Formula.snce g e ∈ subformulaClosure φ →
        (Formula.snce g e ∈ A.label t ↔
          (e ∈ A.label (t - 1) ∨
            (g ∈ A.label (t - 1) ∧ Formula.snce g e ∈ A.label (t - 1)))))

/--
**Fulfilment**: every eventuality carried by a label is actually discharged.

`LocalCoherent`'s temporal clauses are satisfied by the *greatest* fixpoint — they permit an
`untl g e` to be passed forward forever, guard intact, event never delivered. `Fulfilling`
selects the *least* fixpoint by demanding a real witness. The gap between the two is exactly the
gap between "the label is locally consistent" and "the label describes a genuine model", and it
is not a technicality: `BiLasso/Examples.lean` exhibits a locally coherent annotation that fails
this condition.

Note that fulfilment is stated over **all** `g` and `e`, not only over closure members. Labels
are subsets of the closure anyway (`Annot.label_subset_closure`), so the extra generality costs
nothing and saves a closure side condition at every use site.

Argument order is guard first, matching `LocalCoherent` and `Semantics/Truth.lean`.
-/
def Fulfilling (P : IntPresentation) (φ : Formula) (A : Annot P φ) : Prop :=
  (∀ (t : ℤ) (g e : Formula), Formula.untl g e ∈ A.label t →
      ∃ s : ℤ, t < s ∧ e ∈ A.label s ∧ ∀ r : ℤ, t < r → r < s → g ∈ A.label r) ∧
  (∀ (t : ℤ) (g e : Formula), Formula.snce g e ∈ A.label t →
      ∃ s : ℤ, s < t ∧ e ∈ A.label s ∧ ∀ r : ℤ, s < r → r < t → g ∈ A.label r)

/--
**Soundness of a box oracle**: `bx χ` is `true` exactly when `χ` holds along every total world
history of the presented frame.

The time is fixed at `0` with no loss: `Semantics.Truth.box_const` makes the truth of a boxed
formula independent of both the history it is evaluated on and the time it is evaluated at, so
one `Bool` per formula is the whole content.

This is a *specification*, not a construction. It is stated here so the truth lemma can be
proved relative to any oracle meeting it, before any concrete oracle exists — which is what
breaks the circularity between the truth lemma and the oracle. `TruthAt`'s box clause quantifies
over all total histories of the frame, not over any enumerated family, so constructing an oracle
that meets this specification requires the small-model theorem and is deliberately deferred.
-/
def BoxOracleSound (P : IntPresentation) (bx : Formula → Bool) : Prop :=
  ∀ χ : Formula,
    bx χ = true ↔ ∀ σ : ConvexHistory P.toTaskFrame, σ.IsTotal → TruthAt P.toModel σ 0 χ
