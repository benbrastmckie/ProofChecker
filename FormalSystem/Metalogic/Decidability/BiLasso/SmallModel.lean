# The Type Sequence of a Genuine History

The small-model theorem extracts a bounded annotated bi-lasso from an arbitrary total history.
Whatever form the extraction takes, it needs one thing first: the *type sequence* of a genuine
history — the set of closure formulas true at each position — must satisfy the very conditions
an annotation is required to satisfy. That is what this module establishes.

## Where the conditions come from

- The **atom**, **`bot`** and **`imp`** clauses are immediate from `TruthAt`'s own clauses.
- The **box** clause is the box oracle's soundness, moved from time `0` to the position by
  `Semantics.Truth.box_const`.
- The two **temporal** clauses are exactly `truth_untl_succ` and `truth_snce_pred` from
  `BiLasso/Unfold.lean`. This is the point at which that module is consumed, and the reason it
  is a separate deliverable rather than an inlined step.
- **Fulfilment** is immediate, and that is the whole point of handoff §4.5's observation that
  fulfilment is supplied from outside and cheaply: a genuine history's eventualities are
  genuinely witnessed, because `TruthAt`'s `untl` clause *is* an existential witness. It is only
  when one tries to *construct* a structure that fulfilment becomes hard.

## Sequences, not annotations

`LocalCoherent` and `Fulfilling` are stated for an `Annot`, whose label sequence is periodic by
construction. A genuine history's type sequence is **not** periodic — the refutation in this
task's `evidence/phase3-scan-bound-is-false.lean` is precisely that formula truth along a
periodic path need not be periodic. So the conditions are restated here for an arbitrary pair of
sequences (`LocalCoherentSeq`, `FulfillingSeq`), with `localCoherent_iff_seq` /
`fulfilling_iff_seq` connecting them back to the annotation-level predicates.

## `typeAt` is deliberately noncomputable

`TruthAt`'s box clause quantifies over every possible world of the frame, so it is not
decidable, and `typeAt` filters by it through `Classical.decPred`. That is sound here because
`typeAt` appears **only inside proofs**: it is never reachable from `check`, whose own filters
are the computable instances of `BiLasso/Decide.lean`. No `open Classical` is used, and nothing
in this module is an instance that any decision procedure consults.

**The type sequence of a genuine history is locally coherent.**

Every clause is discharged from the semantics itself. The two temporal clauses are exactly the
ℤ one-step unfolding equations of `BiLasso/Unfold.lean`, transcribed through the closure filter;
the box clause is the oracle's soundness moved off time `0` by `box_const`.

**The type sequence of a genuine history is fulfilling.**

Immediate, and that is the substantive observation: `TruthAt`'s `untl` clause *is* an existential
witness, so a real model discharges its own eventualities by definition. Fulfilment is expensive
only when a structure has to be built; read off an existing model it is free. This is why the
truth lemma takes it as a hypothesis instead of establishing it.

/--
The pigeonhole datum the extraction must range over: the state together with the type.

`Fin P.card × Finset Formula` is not itself finite as a type, but the second component is
confined to `(subformulaClosure φ).powerset`, which is a `Finset`, so the datum ranges over a
finite set of size `P.card · 2^(subformulaClosureCard φ)`.

**Pigeonholing on the state alone is not sufficient**, and the reason is now machine-checked
rather than plausible. This task's `evidence/phase3-scan-bound-is-false.lean` exhibits a
bi-lasso with `|back| = 1`, `|mid| = 0`, `|fwd| = 1` — the shortest loop a state-only pigeonhole
can close — which admits **no** consistent annotation at all for a closure containing `prev⁵ p`:
any annotation on it is forced to give that formula the same membership at every `t ≥ 0`, while
its truth set along the path is exactly `[5, ∞)`. Requiring the *type* to repeat is what forces
the extracted loop to be long enough for the formula at hand.
