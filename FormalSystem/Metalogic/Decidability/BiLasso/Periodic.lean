# Generic Ultimately-Periodic Decoding in Both Directions

`BiLasso/Basic.lean` decodes three lists of *states* into a bi-infinite function `ℤ → Fin P.card`.
The annotation layer needs the identical decoding for three lists of *type labels*, and the two
must agree position for position or every clause relating a label to a state is off by one. This
module supplies the decoding once, at an arbitrary `[Inhabited α]`, so that both consumers are
instances of one scheme rather than two hand-aligned copies.

## Indexing convention

Identical to `Basic.lean`'s, and deliberately so:

```
 …  back[0] … back[|back|-1]   mid[0] … mid[|mid|-1]   fwd[0] … fwd[|fwd|-1]   fwd[0] …
                          ↑t = -1  ↑t = 0                              ↑t = |mid|+|fwd|-1
```

Both cycles are indexed left to right in time. `Int.emod` is non-negative at a positive modulus,
so `cyc` is already total at negative indices with no case split.

## Deliberate duplication against `Basic.lean`

`Basic.lean` is **held stable** for the benefit of the concurrent effective-periodic-extension
work, which is expected to consume it unchanged; refactoring its `cyc` / `unrollOf` onto the
generic definitions below is therefore explicitly out of scope here. The cost is that the `emod`
arithmetic appears twice — once at `Fin P.card` in `Basic.lean`, once at arbitrary `α` here.

That duplication is small (four short arithmetic lemmas and two periodicity proofs) and is
recorded rather than hidden. **The trigger that retires it**: once a shared periodic-sequence
presentation lands from the effective-periodic-extension work, `Basic.lean`'s `cyc` and
`unrollOf` should be redefined as the `Fin P.card` instances of this file's, and the duplicated
arithmetic deleted. That refactor belongs to whichever task owns the shared abstraction, not to
this one.

## Main Definitions

- `Periodic.cyc` — cyclic lookup into a non-empty list at an arbitrary integer index
- `Periodic.unrollOf` — the three-segment decoding

## Main Results

- `Periodic.unrollOf_sub_back_length` — leftward periodicity, period `|back|`, threshold `t < 0`
- `Periodic.unrollOf_add_fwd_length` — rightward periodicity, period `|fwd|`, threshold `|mid| ≤ t`

The three-segment decoding: `back` repeated leftward of the origin, `mid` on the window

Stated as a function of the three lists rather than of a structure, so that a structure's own
coherence field can mention it — the same reason `BiLasso.unrollOf` is stated this way.
