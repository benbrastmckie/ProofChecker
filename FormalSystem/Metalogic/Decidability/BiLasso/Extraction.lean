# The Small-Model Theorem, in the Windowed Shape

This module assembles the annotated bi-lasso a satisfying history is compressed into, and proves
the small-model theorem `exists_annot_of_truth`.

## Why the witness is delivered at a position, not at the origin

A `BiLasso`'s origin is **pinned**: `Basic.lean` decodes `back` repeated strictly left of `0`,
`mid` on `[0, |mid|)`, and `fwd` repeated at or past `|mid|`, so there is no left prefix. A
two-sided pigeonhole therefore forces the lasso's origin to sit at the *backward repeat*, and the
point of interest lands wherever the compressed mid segment puts it — not at position `0`.

Demanding otherwise demands a recurrence of the *type* at the point of interest, and no such
recurrence need exist. That is machine-checked, not conjectured:
`specs/417_semantic_fmp_finite_worldstate_over_z/evidence/phase10-origin-anchoring-obstruction.lean`
exhibits a total history whose closure formula `prev⁵ w` has truth set exactly `{0}`, so the type
at `0` recurs at no earlier time.

**Shifting the history does not rescue anchoring**, and it is worth saying why, because it looks
as though it should. `Semantics.TimeShift.timeShift_preserves_truth` (`Semantics/Truth.lean`)
moves truth along a time shift, and `WorldHistory.timeShift` of a total history is total. But the
decision procedure enumerates *lassos*, not histories: `timeShift τ i` is a perfectly good total
history and is simply not the `unroll` of any enumerated `BiLasso` whose origin sits where the
shift put it. So the extra degree of freedom has to live in the *consumer* — hence the `∃ i` in
the window below.

The concurrent effective-periodic-extension work makes the same degree of freedom structural, by
carrying an explicit `origin` alongside the lasso. The two are the same freedom expressed twice;
unifying them belongs to whichever layer owns the shared abstraction and is not done here.

## The assembly

Three walks in the realised-datum graph of `Realized.lean`, laid end to end:

| lasso times | segment | source |
|---|---|---|
| `[-nb, -1]` | `back` | the good **backward** cycle, read outward from time `-1` |
| `[0, nm)` | `mid` | the shortened walk from the backward cycle's base, *through the point of interest*, to the forward cycle's base |
| `[nm, nm + nf)` | `fwd` | the good **forward** cycle |

The mid walk is shortened in **two pieces** — base-to-point and point-to-base — precisely so that
the point of interest survives as a marked interior position; shortening the whole stretch at once
would be free to excise it. Its first leg additionally takes one real step before any shortening,
which keeps the leg length at least one and hence keeps the recorded position non-negative.

## Main Definitions

- `bound` — the enumeration bound `check` calls `boundedAnnots` at, as a closed arithmetic
  expression in `P.card` and `subformulaClosureCard φ`

## Main Results

- `coherent_of_window_step` — the converse of `BiLasso.step_of_mem_window`
- `periodic_rel_of_window` — any relation holding across one full window of a three-segment
  periodic decoding holds across every consecutive pair
- `witness_pos_mem_cohWindow` — a position in `[0, nm]` lies in the derived coherence window
- `exists_annot_of_truth` — **the small-model theorem**

Argument order is **guard first**: `Formula.untl g e`, `Formula.snce g e`.

**The converse of `BiLasso.step_of_mem_window`.**

`coherent` is a quantifier over `Fin (|back| + 1 + |mid| + |fwd|)` routed through
`BiLasso.windowTime`, whose image is exactly `[-|back| - 1, |mid| + |fwd|)`. So a statement over
that integer interval discharges the structure field directly.

This is index bookkeeping, deliberately isolated so that the assembly below never has to touch
`Basic.lean` — which is held stable for the concurrent effective-periodic-extension work.

**One full window suffices for any relation on a three-segment periodic decoding.**

Every integer reduces into `[-|back| - 1, |mid| + |fwd|)` modulo the relevant cycle length, and
the decoding depends only on the residue. This is `BiLasso.unroll_isStepPath`'s reduction, stated
once at an arbitrary carrier and an arbitrary relation so that the datum sequence can use it too —
the state sequence is not the only thing that has to step correctly at every time.

wraps to the base again — which is why the cycle's own closure `qb Lb = qb 0` is a hypothesis.

A closed arithmetic expression in `P.card` and `subformulaClosureCard φ` — not an existentially
quantified `n`, which `check` could not consume. `Check.lean` reads *this definition*; it never
restates the arithmetic.

The maximum of the two derived bounds. The cycle term dominates whenever
`subformulaClosureCard φ ≥ 1` — which always holds, since a formula belongs to its own closure —
so in practice `bound = cycleBound`; the `max` is taken anyway so that no closure lemma is needed
here and the definition stays correct unconditionally.

This is the formal content of "the windowed shape loses nothing": the extraction delivers its
witness somewhere in `[0, |mid|]`, and `Decide.lean`'s coherence window `[-2·nb, nm + 2·nf)`
contains that interval **unconditionally**, because `nb ≥ 1` and `nf ≥ 1` (`BiLasso.back_ne`,
`BiLasso.fwd_ne`). Note that a naive `Finset.Ico 0 A.nm` would silently drop the corner
`i = A.nm`, which is exactly where the witness lands when the mid walk's second leg collapses.

/-! ## The small-model theorem -/

/--
**The small-model theorem, in the windowed shape.**

If a closure formula holds at *some* time of *some* total history, then one of the finitely many
annotated bi-lassos with segments bounded by `bound P φ` carries it, at a position inside that
lasso's own coherence window, over the same state.

The witness position is quantified rather than fixed at `0`, and that is forced rather than
convenient — see the module docstring and
`specs/417_semantic_fmp_finite_worldstate_over_z/evidence/phase10-origin-anchoring-obstruction.lean`.
Nothing is weakened at the specification level: the predicate being decided is existential in the
time in either shape, since the hypothesis here is truth at an arbitrary `t`.

The proof compresses `τ` into three walks in the realised-datum graph and reassembles them:

- **`fwd`** is a good forward cycle through a datum recurring at arbitrarily large times;
- **`back`** is a good backward cycle through a datum recurring at arbitrarily small times;
- **`mid`** is the walk between the two, shortened in two legs so that the position of `t` survives
  as a marked interior point — and whose first leg takes one real step before shortening, so that
  the marked position is never negative.

Local coherence comes from `localCoherentSeq_of_edges` (the splice lemma) fed by
`coherentEdge_of_realizedStep`; fulfilment from `fulfilling_of_good_cycles`; the lasso's
`coherent` field from `coherent_of_window_step` fed by `realizedStep_step`.
