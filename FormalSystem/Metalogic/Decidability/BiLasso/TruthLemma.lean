# The Truth Lemma for Annotated Bi-Lassos

Along a locally coherent, fulfilling annotated bi-lasso, and relative to a sound box oracle,
truth at a position **equals membership in that position's label**, for every formula in the
closure. Evaluation is replaced by a read-off.

## Why fulfilment is a hypothesis and not a construction

This is the lasso instance of the general "truth along a fulfilling structure" lemma the
filtration-side development will need, and the reason it goes through here is structural:
`Fulfilling` is **carried by the structure** and only ever *consumed* by the induction below.

Earlier abandoned attempts in this repository — `RoundRobinChain`, `OracleStep`,
`OracleCoherence`, `ScheduleBasedBFMCS` — tried instead to *establish* fulfilment inside the
truth-lemma induction, by scheduling eventuality discharge as the induction proceeded. That
cannot work, and the obstruction is not technical: fulfilment is not a local property. Whether
an `untl` at a position is ever discharged depends on unboundedly much of the structure to the
right of that position, so no amount of local bookkeeping inside an induction on formula
structure can produce it. Separating the two — a local condition (`LocalCoherent`) plus a
global one (`Fulfilling`), both hypotheses — is what makes the induction routine.

`BiLasso/Examples.lean` shows the separation is real: `negAnnot` is locally coherent and not
fulfilling.

## The two nested inductions

The `untl` case's `→` direction carries the only genuine difficulty, and it runs **two** nested
inductions which are kept textually separate below:

- the **outer** induction is on the formula `ψ`, generalised over the time `t`;
- the **inner** induction, isolated as `untl_mem_label_of_witness`, is on the *distance*
  `(s - t).toNat` from the position to the semantic witness.

Conflating them is the standard way this proof goes wrong: the inner induction needs the outer
induction hypotheses for `g` and `e` **at every time**, which is exactly why the outer statement
is `∀ t` rather than fixed-`t`.

The `←` direction is immediate — `Fulfilling` hands over the witness directly.

## Argument order

Guard first: `Formula.untl g e` has guard `g`, event `e`, matching `Semantics/Truth.lean`.

## Main Results

**The inner induction of the `untl` case**: a semantic witness at distance `d` forces the
eventuality into the label.

Stated as a standalone lemma over the witness distance, with the outer induction's hypotheses
for the guard `g` and the event `e` passed in as `hg` and `he` — *at every time*, which is what
the recursion at `t + 1` requires. Keeping this separate from the induction on formula structure
is deliberate; see the module docstring.

At distance `1` the event is already at `t + 1` and the local clause's left disjunct fires. At
distance `d + 1` the guard is at `t + 1` by the interval hypothesis, the same witness `s` serves
at `t + 1` at distance `d`, and the clause's right disjunct fires.

**The truth lemma.** Along a locally coherent, fulfilling annotated bi-lasso, and relative to a
sound box oracle, `TruthAt` at a position is exactly membership in that position's label, for
every formula in `subformulaClosure φ`.

No restriction to a temporal-nesting-free fragment, no modal-depth bound, and no frame-class
side condition: the statement is over the whole closure, which is what makes it usable as the
decision layer's correctness core.

`truth_along_annot` with the position and the formula as ordinary leading arguments.

`truth_along_annot` itself must bind `ψ` outermost and `t` innermost, because the induction on
`ψ` needs its hypotheses at *every* time — the inner distance induction recurses at `t + 1`.
This restatement is the same proposition in the argument order call sites want, and
`A.lasso.toHF.val` is written out rather than abbreviated as `A.hist`.
