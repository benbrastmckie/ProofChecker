# The Box Oracle, by Modal-Depth Stratification

`BoxOracleSound` (`Annotation.lean`) is a *specification*, deliberately stated before any oracle
exists, so that the truth lemma could be proved relative to any oracle meeting it. This module
supplies a concrete oracle and proves it meets the specification, closing the last gap between the
truth lemma and a decision procedure.

## The circularity, and how the stratification breaks it

An oracle sound in the sense of `BoxOracleSound` decides *validity on the presented frame*:
`bx χ = true` exactly when `χ` holds at time `0` along every possible world. Deciding that
is exactly what the small-model theorem is for — and the small-model theorem consumes a sound
oracle. Circular, unless something decreases.

Something does: **modal depth**. The annotations `exists_annot_of_truth` enumerates for `¬χ` only
ever consult the oracle at formulas `ψ` with `□ψ ∈ subformulaClosure (¬χ)`, and every such `ψ`
satisfies `modalDepth ψ < modalDepth χ` (`modalDepth_lt_of_box_mem_closure`). So `boxOracle`
recurses on strictly smaller modal depth, and the recursion is well-founded.

## The interface problem, and the congruence that solves it

`BoxOracleSound` is a *global* condition — sound at every formula — while the stratified oracle is
only correct below its own depth. Weakening the hypothesis of the landed `truth_along_annot` is
not an option: it is landed and consumed.

The resolution does not touch either. `LocalCoherent P φ bx A` reads `bx` **only** at formulas `ψ`
with `□ψ ∈ subformulaClosure φ` (its box clause is guarded by exactly that), and `bx` enters
`boundedAnnots` through nothing else (`annotsOf` filters by `LocalCoherent` and by nothing that
mentions `bx`). So two oracles agreeing on the box-subformulas of `φ` enumerate the same
annotations — `mem_boundedAnnots_congr_oracle`. The soundness proof therefore runs the landed
machinery against the *classical* validity oracle, which is globally sound by construction, and
transfers membership back to the computed one.

That classical oracle is a proof-local object. It is never a definition, never an instance, and
never reachable from `check`; the computable `boxOracle` below is what the decision procedure
calls.

## Cost

No efficiency is claimed. `boxOracle P χ` enumerates every annotated bi-lasso with segments
bounded by `bound P (¬χ)`, and does so once per box-subformula stratum. The point is that it
terminates and is correct, not that it is fast.

## Main Definitions

- `boxOracle` — the stratified oracle, by well-founded recursion on `modalDepth`

## Main Results

- `modalDepth_lt_of_box_mem_closure` — the measure that makes the recursion well-founded
- `mem_boundedAnnots_congr_oracle` — the enumeration depends on the oracle only through the box
  subformulas of the annotated formula
- `boxOracle_sound` — **`BoxOracleSound P (boxOracle P)`**

Argument order is **guard first**: `Formula.untl g e`, `Formula.snce g e`.

**The measure that makes the stratification well-founded.**

Every formula the oracle is consulted at while deciding `χ` has strictly smaller modal depth than
`χ`: the oracle is only ever read at `ψ` with `□ψ` in the closure of `¬χ`, `□ψ` costs one unit of
depth, and negation costs none.

**Two oracles agreeing on the box subformulas of `φ` enumerate the same annotations.**

`bx` enters `boundedAnnots` through the `LocalCoherent` filter and through nothing else, and
`LocalCoherent`'s box clause is guarded by `□χ ∈ subformulaClosure φ`. This is what lets the
soundness proof below run the landed truth lemma against a globally sound oracle while the
*computation* uses the stratified one.

/-! ## The oracle -/

/--
**The box oracle**: `boxOracle P χ` is `true` exactly when no bounded annotated bi-lasso for `¬χ`
carries `¬χ` anywhere in its coherence window.

The oracle handed to the inner enumeration is `boxOracle P` itself, guarded by a strict decrease
in `modalDepth` — which is what makes the recursion well-founded, and which is legitimate because
the enumeration never reads the oracle above that depth
(`modalDepth_lt_of_box_mem_closure`). Below the guard the fallback value is irrelevant and is
`false`.

Computable: no `Classical.dec` anywhere on this path. The classical validity oracle appearing in
`boxOracle_sound` is proof-local and is not reachable from here.

/--
**The oracle meets its specification.**

Proved by induction on a bound for the modal depth. At each formula the argument is:

- the *classical* validity oracle `bxs` is globally `BoxOracleSound` by construction, so the
  landed `truth_along_annot_at` and this task's `exists_annot_of_truth` both apply to it;
- the stratified oracle agrees with `bxs` on every `ψ` with `□ψ ∈ subformulaClosure (¬χ)`, because
  all such `ψ` have strictly smaller modal depth and the induction hypothesis covers them;
- hence `mem_boundedAnnots_congr_oracle` transports annotations between the two enumerations in
  both directions.

The `←` direction of the specification is where the **time shift** is spent, and it is not
optional: `BoxOracleSound` is anchored at time `0`, while the windowed enumeration finds its
refuting witness at a position `i`. `timeShift_preserves_truth` together with
`ConvexHistory.isTotal_timeShift` moves the witness to `0`, which is exactly the obligation the
windowed shape of `exists_annot_of_truth` pushes downstream.
