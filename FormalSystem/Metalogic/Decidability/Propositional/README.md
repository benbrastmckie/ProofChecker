# Propositional — The Propositional Fragment of the Decision Procedure

The classical propositional core underneath the full bimodal tableau. Kept separate
because the propositional case is decidable by a self-contained Kalmár-style argument
that owes nothing to the modal or temporal machinery, and mixing the two would make
the bimodal decision procedure depend on a completeness result it does not need.

## Modules

| File | Lines | Role |
|------|------:|------|
| `PropForm.lean` | 234 | Propositional formula representation and the embedding of the propositional fragment of `Formula` |
| `Kalmar.lean` | 298 | Kalmár-style tautology soundness: a truth-table-valid propositional formula is derivable |
| `Decidable.lean` | 248 | Assembles the two into a decision procedure for the fragment |

## Position in the Layering

Inside `Metalogic/Decidability/`, beneath the full tableau procedure. `Decidable.lean`
imports `FormalSystem.Metalogic.Soundness` — the one place this fragment reaches outside
`Decidability/` — and all three modules are re-exported by the `Decidability.lean`
sibling aggregator.

Nothing here imports any of the three completeness routes (`BXCanonical/`,
`WeakCanonical/`, `Algebraic/`). That independence is the point: the propositional
decision procedure is usable without the completeness development.
