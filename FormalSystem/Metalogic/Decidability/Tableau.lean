# Tableau Rules for TM Bimodal Logic

This module defines the tableau expansion rules for the TM bimodal logic
decision procedure. The rules systematically decompose signed formulas
until branches close (contradiction found) or saturate (countermodel exists).

## Main Definitions

- `TableauRule`: Enumeration of all tableau expansion rules
- `RuleResult`: Result of applying a rule (linear extension or branching)
- `applyRule`: Apply a tableau rule to a signed formula
- `expandBranch`: Single-step expansion of a branch

## Tableau Rules

### Propositional Rules
- `andPos`: T(A ∧ B) → T(A), T(B) (non-branching)
- `andNeg`: F(A ∧ B) → F(A) | F(B) (branching)
- `orPos`: T(A ∨ B) → T(A) | T(B) (branching)
- `orNeg`: F(A ∨ B) → F(A), F(B) (non-branching)
- `impPos`: T(A → B) → F(A) | T(B) (branching)
- `impNeg`: F(A → B) → T(A), F(B) (non-branching)
- `negPos`: T(¬A) → F(A) (non-branching)
- `negNeg`: F(¬A) → T(A) (non-branching)

### Modal S5 Rules
- `boxPos`: T(□A) → propagate T(A) to accessible states
- `boxNeg`: F(□A) → create state with F(A)

### Temporal Rules
- `allFuturePos`: T(GA) → propagate T(A) to future times
- `allFutureNeg`: F(GA) → create future time with F(A)
- `allPastPos`: T(HA) → propagate T(A) to past times
- `allPastNeg`: F(HA) → create past time with F(A)

## Implementation Notes

Since TM combines S5 modal logic with linear temporal logic, we use a
simplified tableau system that exploits the special properties of S5
(all worlds are mutually accessible, so we can use a single equivalence class).

## Tableau Rule Type

/--
Tableau expansion rules for TM bimodal logic.

Each rule specifies how to decompose a signed formula. Rules are either:
- **Linear** (non-branching): Add formulas to the current branch
- **Branching**: Split into multiple branches (any must close for tableau to close)

  /-- Order trichotomy (R2, repairs D2). A positive witness `T(φ)` at a time `t1` and a
      positive `T(ψ)` at an incomparable sibling time `t2` (both after a common `t0`, same
      world) branch on the relative order of `t1` and `t2`, syntactically the three
      `temp_linearity` (BX11) disjuncts at `t0`:
      `T(F(φ ∧ ψ)) | T(F(φ ∧ F ψ)) | T(F(F φ ∧ ψ))`.
      Base rule: BX11 is a base axiom, so this is sound for every frame class. -/
  | orderTrichotomy
  /-- Dense: close branch when T(U(⊤,⊥)) appears (since ¬U(⊤,⊥) is a Dense axiom,
      asserting U(⊤,⊥) leads to contradiction on dense frames). Only applicable when fc >= .Dense.
      -/
  | denseIndicatorClosure
  /-- Dense: when T(G(φ)) at (w,t) and there exists a future time t' > t on the branch,
      introduce an intermediate time t'' with t < t'' < t' and add T(φ) at (w,t'').
      Captures density: between any two time points there is another. Only when fc >= .Dense. -/
  | densityRule
  /-- Discrete: when T(F(φ)) at (w,t), add T(U(φ, ¬φ)) at (w,t).
      Captures "nearest future φ-point reachable by Until". Only when fc >= .ZTime. -/
  | priorUZ
  /-- Discrete: when T(P(φ)) at (w,t), add T(S(φ, ¬φ)) at (w,t).
      Captures "nearest past φ-point reachable by Since". Only when fc >= .ZTime. -/
  | priorSZ
  /-- Discrete: when both T(G(G(φ) → φ)) and T(F(G(φ))) at same label,
      add T(G(φ)). Z1 backward induction axiom. Only when fc >= .ZTime. -/
  | z1Rule
  /-- Dedekind: Prior-U (gap form). When `T(U(⊤,φ) ∧ F(¬φ))` at `(w,t)`, add
      `T(U(¬φ ∨ K⁺(¬φ), φ))` at `(w,t)` — the φ-region has a definable right endpoint.
      Tableau counterpart of `Axiom.prior_U_gap`. Only when `fc >= .RTime`.
      NOT `priorUZ`, which is the integer well-ordering axiom at `.ZTime`. -/
  | priorUGap
  /-- Dedekind: Prior-S (gap form). Past dual of `priorUGap`: from
      `T(S(⊤,φ) ∧ P(¬φ))` add `T(S(¬φ ∨ K⁻(¬φ), φ))`.
      Tableau counterpart of `Axiom.prior_S_gap`. NOT `priorSZ`. -/
  | priorSGap
  /-- Dedekind: separation. From `T(K⁺φ ∧ ¬K⁺(φ ∧ U(φ,¬φ)))` add
      `T(K⁺(K⁺φ ∧ K⁻φ))`. Tableau counterpart of `Axiom.sep`. -/
  | sepRule
  /-- Seriality (BX1/BX1'). At any label, add `T(F ⊤)` and `T(P ⊤)` — the tableau images of
      `Axiom.serial_future` and `Axiom.serial_past` (`Axioms.lean:113, 117`). Persistent, and
      self-suppressing once both are on the branch at that label.

      Base rule in the soundness sense — both are base axioms, so it is sound for every frame
      class — but deliberately **absent from `allRulesForFC`**. It is keyed on the *label*, not
      on the formula's shape, so it applies to every signed formula on the branch, and any
      position in a per-formula priority list is the wrong one. See
      `serialityRules` / `expandOnce` for the globally-last scheduling it requires instead. -/
  | serialityRule
  /-- Time linearity (BX11, order level). Takes two times the branch knows but the ordering
      leaves incomparable and branches three ways on their relative position: `t₁ < t₂`,
      `t₂ < t₁`, or `t₁ = t₂`. Returns `.branchingOrdered`, because each arm needs a *different*
      `TimeOrdering` and the identification arm needs a different branch as well.

      **Arm 3 cannot be dropped.** `t₁ < t₂ ∨ t₁ = t₂ ∨ t₂ < t₁` is the trichotomy of a linear
      order; a two-arm version forces the two times to be distinct and loses exactly the models
      in which one instant witnesses both existentials.

      **Not a replacement for `orderTrichotomy`, and vice versa.** `orderTrichotomy` branches on
      `temp_linearity` *formulas*, which mint fresh witness times rather than ordering the two
      existing ones — which is why the W rows stayed incomparable while it was the only
      order-facing rule present. The two emit different things (formulas vs. ordering
      constraints) and coexist.

      Base rule in the soundness sense — `Axiom.temp_linearity` is a base axiom — but, like
      `serialityRule` and for the same reason, deliberately **absent from `allRulesForFC`**: it
      is keyed on the branch's time structure, not on any formula's shape. See
      `linearityRules` / `expandOnce` for the third-stage scheduling it requires. -/

## Rule Result Type
-/

/--
Result of applying a tableau rule to a signed formula.

- `linear`: Add formulas to the current branch (non-branching)
- `branching`: Split into multiple branches (all must close for validity)
- `notApplicable`: Rule doesn't apply to this signed formula
-/
inductive RuleResult : Type where
  /-- Add these signed formulas to the current branch. -/
  | linear (formulas : List SignedFormula)
  /-- Split into multiple branches (each is a list of formulas to add). -/
  | branching (branches : List (List SignedFormula))
  /--
  Split into multiple branches that constrain the **time ordering differently per branch**.

  Additive: `.branching` above is untouched and keeps its meaning, so every existing rule and
  every existing consumer is unaffected. Only a rule that genuinely needs a different
  `TimeOrdering` on each branch — today only `timeLinearity` — returns this constructor.

  **The payload is a list of replacement branches, not of deltas.** This is the one place where
  it differs from `.branching`, and the difference is forced rather than stylistic: the
  identification arm of `timeLinearity` has to *remove* a time from `Branch.knownTimes`, which no
  list of formulas-to-add can do. Arms that add nothing to the branch simply pass the branch
  through unchanged. `Branch` is an `abbrev` for `List SignedFormula`, so this is the same type
  the design note names.
  -/
  | branchingOrdered (branches : List (Branch × TimeOrdering))
  /-- Universal modal rule: add formulas but do NOT remove the source formula.
      Used for T(□A) and F(◇A) which must persist for propagation to new worlds. -/
  | persistent (formulas : List SignedFormula)
  /-- Rule does not apply to this signed formula. -/

## Formula Decomposition Helpers
-/

/--
Try to decompose a formula as negation (A → ⊥).
Returns `some A` if the formula is `A.imp .bot`, otherwise `none`.
-/
def asNeg? : Formula → Option Formula
  | .imp φ .bot => some φ
  | _ => none

/--
Try to decompose a formula as conjunction (¬(A → ¬B)).
Note: A ∧ B = (A.imp B.neg).neg = (A.imp (B.imp .bot)).imp .bot
Returns `some (A, B)` if it matches the pattern, otherwise `none`.
-/
def asAnd? : Formula → Option (Formula × Formula)
  | .imp (.imp φ (.imp ψ .bot)) .bot => some (φ, ψ)
  | _ => none

/--
Try to decompose a formula as disjunction (¬A → B).
Note: A ∨ B = A.neg.imp B = (A.imp .bot).imp B
Returns `some (A, B)` if it matches the pattern, otherwise `none`.
-/
def asOr? : Formula → Option (Formula × Formula)
  | .imp (.imp φ .bot) ψ => some (φ, ψ)
  | _ => none

/--
Try to decompose a formula as diamond (¬□¬A).
Note: ◇A = A.neg.box.neg = ((A.imp .bot).box).imp .bot
Returns `some A` if it matches the pattern, otherwise `none`.
-/
def asDiamond? : Formula → Option Formula
  | .imp (.box (.imp φ .bot)) .bot => some φ
  | _ => none

/--
Try to decompose a formula as somePast (PA = S(A, ⊤)).
Note: somePast A = snce top A = snce (imp bot bot) A
Returns `some A` if it matches the pattern, otherwise `none`.
-/
def asSomePast? : Formula → Option Formula
  | .somePast φ => some φ
  | _ => none

/--
Try to decompose a formula as someFuture (FA = U(A, ⊤)).
Note: someFuture A = untl top A = untl (imp bot bot) A
Returns `some A` if it matches the pattern, otherwise `none`.
-/
def asSomeFuture? : Formula → Option Formula
  | .someFuture φ => some φ
  | _ => none

/--
Try to decompose a formula as allFuture (GA = ¬F¬A = ¬(U(¬A, ⊤))).
Note: allFuture A = (someFuture A.neg).neg
Returns `some A` if it matches the pattern, otherwise `none`.
-/
def asAllFuture? : Formula → Option Formula
  | .allFuture φ => some φ
  | _ => none

/--
Try to decompose a formula as allPast (HA = ¬P¬A = ¬(S(¬A, ⊤))).
Note: allPast A = (somePast A.neg).neg
Returns `some A` if it matches the pattern, otherwise `none`.
-/
def asAllPast? : Formula → Option Formula
  | .allPast φ => some φ
  | _ => none

/--
Try to decompose a formula as a genuine Until (not someFuture).
Returns `some (event, guard)` if the formula is `untl guard event` with `guard != top`.
This filters out `someFuture φ = untl top φ` which is handled by someFuturePos/someFutureNeg.
Note the returned pair is *event-first*, the reverse of the constructor's guard-first arguments:
first component = event, second = guard.
-/
def asUntil? : Formula → Option (Formula × Formula)
  | .untl guard event =>
    if guard == Formula.top then none
    else some (event, guard)
  | _ => none

/--
Try to decompose a formula as a genuine Since (not somePast).
Returns `some (event, guard)` if the formula is `snce guard event` with `guard != top`.
This filters out `somePast φ = snce top φ` which is handled by somePastPos/somePastNeg.
Note the returned pair is *event-first*, the reverse of the constructor's guard-first arguments:
first component = event, second = guard.
-/
def asSince? : Formula → Option (Formula × Formula)
  | .snce guard event =>
    if guard == Formula.top then none
    else some (event, guard)
  | _ => none

/--
The first pair of branch times the ordering leaves incomparable, scanned in `knownTimes` order.

`timeLinearity`'s trigger, factored out so the rule's arm reads as a two-case match and the
stage lemmas can `rcases` on this call rather than on an inlined `findSome?` term.

Incomparable means exactly what `Saturation.timeOrderTotal` means by it — neither time is in the
other's transitive future — and the quantification is over `Branch.knownTimes`, with no
common-predecessor or shared-world side condition. See the rule's arm in `applyRule` for why the
narrower trigger cannot meet the totality criterion.

`boxDiamondPersistence` only ever relabels: everything it emits carries the formula of some
signed formula already on the branch.

Stated here, rather than where it is used, because `boxDiamondPersistence` is `private` and so is
opaque outside this module — and it appears in the output of six rules, which makes it the one
piece of `applyRule` the subformula property (`Verified/Termination/SubformulaProperty.lean`)
cannot reach on its own. The lemma is `Prop`-valued and additive; it changes nothing the engine
computes.

/--
Label-level companion to `mem_boxDiamondPersistence`.

`mem_boxDiamondPersistence` recovers only the *formula*: it says the emitted signed formula
carries the formula of some branch member, and is deliberately silent about label and sign.
That is enough for the subformula property and not enough for anything else. The four
fresh-time existential rules (`allFutureNeg`, `allPastNeg`, `someFuturePos`, `somePastPos`)
need to know *where* the contributed formulas land and with *which* sign, because their
soundness argument has to relate the fresh time `ft` back to the triggering time `t` inside
the one world `w`. This lemma supplies exactly that: the output sits at `(w, ft)`, and its
source sits at `(w, t)` on the branch carrying the same sign and the same formula.

Stated here for the same reason as its companion: `boxDiamondPersistence` is `private` and so
is opaque outside this module. Like it, this lemma is `Prop`-valued and additive — it changes
nothing the engine computes.

Shape companion to `mem_boxDiamondPersistence` and `mem_boxDiamondPersistence_label`.

Those two say *what formula* is emitted and *where* it lands; neither says what **shape** it has,
and shape is what the soundness argument turns on. `boxDiamondPersistence` copies a formula from
one time to another inside a single world, and a formula's truth is in general not time-invariant
— that is exactly the unsoundness that was removed from `boxNeg`/`diamondPos`. The copy is sound
here only because both source lists are restricted to modal formulas: `T(□A)` says
`∀ σ, σ.IsTotal → A` at the evaluation time, and `F(◇A)` says `∀ σ, σ.IsTotal → ¬A` at it, and a
claim universal over the total histories *is* time-invariant, because `timeShift` preserves
totality.

So a consumer needs to see the `□`/`◇` shape to invoke that time-invariance at all. This lemma supplies
it: everything emitted is either a positive `□` formula or a negative `◇` formula, `◇` in its
`¬□¬` encoding.

Stated here for the same reason as its two companions: `boxDiamondPersistence` is `private` and
so is opaque outside this module. Like them, it is `Prop`-valued and additive.

Apply a single tableau rule to a signed formula, in the context of the branch it
belongs to and the time ordering accumulated so far.

Returns the rule's outcome together with a possibly-extended time ordering:
`.linear fs` replaces the formula with `fs` on the same branch, `.branching bss`
splits the branch once per element of `bss`, `.persistent fs` adds `fs` while
keeping the formula, and `.notApplicable` means the rule does not match this
sign/connective pair. Rules that introduce a fresh time (the temporal and
diamond rules) are what extend the returned `TimeOrdering`.

The two world-minting rules (`.boxNeg`, `.diamondPos`) emit exactly
`witness :: boxProps ++ diaProps`: the existential witness, plus the modal
universals `T(□B)` and `F(◇B)` re-labelled into the fresh world. They emit
**no temporal formulas**. Copying `T(Gφ)`, `T(Hφ)`, `F(Fφ)`, `F(Pφ)`,
`F(U(φ,ψ))` or `F(S(φ,ψ))` from the triggering label's time into the fresh
world would assert of an alternative world what is only known of the history
being built — precisely the distinction `□`/`◇` quantify over — and six such
copy blocks per rule were removed for that reason. Do not reintroduce them, in
narrowed form or otherwise. Note the contrast with the *time*-minting rules
below, whose `boxDiamondPersistence` calls relabel `T(□A)`/`F(◇A)` across
times *within one world*; that is sound and is unaffected.

**The same prohibition on the time axis.** `.untlPos` and `.sncePos` used to copy every
`F(U(e',g'))` (resp. `F(S(e',g'))`) standing at the trigger's time into the *freshly minted
time*. `Formula.untl`/`Formula.snce` are evaluated inside a single history and their truth is
interval-relative, so such a copy asserts at a later instant what is only known at an earlier
one. It is not rescued by the time-invariance argument, because the claim is not universal over
the total histories, and no
syntactic guard computable from `(branch, timeOrd)` expresses the semantic condition under which
the copy would be sound. Both blocks were removed; do not reintroduce them, in guarded form or
otherwise. Deleting them can only make branches *harder* to close, and the full conformance
corpus is unchanged by the deletion while
`Tests/BimodalTest/UntlSnceCopyProbe.lean` section C now returns a countermodel for an invalid
`Until` implication where it previously exhausted its fuel.

**Still outstanding, deliberately.** The PASSIVE arms of `.untlNeg`/`.snceNeg` place the guard
failure *at* the target time rather than strictly between, and re-assert the negative
`Until`/`Since` there. That is a second, independent unsoundness of the same interval-relative
family; it is measured by `UntlSnceCopyProbe.lean` section B and is NOT repaired here, because
the sound restatement converts the arm into a fresh-time producer with termination and
completeness consequences that must be designed.

  -- (`Axioms.lean:238`) is `F φ ∧ F ψ → F(φ ∧ ψ) ∨ F(φ ∧ F ψ) ∨ F(F φ ∧ ψ)`, and those three
  -- disjuncts *are* the trichotomy on two future witnesses: they coincide, the φ-witness
  -- comes first, or the ψ-witness comes first. Emitting them verbatim rather than as fresh
  -- ordering constraints keeps the rule's admissibility obligation a single appeal to BX11
  -- instead of a semantic argument about `TimeOrdering`, and it is the form the Phase 3
  -- `RuleSpec` gate maps to `Axiom.temp_linearity`.
  --
  -- **Why the trigger is a witness formula and not the eventuality.** The obvious trigger —
  -- `T(F φ)` with a partner `T(F ψ)` at the same label — never fires in practice, because
  -- `someFuturePos` is consumable: on `F φ ∧ F ψ → …` the branch reaches
  -- `T(F φ) @ t0` while `T(F ψ) @ t0` is still buried inside an undecomposed conjunction,
  -- `someFuturePos` consumes `T(F φ)` immediately, and the pair never coexists. The rule
  -- therefore triggers on the *witness*: a positive formula `T(φ) @ (w, t1)` looks back for
  -- a common predecessor `t0` and sideways for an incomparable sibling `t2` carrying
  -- `T(ψ)`, which is exactly the D2 configuration (two fresh times, both after `t0`, with
  -- no order between them).
  --
  -- **Branching restriction (the `3^k` containment).**
  --
  -- 1. *Incomparable time pairs.* `t1 ≠ t2`, neither is in the other's transitive future or
  --    past, and both lie in `futureOf t0`. The common predecessor is required because the
  --    BX11 instance being used is the one *at* `t0`: without it there is no point at which
  --    `F φ ∧ F ψ` holds and the split is not an axiom instance at all.
  -- 2. *Shared world.* `t1`, `t2` and `t0` are read at `l.world` throughout. Times are
  --    world-indexed here, so a pair drawn across two worlds is not a temporal-order
  --    question.
  -- 3. *Shared temporal formula (analytic restriction).* The split fires only when the
  --    branch already carries, at `(w, t0)`, the negation of at least one of the three
  --    disjuncts. This is what makes the rule analytic with respect to the branch: it never
  --    introduces a BX11 instance that no formula on the branch is about, so the branching
  --    is bounded by the negated eventualities present rather than by the square of the
  --    formulas at incomparable times. It is a genuine restriction, and it is the one the
  --    plan's Risk 1 flags for re-examination: if a conformance row that should CLOSE stays
  --    OPEN, this guard is the first suspect.
  -- 4. *No re-firing, in two halves.* A split must not repeat for a pair whose order the
  --    branch has already fixed, and the evidence for "already fixed" changes shape as the
  --    branch grows, so both halves are needed:
  --      (a) one of the three disjuncts is still present, positive, at some time of this
  --          world — the split fired and its conclusion has not yet been decomposed;
  --      (b) the conclusion *has* been decomposed: `someFuturePos` consumed the disjunct
  --          and left witnesses, so some φ-time and some ψ-time after `t0` are now equal
  --          or ordered. This is the half that makes the rule terminate. Guard (a) alone
  --          is not enough precisely because `someFuturePos` is consumable: the disjunct
  --          it removes was the only record that the pair had been split, so the trigger
  --          recurs at the freshly created time and the branch regresses without bound.
  --          Measured with only (a): counterexample B and the plain `F p ∧ F q` corpus
  --          rows STALLED at fuel 20000, the trace showing `orderTrichotomy` firing once
  --          per newly created time. Guard (b) is also the exact statement of what the
  --          rule is for — once the two witness sets are comparable, the trichotomy has
  --          been decided and there is nothing left to branch on.
  --    Guards (a) and (b) together still leave a window: the split's conclusion can be
  --    consumed by `someFuturePos` and its witness only *partly* decomposed, so that for a
  --    step or two neither (a) nor (b) holds and the pair re-fires at the newly created
  --    time. The third half closes it — *first witnesses only*: the pair fires only while
  --    each operand has at most one witness after `t0`. A second φ-witness can only exist
  --    because something already produced one, which is precisely the state the split was
  --    meant to reach. This is what makes the branch count finite: without it the trace
  --    shows `orderTrichotomy` firing at time 2, 3, 4, … forever, one new direct successor
  --    of `t0` per firing.
  --
  -- Neither operand may be a conjunction: every formula this rule produces has a
  -- conjunction under the `F`, so that restriction is exactly "the rule does not consume
  -- its own output".
  --
  -- The trigger formula is re-added to each branch (`.branching` deletes the expanded
  -- formula, and a witness atom must survive to close the branch against its negation).

  -- `t₂` whatever its magnitude. Which numeral survives is semantically arbitrary — identification
  -- asserts the two instants are the *same*, and nothing in the semantics reads a time index's
  -- magnitude — so the orientation costs nothing. What it buys is that `Branch.maxTime` cannot
  -- *fall* here: the surviving numeral is the larger of a pair both of whose members are known
  -- times, so the branch loses only a time that was not its maximum. Since this is the engine's
  -- single non-additive branch step (checked, not cited: `expandOnce_branch_shape_census`), that
  -- makes `Branch.maxTime` — and hence `Branch.nextTime`, which is `maxTime + 1` by a definition
  -- this repair leaves byte-unchanged — non-decreasing across a whole run, so no mint can ever
  -- re-issue an index an earlier identification retired.
  --
  -- The configuration this closes is `nextTime_reissues_retired_time`, whose branch
  -- `[p@⟨0,0⟩, q@⟨0,1⟩, r@⟨0,2⟩]` under `⟨[(0, 1)]⟩` triggers at `(0, 2)`: the unoriented arm
  -- retired the branch maximum `2`, dropped `maxTime` from `2` to `1`, and re-minted `2` two
  -- engine steps later (`reuse_driven_through_engine`). Oriented, it retires `0` and `maxTime`

## Applied-Set Tracking

Persistent rules (boxPos, diamondNeg, allFuturePos, allPastPos, boxTemporal,
someFutureNeg, somePastNeg, untlNeg, snceNeg) keep their source formula on the
branch and propagate consequences. If a consumable rule later removes a propagated
formula, the persistent rule sees it as "new" and re-adds it, creating an infinite
loop. The `AppliedSet` tracks signed formulas that have already been produced by
persistent rules. When a persistent rule's output formulas are ALL already in the
applied set, the rule is treated as not applicable.

### Seriality is scheduled, not prioritised

`serialityRule` is **not** in `allRulesForFC` and must not be added to it. It is keyed on the
label rather than the formula, so it is applicable to *every* signed formula on the branch, and
`findUnexpanded` returns the first formula for which *any* rule applies. Putting seriality last
in the priority list therefore makes it last **per formula**, which is not what is wanted: if the
first formula on the branch happens to have no other applicable rule, seriality fires there while
real work is still pending further down, mints a time, and the resulting serial chain trips
blocking before the closure is found.

Measured on the corpus prototype at `.Base`: last-per-formula regresses `C5 K_G`, counterexample
`A` and `S4` to open at fuel 300 *and* at fuel 3000 (so not a fuel artefact), while last-globally
hits all 24 targets at fuel 3000 and at fuel 200.

"Last globally" means: fire seriality only when *no* formula on the branch has any ordinary rule
applicable. That is a property of the expansion step, not of a priority list, so it lives in
`expandOnce` as an explicit two-stage pick and cannot be broken by a future edit to the list.

**Contrast with the Dedekind arm above**, which is *prepended* for the opposite reason: those
rules trigger on a conjunction that the consumable propositional rules destroy on their next
step, so they must be consulted early or they are dead code. Both are scheduling lessons, in
opposite directions, and neither is expressible as "put it in the right place in one list".

### Time linearity: the third stage, and the engine defect scheduling it exposed

`timeLinearity` is now wired into `expandOnce` / `expandOnceUnblocked` as the third stage, and
all seven `TimeOrderProbe` rows read `total=true incomparable=[]`. The history below is kept
because it identifies a live invariant of the engine that this rule was merely the first thing
to test.

Scheduling this stage against the *old* `expandBranchWithFuel` made the engine report
`F p → F(F p)` as CLOSED at `.Base` (conformance row C4, `target=OPEN`: there is no density
over an arbitrary linear order, and ℤ with `p` true only at `1` is a countermodel). That was a
real unsoundness, and it was **not** a defect in this rule:

- identification arm alone → OPEN, with a genuinely total order (`5 < 0 < 1 < 2 < 4`) that is a
  correct countermodel; arms 2+3 → OPEN likewise. Any variant containing arm 1 → CLOSED.
- Calling `expandBranchWithFuel` directly showed it returning `.inr openBranch` — an **open**
  branch — for which `findUnexpanded ≠ none`. The fuel loop was handing back a branch saturated
  only in the *unblocked* sense.
- Its split fold short-circuited on the first sub-branch that came back `.inr` and never
  explored the remaining arms. `buildTableau` then ran `saturateBlocked` on that branch, which
  closed it, and reported `.allClosed` — so the abandoned sibling arms were silently counted as
  closed.

The defect was in the open-branch contract between the split fold and the post-blocking pass,
not in the trichotomy: pre-existing, and merely *exposed* here, because it needs a rule whose
arms come back open-but-not-saturated and no corpus row produced one before. It is repaired in
`Saturation.resolveOpenArm`, which settles each arm while its siblings are still in scope. With
that in place C4 stays OPEN and the stage is sound to schedule.

**The invariant to preserve.** Any future rule whose arms can come back open-but-not-saturated
is subject to the same contract: an arm that cannot be settled must propagate as fuel
exhaustion, never as a closure. `resolveOpenArm` is where that is enforced.

### It goes third, after seriality

`timeLinearity` is not in `allRulesForFC` either, for the same reason as `serialityRule` — it is
keyed on the branch's time structure rather than on any formula's shape — but its stage belongs
*after* seriality's, not alongside it, and the order between the two is forced rather than
stylistic.

Seriality mints times. Time linearity orders the times that exist. Running linearity first would
order a time structure that seriality then extends, and every extension reintroduces
incomparabilities — the two stages would ping-pong, and each linearity firing is a **three-way
split**, so the ping-pong is paid for in branches rather than in steps. Running it strictly last
means the ordering work is done once, against a time structure nothing else is going to grow.

That is also why it is not merged into `serialityRules`: `findApplicableSerialRule` walks its
list per *formula*, so a two-element list would let linearity fire at the first formula seriality
happens to have nothing to do at, which is the same "last per formula, not last globally" defect
the section above measured for seriality itself.

## Uniform Branch Guards

The persistent rules have always been self-guarded: each one filters its own output against
`branch.contains` and reports `.notApplicable` when nothing new remains. The `.linear` and
`.branching` rules were not, and did not need to be — they were *destructive*, deleting their
source from the branch, so they could not re-fire.

Destruction is what made the applied set necessary, and it made it necessary for a reason
that has nothing to do with the persistent rules themselves. `boxPos` produces `T(¬p)`;
`negPos` consumes `T(¬p)`; `boxPos`'s own guard now sees its output missing and re-emits it;
`negPos` consumes it again. The cycle is driven by the consumable rule deleting the persistent
rule's output, not by the persistent rule ignoring the branch.

So the fix is to stop deleting, and to give the consumable arms the guard the persistent arms
already have. `untlNeg` and `snceNeg` are the in-repo precedent: both re-include their source
formula in every arm and are guarded by their own `unprocessed` filter, and both have always
been non-destructive.

**The fresh-label complication.** Eight rules mint a fresh world or a fresh time, so their
outputs live at a label that by construction is not on the branch. `fs.all branch.contains`
can therefore never suppress them, and non-destructive application would mint labels forever.
For those eight, output-presence is replaced by *witness existence*: the rule is suppressed
when the branch already carries a witness of the right shape at some already-known world (for
the modal rules) or at some already-ordered time (for the temporal ones). This is the standard
"do not duplicate an existing witness" restriction and is satisfiability-preserving in both
directions, exactly as the output-presence guard is.

`densityRule` also mints a fresh time but is deliberately absent from the list below: it
carries its own equivalent guard (`existingIntermediates.isEmpty`), which is the same test
specialised to the intermediate it would create.

With both guards in place every expansion step strictly adds at least one formula the branch
did not have, so branch length is a strict progress measure and the applied set has no work
left to do.
-/

/--
Rules whose output lives at a freshly-minted world or time, and which therefore cannot be
suppressed by testing their output against the branch.

`densityRule` mints a fresh time too but is not listed: its `existingIntermediates` guard is
already the witness test specialised to its own witness shape.

  | .boxNeg | .diamondPos | .allFutureNeg | .allPastNeg
  | .someFuturePos | .somePastPos | .untlPos | .sncePos => true
  | _ => false

/--
Rules that already suppress themselves, and so need no guard added in `findApplicableRule`.

`untlNeg` and `snceNeg` return `.branching`, but they filter the times they act on through
their own `unprocessed` test — a target time counts only when *neither* co-decomposition
output is on the branch yet — and they re-include the source formula in every arm. They are
therefore self-guarded and non-destructive already, by exactly the argument that makes the
`.persistent` arms self-guarded. Re-guarding them here would add nothing operationally (the
outer test can never fire where the inner filter has already passed) while putting an extra
`if` between the saturation lemmas and the filter structure they read.

/--
Does the branch already carry a witness for this fresh-label rule at this formula?

The witness test per rule, at label `(w, t)`:

- `boxNeg` / `diamondPos` — the modal accessibility relation is universal (S5), so any known
  world serves: some `w'` with `F(ψ) @ (w', t)` (resp. `T(ψ) @ (w', t)`) on the branch.
- `allFutureNeg` / `someFuturePos` — some `t'` strictly after `t` in the *transitive* ordering
  carrying `F(ψ)` (resp. `T(ψ)`) at `w`.
- `allPastNeg` / `somePastPos` — the past-directed mirrors.
- `untlPos` / `sncePos` — either arm counts, since the rule's conclusion is a disjunction: a
  future (resp. past) time carrying the event witness, or one carrying both the guard and the
  Until/Since itself.

Returns `false` for every other rule, so it is only ever consulted behind
`ruleMintsFreshLabel`.

/--
Is this fresh-label rule's witness obligation discharged by the *validity of its event*, with no
witness formula needed at all?

The only event this fires on is the syntactic constant `⊤` (`Formula.top`,
`FormalSystem/Syntax/Formula.lean:118`), reached through the two derived existential temporal
operators: `F ⊤` is `untl ⊤ ⊤` and `P ⊤` is `snce ⊤ ⊤` (`Formula.someFuture` / `Formula.somePast`,
`Formula.lean:131` / `:141`). On such a trigger the test is *purely* that the ordering already has
some strictly-later (resp. strictly-earlier) time; the branch is not consulted.

**Soundness.** `⊤` is true at every label of every model. So if the ordering already puts some
`t' ∈ timeOrd.futureOf l.time`, that `t'` *is* a witness for `T(F ⊤) @ (w, t)` whether or not the
branch literally carries `T(⊤) @ (w, t')` — the semantic obligation "some future time satisfies
the event" is discharged by an already-ordered time alone. Acting on that is
satisfiability-preserving in both directions, by exactly the argument the existing witness guard
already gives above (`Tableau.lean:1786-1787`: "do not duplicate an existing witness"), specialised
here to an event formula that needs no witness to duplicate. The past-directed arms are the
time-reversal mirror.

**Warning — do not generalise the event.** The argument above is available *only* because the
event is valid. For any event `ψ` that is not valid, an already-ordered `t'` is not thereby a
witness (`ψ` may fail at `t'`), and suppressing or redirecting the mint on that basis would be
UNSOUND: it would report a branch as saturated while the existential obligation is undischarged,
losing a closure the tableau is required to find. Keying on the syntactic `Formula.top` is
therefore load-bearing, not a convenience. Widening this predicate to any other event requires a
validity proof for that event, not a plausibility argument.

Returns `false` for every other rule and every other trigger shape, so — like `witnessPresent`,
beside which it is consulted and which it never replaces — it is only ever read behind
`ruleMintsFreshLabel`.

## Blocking Against Saturated Ancestors Only

`findBlockedTime` (`SignedFormula.lean`) decides subset blocking from formula *content* alone:
time `t` is blocked by an ancestor `t_anc` when `type(t) ⊆ type(t_anc)` and every eventuality
pending at `t` is duplicated at `t_anc`. Its soundness story is "everything available at `t` is
already available at `t_anc`, so expanding `t` yields nothing new" — and that story is only true
of the *finished* type at `t_anc`. While `t_anc` still has an applicable rule, `type(t_anc)` is
a moving target: the containment being observed is an artifact of `t_anc` not having been
expanded yet, not evidence of a repetition.

Consuming that decision as "treat the whole branch as a saturated open branch"
(`Saturation.lean`) is where it does damage: the branch is handed back with propagation
outstanding, so a branch that would have closed instead reports open, or stalls.

**Measured instance.** Counterexample row B (`(F p ∧ F q) → (F(p ∧ F q) ∨ F(p ∧ q) ∨
F(q ∧ F p))`) at `.Dense`/`.RTime`: `densityRule` interpolates times 3 and 4 into `0 < 2`,
giving ordering `[(4,3),(0,4),(3,2),(0,3),(0,2),(0,1)]`. The interpolated times carry types that
are subsets of their ancestors' *because the ancestors have not finished expanding* —
`findUnexpanded` still points at `T(G ¬(p ∧ F q)) @ (0,0)`, i.e. at the root, which is an
ancestor of everything. Blocking fires against time 0 and the branch is abandoned. Under the
destructive engine the intermediate times carried fewer formulas and the subset test read
differently, which is why the defect only became visible with non-destructive expansion.

**The repair is a side condition, not a strengthening.** Note the direction carefully: this
predicate fires strictly *less* often than `findBlockedTime`, so it can only let expansion run
longer. It does not widen what counts as blocked, and it does not add a new halting reason.
The termination argument is unaffected — expansion remains fuel-bounded, and blocking was never
what bounded it.

**Why `t_anc` and not `t`.** The saturation demand is on the *ancestor*, the time whose type is
standing in for the blocked time's. Demanding it of `t` instead would be a different (and
wrong) predicate: `t`'s own unexpanded formulas are precisely what blocking is entitled to skip,
since the ancestor subsumes them.
-/

/--
Every formula on the branch at time `t` is fully expanded: no rule of `fc` applies to any of
them against the current branch.

This is `findUnexpanded` restricted to one time. It reads the same
`findApplicableRule`-is-`none` condition, so it inherits the uniform branch guards: a rule whose
conclusion the branch already carries does not count as applicable, and therefore does not keep
a time perpetually unsaturated.

The times `t` may be blocked *against*: order-related times that were created **earlier**.

`ancestorTimes` alone is `ord.pastOf t` (`SignedFormula.lean:782`), which is the right candidate
set only for chains that grow into the future. A time minted by `somePastPos` is placed strictly
before everything on the branch, so its `pastOf` is empty and it can never be blocked — and
`serialityRule` demands a predecessor at *every* label, so the past-directed chain
`T(P⊤)@t ⟶ t' ⟶ t'' ⟶ …` runs to fuel exhaustion. Measured before this repair: the bare atom `p`
at `.Base` consumed all 200 fuel, reaching 266 formulas over 68 times in 88 s; after it, 7 steps
in 1 ms.

The `t' < t` filter is what keeps the added arm well-founded: fresh times are minted at
`Branch.nextTime = maxTime + 1` (`SignedFormula.lean:363`), so numeric index order **is** creation
order, and a time can only be blocked by one created strictly before it. Without the filter a time
and its own future witness could block each other.

`ancestorTimes` is retained unfiltered, so this arm is purely additive: no candidate the previous
predicate considered is dropped. (Measured: with this change and seriality *off*, the entire
four-class corpus, `CertificateProbe` and `TimeOrderProbe` are unmoved.)

This is the predicate the fuel loop consumes; `findBlockedTime` is retained in

*lemmas* there are stated against, since those lemmas are about the subset condition itself).

The `&&` chain is short-circuiting, so the comparatively expensive `timeSaturated` call runs
only for ancestor pairs that already passed the cheap subset and eventuality tests.

## Blocking Blocks a Time, Not the Branch

The ancestor-saturation side condition above is necessary but not sufficient, and the measurement
says so. With it in place, row B at `.Dense` halts on a branch whose state is

```
len=35 times=[4,3,1,2,0] ord=[(4,3),(0,4),(3,2),(0,3),(0,2),(0,1)]
blockedSat=(some 3) unexpanded=(some @time 0)
```

Time 3 is genuinely blocked — by the interpolated time 4, which really is saturated, so the
side condition is satisfied and the block is legitimate *about time 3*. What is not legitimate
is the conclusion the fuel loop drew from it: it treated one blocked time as a verdict on the
whole branch and handed the branch back as "saturated open" with unexpanded work still sitting
at time 0, the root.

That is the eagerness. Blocking is a statement about a **time**: expanding *from* `t` cannot
produce anything the ancestor does not already offer. It says nothing about times that are not
blocked, and the root is never blocked (it has no ancestors). So a blocked time is skipped as an
expansion **source**, and the branch is saturated only when no *unblocked* formula has an
applicable rule.

Two consequences worth stating explicitly, because both are load-bearing elsewhere:

- **Termination is unchanged.** It was never blocking that bounded the loop — `expandBranchWithFuel`
  is fuel-bounded and `maxBranches`-bounded, and both bounds are untouched. Blocking's job is to
  let a branch *reach* a verdict sooner, and it still does that, one time at a time.
- **The open certificate's saturation field is now a disjunction.** An open branch satisfies
  `findUnexpandedUnblocked … = none`, which is `findUnexpanded … = none` only when nothing is
  blocked. Any consumer that wants literal full saturation must either check for it or accept the
  blocked disjunct and argue that the ancestor's type stands in for the blocked time's.

/--
`findUnexpanded` restricted to unblocked times: the first formula that has an applicable rule

`findUnexpandedUnblocked` computing its own blocked set.

Callers that also need the blocked set — the expansion step does, for its seriality stage — should
use `findUnexpandedUnblockedWith` and share one `blockedTimes` call. `blockedTimes` is the most
expensive thing in the inner loop (a saturation test per candidate ancestor pair), and computing
it twice per expansion step is the difference between a fast corpus run and a slow one.

**Non-destructive.** No arm deletes the source formula. The `.linear` and `.branching` arms
used to (`remaining := b.filter (· != sf)`), which is what created the persistent/consumable
cycle the applied set was invented to suppress: a consumable rule would delete a formula a
persistent rule had produced, the persistent rule's `branch.contains` guard would then see
its own output missing, and the two would alternate forever. With the guards in
`findApplicableRule` covering all three arms, deletion is no longer needed to prevent
re-firing, and keeping the source buys two things: the branch is monotone, so its length is a
strict progress measure; and a time whose formulas were all consumed no longer disappears from
`Branch.knownTimes`, which is what made the ordering induced on the known times lossy.

`expandOnce` with blocked times skipped as expansion sources.

This is the step the fuel loop takes. It differs from `expandOnce` only in which formula it
picks: `findUnexpandedUnblocked` rather than `findUnexpanded`. Reporting `.saturated` therefore
means "no unblocked work remains", which is the branch-level reading of blocking that the
per-time predicate actually supports — see "Blocking Blocks a Time, Not the Branch" above.

A formula produced *at* a blocked time (the `allFuturePos` family propagates into every future
time, blocked or not) is added to the branch as usual and then skipped as a source. It is not
discarded, because the countermodel read off the branch has to describe that time too.

A single expansion step restricted to rules that introduce **no new label** — neither a fresh
world nor a fresh time.

This is the step the post-blocking pass needs. That pass exists to finish the propositional
and propagation work still outstanding on a branch that time-blocking halted, without
extending the time structure the blocking decision was made against.

Its predecessor asked `expandOnce` for *the* next step and abandoned the whole branch when
that step happened to introduce a time. That is too brittle to survive non-destructive
expansion: the source formulas now stay on the branch, so the first formula `findUnexpanded`
lands on is frequently a temporal existential, and the pass would give up with ordinary
propositional work still pending. Here the label-introducing candidates are *skipped* and the
search continues, so the pass stops only when no label-free work remains at all.

The test is exact rather than a rule list: a candidate is rejected if it mints a fresh world
(`ruleMintsFreshLabel`) or if applying it would lengthen the ordering constraints. That covers
`densityRule` and the active-mode arms of `untlNeg`/`snceNeg`, which introduce times without
being witness-guarded, and it stays correct if a future rule does the same.

## Expansion Makes Progress

The termination argument for `expandBranchWithFuel` needs to know that an `.extended` step is
not a no-op. Two facts are proved here, in increasing strength:

- `expandOnceUnblocked_length_lt` — `b.length < nb.length`. What the plan names, and a useful
  sanity check on the guards.
- `expandOnceUnblocked_adds_new` — `b ⊆ nb ∧ ∃ g ∈ nb, g ∉ b`. What the fuel bound can actually
  consume. Strict length increase does **not** bound the step count on its own: expansion is
  non-destructive, `nb = fs ++ b`, and `fs` may re-add formulas already present, so `List.length`
  has no upper bound. Set growth against the finite signed closure × label set does bound it.

Both reduce to the same question — can a rule that the guards let through return an empty
result? — and the answer is per-rule. The chain below settles it once, at the `applyRule` level,
and the two statements about `expandOnceUnblocked` then follow by destructuring its two-stage
pick.

**Tactic note, recorded because it cost four failed attempts.** `split at h` cannot see through
a `Prod.fst` projection, so the seven `if newFormulas.isEmpty then …` guards inside `applyRule`
survive `repeat' split at h` as unopened `(if c then … else …).1 = …` hypotheses, and the goal
that remains *looks* like a statement about `filterMap` because the guard that discharges it is
still sealed inside the `ite`. Interleaving `simp only [apply_ite Prod.fst] at h` opens all of
them and leaves `¬ l.isEmpty = true → l ≠ []`, which `simp` closes. No `filterMap` lemma is
needed. Relatedly, do not write the closer as `first | simp_all | <fallback>`: `simp_all` reports
success whenever it makes *any* progress, even leaving the goal open, so the fallback is
unreachable.

/-- An `.extended` step of `expandOnceUnblocked` appends a non-empty list to the branch.

The proof destructures the two-stage pick — ordinary rules first, seriality only when
`findUnexpandedUnblockedWith` returns `none` — and hands each stage to its own non-emptiness
lemma. `rw` rather than `simp` on the stage equations is deliberate: `simp` normalises
`List.contains` to `decide (· ∈ ·)`, after which the equation for the seriality stage's `find?`
no longer matches the form the `rcases` produced. -/

## The Applied Set, Demoted

The applied set existed to break the persistent/consumable cycle described in the
"Uniform Branch Guards" section. The branch guards plus non-destructive expansion break that
cycle at its source, so the applied set has nothing left to suppress, and it must not be
allowed to suppress anything: a rule filtered out by the applied set rather than by the branch
is a rule whose conclusion may be *absent* from the branch, which is exactly the orphan
situation that stopped the open-branch certificate from meaning downward saturation.

The four functions below are therefore **inert wrappers**: they ignore the `applied` argument
entirely and delegate to the guarded, non-destructive versions, always reporting an empty
applied-set delta. The signatures are kept only so that the certificate and the fuel loop can
be moved off them in a separate step; nothing depends on the applied set's contents any more,
and an open certificate's applied set is now always empty.

## What Saturation Says About Every Rule

`findUnexpanded b ord fc = none` is the engine's own certificate that a branch is finished. The
lemma below is what that certificate *means*, stated once for every rule rather than re-derived
per formula: for each rule applicable to each formula on the branch, the guard in
`findApplicableRule` that suppressed it must have held, and each guard is a statement about the
branch's contents.

This is deliberately a **mechanical unfolding lemma**, not an induction over
`expandBranchWithFuel`. That is the payoff of moving the suppression condition out of the applied
set and into `findApplicableRule`: the certificate can be read off `List.find?_eq_none` and
`List.findSome?_eq_none_iff` with no invariant to carry through the fuel loop.

The `sat_*` family in `CountermodelExtraction.lean` are its load-bearing instances; each of them
predates it and each now follows the same three steps this proof performs once.

/--
**Downward closure of saturation.** On a saturated branch, every rule applicable to every formula
present had its `findApplicableRule` guard hold, and this spells out what each guard gives:

* a `.linear` result is either wholly on the branch (ordinary rules) or its witness already exists
  (fresh-label rules);
* a `.persistent` result cannot occur at all — that arm of `findApplicableRule` carries no guard
  and returns `some` unconditionally, so a saturated branch simply has no applicable persistent
  rule (each such arm of `applyRule` filters its own output and reports `.notApplicable` instead);
* a `.branching` result has one arm wholly on the branch, or is a fresh-label rule whose witness
  already exists.
