# Countermodel Extraction from Open Tableau Branches

This module extracts finite countermodels from open (saturated) tableau branches.
When a branch saturates without closing, it describes a model that falsifies
the original formula, providing a witness for invalidity.

## Main Definitions

- `SimpleCountermodel`: Simple countermodel description (atoms true/false)
- `SemanticCountermodel`: Full semantic countermodel with world states, time domain,
  temporal ordering, and atom valuation
- `extractSimpleCountermodel`: Build simple countermodel from saturated branch
- `extractSemanticCountermodel`: Build semantic countermodel from saturated branch
- the `sat_*` family: the Hintikka conditions a saturated open branch satisfies, each read
  directly off the guard that suppressed a rule

## Two-Layer Architecture

1. **SimpleCountermodel** (Layer 0): Tracks only which atoms are true/false.
   Useful for debugging, display, and training data generation.

2. **SemanticCountermodel** (Layer 1): Full finite model with worlds, times,
   temporal ordering, and valuation. Defined directly on the branch structure
   to avoid universe level issues with the full FrameOver/WorldHistory stack.

## Where semantic correctness actually lives

**Not here.** This file extracts countermodel *data* and proves the `sat_*` Hintikka conditions;
it does not prove a truth lemma, and no longer contains a definition purporting to evaluate truth
on the extracted structure. The truth lemma is `Verified/Bridge/IntTruth.lean`'s `branchTruthAt`,
stated against the real `TaskModel`/`WorldHistory` semantics over a carrier, with
`Verified/Bridge/DenseTruth.lean` carrying it to the dense carriers.

See "Branch Truth Lemma — Retired", below, for what used to be claimed here, why it was
withdrawn, and why the recursive `branchTruth` evaluator that survived that withdrawal has now
been deleted too.

## Semantic Countermodel

A `SemanticCountermodel` captures the full finite model extracted from a
saturated open branch: world states, time domain, temporal ordering, and
atom valuation. This is the "Layer 1" (branch model) of the two-layer
countermodel approach, defined directly on the branch structure to avoid
universe level issues with the full `FrameOver`/`WorldHistory` stack.
-/

/--
A semantic countermodel extracted from a saturated open tableau branch.

Contains the finite world set, time set, temporal ordering constraints,
and atom valuation. The valuation is indexed by `(WorldIndex, TimeIndex, Atom)`
triples, matching the labeled tableau's structure.

### From vacuity to content

The saturation facts below used to be proved *vacuously*: `F(ψ → χ)` was said to be unable to
occur on a saturated branch at all, because `impNeg` "always applies" to it. That was true of
the unguarded engine, and it is exactly why the facts were worth nothing — a hypothesis no
branch can satisfy proves every conclusion.

With `findApplicableRule` branch-guarded, "no rule applies to `F(ψ → χ)`" no longer means the
formula cannot be there; it means `impNeg`'s conclusion is *already on the branch*. Each of
these lemmas is therefore now read directly off the guard that suppressed the rule, and each
now has content. The fresh-label rules are read off `witnessPresent` in the same way.
-/

/--
**Implication negative saturation**: If `F(ψ → χ)` is in a saturated branch,
then `T(ψ)` and `F(χ)` are both in the branch at the same label.

`impNeg` is linear and does not mint a label, so the only way a saturated branch can carry
`F(ψ → χ)` is for the rule to have been suppressed by its output-presence guard — which says
precisely that both conclusions are already present.

**Until positive saturation**: if `T(U(event, guard))` at `(w, t)` is on a saturated branch,
some known time carries the event witness, or carries the guard together with the Until itself —
*or* the formula is `F ⊤` and the ordering already has a strictly later time.

Both rules that can act here mint a fresh time — `someFuturePos` when `guard = ⊤` (where the
formula is `F(event)`), `untlPos` otherwise — so in both cases suppression is the witness
guard, and the witness's own label puts its time in `Branch.knownTimes`.

**The second disjunct.** Suppression is now `witnessPresent … || trivialEventWitnessed …`
(`Tableau.lean:1956-1957`). `trivialEventWitnessed` fires on exactly one shape,
`untl ⊤ ⊤` (that is, `F ⊤`), and on that shape it consults the *ordering* and not the branch: an
already-ordered strictly-later time discharges the existential obligation because `⊤` holds
there, with no witness formula needed. So on `F ⊤` the branch may carry no witness at all, and
the first disjunct is genuinely unavailable. The statement therefore gains the ordered-witness
disjunct rather than being asserted past its truth. It is not a weakening consumers cannot use:
`event = ⊤` makes the semantic witness obligation immediate at *any* time, and
`timeOrd.futureOf t ≠ []` supplies the ordered time to use.

## `sat_untl_neg` / `sat_snce_neg` — Retired with the PASSIVE arms

These two theorems said: on a saturated branch carrying `F(U(event, guard))@(w,t)` with a
non-`top` guard, **every** known future time `t'` already carries `F(event)@(w,t')` or
`F(guard)@(w,t')` — and the past-directed mirror. They are recorded as retired rather than
deleted quietly, because they did not become merely unprovable. They became **false**.

Both were read straight off the PASSIVE co-decomposition arm of `applyRule .untlNeg` /
`.snceNeg`. The derivation was: saturation forces the rule to `.notApplicable`; the only way the
old rule reached `.notApplicable` with future times present was for its `unprocessed` filter to
be empty; and the filter was empty exactly when every future time already carried one of the two
disjuncts. Each theorem's conclusion *was* that filter predicate, transcribed.

The PASSIVE arms are now retired (see the blocks inside both arms in `Tableau.lean` for the
unsoundness that forced it, the refuted alternatives, and the authorization). `.notApplicable`
is now what the rule returns on **every** configuration with a non-empty `futureTimes`/
`pastTimes`, so saturation carries no information about those times at all, and a saturated
branch may perfectly well hold a future time with neither disjunct on it. The conclusion no
longer follows and does not hold.

Nothing consumed them. A grep across the project finds their names only in prose: two orientation
comments in `Tests/BimodalTest/TemporalWitnessProbe.lean` and one in
`Verified/Bridge/TemporalGate.lean`, each contrasting the strength of these facts against the
gate rows that superseded them. All three are updated in the same commit as this retirement.

What the gate rows do instead. `untlNegFuture` (`Verified/Bridge/TemporalGate.lean`) demands
`F(event)` at every known future time of every negative `Until` — strictly stronger than the
disjunction these theorems offered, and it is a hypothesis the truth lemmas bind (`hTW`) rather
than a fact derived from a rule's guard. That is the honest place for this content: a condition
the branch is *checked* against, not one inferred from an arm that should not have existed.
-/

/-!
## Branch Truth Lemma — Retired

`branchTruthLemma` is retired rather than repaired, and the recursive `branchTruth` evaluator it
ran on — together with its only consumer, `signedTruthInModel` — is **deleted**.

The deletion is recorded rather than done silently, because the justification for the
intermediate state (keep the evaluator, retire only the lemma) turned out not to hold. That
state was defended on the ground that `branchTruth` remained "an executable debugging aid,
useful for `#eval`-inspecting what a branch claims". It was not executable: `branchTruth` is
`Prop`-valued and carries no `Decidable` instance, so
`Decidable (branchTruth cm w t f)` fails to synthesise and `#eval` was never available on it.
With that gone the definition had no remaining role — it was on no proof path, it could not be
run, and `signedTruthInModel`, its sole consumer, was itself referenced nowhere in the project.

The reason for retiring the lemma is unaffected by any of that, and is worth recording, because
the retirement is a gain rather than a loss. That lemma
proved its `imp`, `untl` and `snce` cases *vacuously*, via helper lemmas asserting that
`T(ψ → χ)`, `T(U(e,g))` and `T(S(e,g))` "cannot occur on a saturated branch at all". Those
helpers were true only of the unguarded, destructive engine, where every such formula was
consumed on sight — which is exactly why they were worthless: a case discharged by an
impossible hypothesis carries no semantic content, and three of the induction's six cases were
discharged that way.

Under the branch-guarded engine those formulas *can* sit on a saturated branch, with their
conclusions beside them, so the cases are now real. Discharging them properly is the
interpolation argument (a total valuation on a carrier, constant on the half-open intervals
between embedded branch times) plus the truth lemma built on it — mathematics of a different
order from anything in this file, and the subject of the `Verified/Bridge/` development.

What survives here, and is now non-vacuous, is the `sat_*` family above: each of those facts
is read directly off the guard that suppressed a rule, and each is a genuine Hintikka
condition the real truth lemma will consume.
