# The positive temporal witnesses, with their position kept

`CountermodelExtraction.lean`'s `sat_untl_pos` concludes

```
∃ t' ∈ b.knownTimes, T(event) @ (w,t') ∨ (T(guard) @ (w,t') ∧ T(U(event,guard)) @ (w,t'))
```

and says **nothing about where `t'` sits relative to `t`**. The truth lemma's `untl` case cannot
use that: `TruthAt … (untl φ ψ)` demands a witness strictly *after* the evaluation point, so a
witness with no recorded position is no witness at all.

The position is not missing from the argument — it is discarded from the statement. `untlPos`
mints a fresh time and is therefore suppressed only when `witnessPresent` finds one, and
`witnessPresent .untlPos` scans `timeOrd.futureOf l.time`. The existing proof obtains exactly
`⟨t', ht', hcont⟩` from that scan and then binds `ht'` to `_`, replacing it with the weaker
`mem_knownTimes_of_mem`. The two lemmas here are that same proof with `ht'` kept and reported as
`strictBefore` — the bridge's own order primitive, which is `futureOf` read as a relation
(`Bridge/BranchOrder.lean`), so no translation step is involved.

They live here rather than in `CountermodelExtraction.lean` for the reason `Bridge/
PropSaturation.lean` gives for `sat_imp_pos`: both unfold `applyRule` and so force the whole
`allRulesForFC` table to reduce, which is why they carry a raised heartbeat budget. Isolating
them keeps that budget off the engine file.

**Note on `mem_knownTimes_of_mem`.** The membership `t' ∈ b.knownTimes` is still derived from the
witness formula's own label, not from `futureOf`: `futureOf` is a closure over the *ordering*
constraints and can name a time no branch formula mentions, so the two facts are independent and
both are reported.

`t₂ ∈ futureOf t₁ → t₁ ∈ pastOf t₂` for every ordering; the `snce` witness arrives in the other
form, and the same three steps prove it — backward BFS soundness gives a constraint path,
`PathN.reverse` against the converse of `mem_directFutureOf_iff` turns it round, and forward BFS
at the same fuel finds it.

**Until positive saturation, with the witness's position kept.**

`sat_untl_pos` strengthened by the one fact its own proof already has: the witness lies strictly
after the until's own time in the branch's order.

**The ordered-witness disjunct.** Suppression is `witnessPresent … || trivialEventWitnessed …`
(`Tableau.lean:1956-1957`, `:1980-1981`). The second disjunct fires on exactly one trigger shape,
`untl ⊤ ⊤` (that is, `F ⊤`), and on it the test consults the *ordering* alone: an already-ordered
strictly-later time discharges the obligation because `⊤` holds there, so no witness formula need
be on the branch. On that shape the old conclusion — a `t'` at which the event or the guard is
literally on the branch — is false, so the statement is widened rather than asserted past its
truth.

The widening is not a claim consumers cannot use. `strictBefore timeOrd t t'` is delivered in
**both** cases and so is unconditional; what the trivial case trades away is `t' ∈ b.knownTimes`
plus branch membership, in exchange for `event = ⊤`, whose semantic obligation is immediate at
every label of every model. What is lost, and deliberately so, is `t' ∈ b.knownTimes` in the
trivial case: `futureOf` is a closure over the ordering constraints and can name a time no branch
formula mentions (see the note at the head of this file), so that membership is not available
there and is not asserted.
