# Interpolation — filling the carrier between the placed branch times

`Bridge/Carrier.lean` ends with `exists_monotone_placement`: a saturated branch's finitely many
times are placed order-faithfully at points `f i` of the carrier `D`. That is not yet a model.
`D` is `ℚ`, `ℤ` or `ℝ`; between two consecutive placed points lie points the branch says nothing
about, and `TruthAt`'s `untl`/`snce` clauses quantify over **all** of `D`, not over the placed
points. Something has to be said at every point of `D`, and it has to be said in a way that the
truth induction can survive.

This file is stage 3 of the semantic bridge (report 02 §5.2): the *interpolation*. It supplies

* the **region structure** on `D` induced by a placement — the partition of the carrier the
  placement cuts it into;
* the **extension operator** `regionExtend`, which turns any region-indexed assignment into a
  function **total on `D`**; and
* the **invariance** lemmas: truth at a point of a region agrees with truth at any other point of
  the same region, one complete lemma per formula constructor.

## The region structure: singletons and open gaps, not half-open intervals

The plan text specifies the intervals as half-open, `[d_i, d_{i+1})`. **That partition is wrong**,
and the correction is not cosmetic — it is forced by a measured counterexample, recorded here so
it is not re-attempted:

> Take `D = ℚ` with placed points `{0, 1}`, and a model constant on the half-open regions with an
> atom `p` true exactly on `[0, 1)`. Then `somePast p` is **false** at `0` (nothing below `0`
> satisfies `p`) and **true** at `1/2` (witness `1/4`). But `0` and `1/2` are half-open
> region-mates. Invariance fails.

The asymmetry is exactly the asymmetry of `[d_i, d_{i+1})`: it is closed on the left, so its least
element `d_i` has no region-mate below it, and every past-directed operator can tell `d_i` apart
from the rest of its own region. The dual failure would afflict future-directed operators under
`(d_i, d_{i+1}]`. No choice of half-open orientation works.

The partition that does work treats each placed point as **its own region** and each gap between
consecutive placed points as **an open region**:

`SameRegion f r r'` iff `r` and `r'` stand in the same order relation (`<`, `=`, `>`) to every
placed point.

The regions are then the singletons `{d_i}` together with the open intervals `(d_i, d_{i+1})` and
the two open rays. A singleton region is invariant for trivial reasons (`sameRegion_singleton`);
an open region has members on both sides of any of its members, which is precisely what the
temporal cases need. The definition is manifestly an equivalence relation, manifestly convex, and
needs neither a successor operation nor an enumeration of the placed points.

## Density is load-bearing, and `ℤ` is a genuine obstruction

"An open region has members strictly above and strictly below any of its members" is **false on
`ℤ`**: with placed points `{0, 2}` the gap `(0, 2)` is the singleton `{1}`, which is neither a
placed point nor an interval with room to move. `not_exists_gt_sameRegion_int` proves this, so the
obstruction is on record rather than a suspicion.

Consequently the temporal cases carry `[DenselyOrdered D] [NoMaxOrder D] [NoMinOrder D]`. Three of
the four frame classes are unaffected — `.Base ℚ`, `.Dense ℚ` and `.RTime ℝ` all have densely
ordered carriers with no endpoints. **`.ZTime ℤ` is not covered by these lemmas** and needs a
separate route; that is a genuine finding about the bridge's shape, not a gap in these proofs.

## "Total on `D` — never an island"

The countermodel may not be defined only at the placed points, with the rest of `D` left out of
the model: an *island* model does not refute `⊨ φ`, because `⊨ φ` quantifies over the honest
carrier. `regionExtend f g : D → W` is a genuine total function — defined at every `r : D` by
`g (regionCode f r)`, with no partiality, no `Option`, and no domain side condition — and
`region_total` records that every `r : D` really does fall in a region: a placed point, one of the
two rays, or a gap with an identified pair of endpoints.

## What the invariance lemmas quantify over

`InterpInvariant f M χ` says: for every **total** history and every pair of `SameRegion`
points, `χ` has the same truth value. The quantifier over the total histories rather than over the
single history under consideration is what makes the `box` case go through: `TruthAt … (box φ)` is
a universal over the total histories at a *fixed* time, so the induction hypothesis has to be
available at every such history simultaneously. It is available at no cost, because the atom
case's hypothesis (`RegionConstant`) is likewise imposed on every total history. `box` carries
**no accessibility relation** — `TruthAt` quantifies over totality outright — so that case is pure
transport and needs nothing from the order.

The designated admissible set is gone from the statement entirely: `TruthAt`'s remaining carrier
argument is inert and is supplied as `Set.univ`, and it no longer indexes what `box` ranges over.

## What the temporal cases turned out *not* to need

The plan anticipated the temporal cases consuming the branch saturation (`sat_*`) family. They do
not, and this is a simplification rather than a shortcut: `InterpInvariant` is a statement about
the *constructed model*, not about the branch, so it is provable from density and the region
structure alone. The branch's saturation facts are consumed one level up, by Phase 7's truth
lemma, which is where the model's values are tied to what the branch asserts. The lemma statements
here are the ones the plan specifies; only their hypothesis lists are shorter.

## Inherited constraints

The placement comes from `exists_monotone_placement`, which states monotonicity against an
explicit `(BranchOrder b ord h).le` rather than an instance-in-statement `letI` — `Fin`'s own
`instLEFin` otherwise wins. `exists_region_placement` below preserves that shape verbatim for the
same reason. Nothing here re-derives transitivity of `strictBefore` (false at fixed fuel) or
extends a partial branch order (unsound); the order used is the total one already packaged by
`Bridge/BranchOrder.lean`.

/-! ## The region structure induced by a placement

Everything in this section is about an arbitrary family `f : ι → D` of points of a linear order.
The branch enters only in the next section, where `ι` is instantiated at `BranchTime b`.
-/

section Regions

variable {ι : Type*} {D : Type} [LinearOrder D]

/--
The *code* of `r` against the placement: which placed points lie strictly below `r`, and which lie
strictly above. Two points of `D` are indistinguishable to the branch exactly when their codes
agree, so the code is the canonical name of the region containing `r`.
-/
def regionCode (f : ι → D) (r : D) : Set ι × Set ι := ({i | f i < r}, {i | r < f i})

/--
`r` and `r'` lie in the same region cut out by the placement `f`: they stand in the same order
relation to every placed point.

The regions are the singletons `{f i}` together with the open gaps between consecutive placed
points and the two open rays. See the module docstring for the measured counterexample that rules
out the half-open alternative, `sameRegion_singleton` for the placed-point case,
`sameRegion_of_gap` for the gap case, and `region_total` for exhaustiveness.

Regions are convex: anything between two points of one region is in that region.

This is what makes a region an *interval* rather than an arbitrary code class, and it is the form
the temporal cases consume — a guard verified anywhere in a region holds throughout it.

/--
A placed point is alone in its region: the singleton regions really are singletons.

This is the half of the partition that the half-open alternative got wrong — under
`[d_i, d_{i+1})` the placed point `d_i` shares its region with the whole gap above it, and every
past-directed operator can then tell it apart from its own region-mates.

/--
Two points of a common region that are actually distinct force the region to be a gap: no placed
point can then lie in it.

This is how the temporal cases discharge the side condition of `exists_gt_sameRegion` and
`exists_lt_sameRegion` — either `r = r'` and there is nothing to prove, or the region is open.

/-! ### The extension operator -/

/--
Extend a region-indexed assignment `g` to a function **total on `D`**.

Every `r : D` gets a value, unconditionally: the value `g` assigns to `r`'s region. This is the
"never an island" construction — the countermodel is defined at every point of the carrier, not
merely at the placed branch times — and `regionExtend_congr` is the sense in which it is
*constant on each region*.
-/

/--
The extension is a total function: it is defined, with a value, at every point of `D`.

Trivial by construction — recorded as a lemma because "total on `D`, never an island" is a
standing constraint on the countermodel and this is where it is discharged for the valuation.

/-! ## The measured obstruction at `ℤ`

`exists_gt_sameRegion` is not an artefact of the proof: its conclusion is genuinely false on a
discrete carrier, so the density hypothesis cannot be dropped and the `.ZTime` frame class
cannot be served by these lemmas.
-/

/--
On `ℤ` an open region can be a **singleton that is not a placed point**, so it has no member
strictly above its members.

Placement `n ↦ 2n`, point `r = 1`: the gap `(0, 2)` is `{1}`. Any `s > 1` has `2 ≤ s`, and then
`1 < 2` while `¬ (s < 2)`, so `s` is in a different region.

A history is *region-constant* for the placement `f`: it cannot tell two points of one region
apart, either in its domain or in the state it assigns.

This is the hypothesis the interpolated construction supplies — the history is built by

case of the invariance induction needs.

Quantified over all total histories rather than over one history, because `box` is a universal

such history simultaneously. No designated admissible set appears; the quantifier tracks the box

membership in a chosen set.

/-! ### Temporal cases

Both directions of both temporal constructors, for a region with room to move. The shape of every
argument is the same: a witness or a guard point that falls inside the region is transported to
the other endpoint by the induction hypothesis, and a fresh witness inside the region is produced
by `exists_gt_sameRegion` / `exists_lt_sameRegion` when the original witness has been overtaken.

**Until case.** `U(φ, ψ)` is region-invariant when `φ` and `ψ` are, on a densely ordered carrier
with no greatest element.

The open guard interval `(t, s)` is exactly what the region structure is for: any guard point that
falls inside the region is pinned by `ψ`'s invariance, and any witness that has been overtaken is
replaced by a fresh one inside the region.

formula is constant on each region cut out by the placement, provided every total history is
region-constant.

This is the whole of stage 3 of the semantic bridge: it is what lets Phase 7's truth lemma read
truth at an arbitrary point of the carrier off the branch time whose region that point is in.
