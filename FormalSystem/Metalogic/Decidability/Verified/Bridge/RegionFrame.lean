# The countermodel's frame and histories

`Bridge/Interpolate.lean` ends with a total valuation on the carrier and the statement that truth
is constant on each region cut out by the placement. This file supplies the objects that
statement is about: a frame and a family of `ConvexHistory`s, among them the *total* ones
that `Valid` quantifies over.

## What `Valid` demands, and the one constraint that is not negotiable

`FormalSystem.Semantics.Valid` reads

```
∀ D, ∀ F : FrameOver D, ∀ M, ∀ τ, τ.IsTotal → ∀ t, TruthAt M τ t φ
```

so refuting it means producing a **total** history. That is not a formality, and it decides the
shape of everything below.

### Consequence 1: totality is the whole of the demand, and it is met exactly

An arbitrary convex history is no use here: a history whose domain omits the evaluation point
carries no state there. `TruthAt … (box φ)` is a universal over the total histories at a fixed
time, so admitting partial histories would let a single one falsify `□p` outright and no branch
carrying `T(□p)` could ever be satisfied. Totality is precisely the cut that excludes them, and
it is what the box clause now quantifies over.

The fix is **totality**, not a hand-picked range. Since `regionFrame`'s task relation is the
deterministic clock (see "The frame" below), a total history is pinned by its state at time `0`:
`regionFrame_total_eq` shows every total history *is* some `regionHistory f w Δ`, and
`isTotal_iff_regionHistory` records the resulting characterization. So the frame's total-history
set `H_F` may be read either as the range the branch calls for or as the totality cut — they are
the same family, and the box clause quantifying over `H_F` costs nothing to instantiate.

This is what the earlier, maximally-permissive task relation `TaskRel s d s' := d = 0 → s = s'`
could not deliver: above zero it constrained nothing, so *any* assignment of states to all of
`D` was a legal total history and `H_F` was the full function space — strictly larger than the
intended family. Totality fixed the empty-history problem but not the junk-history problem, and
a designated admissible set had to be given as an explicit range because `H_F` was too big to
use. Determinism removes that need, and with it the designated set.

### Consequence 2: `□` is the universal modality

`timeShift_preserves_truth` turns the fixed-time universal into a universal over times as well,
with no closure side condition — totality is preserved by `timeShift` outright:

```
TruthAt M τ x (box φ) ↔ ∀ σ, σ.IsTotal → ∀ y, TruthAt M σ y φ
```

(`truthAt_box_iff` below). Truth of a boxed formula does not depend on where it is evaluated;
this is the semantic form of the perpetuity of `TM`, and it is what makes the `box` case of the
region-invariance induction *free* rather than an appeal to the induction hypothesis.

The engine agrees, which is worth recording because it is the load-bearing adequacy check for
this design: `□p → □Gp`, `□p → □□p`, `□p → G□p` and `□p → ¬◇F¬p` all close, and so do the
seriality rows `G p → F p`, `¬(Gp ∧ G¬p)`, `¬(Hp ∧ H¬p)`, `F ⊤`, `P ⊤`, while `F p → p` stays
open. See `Checks` at the bottom of this file for the fact that is cheap to state in Lean;
the closure rows are `#eval` probes against `buildTableau`.

### Consequence 3: the global `RegionConstant` hypothesis is NOT satisfiable here

`Interpolate.lean` hands `interpInvariant` over with the hypothesis
`∀ τ, τ.IsTotal → RegionConstant f τ` — every *total* history is constant on the regions of the
*fixed* placement `f`. On this carrier the total histories are exactly the region histories
(`isTotal_iff_regionHistory`), so the hypothesis ranges over the whole family and forces the
model to be trivial. The argument is short enough to state exactly:

Let `τ` be total and `r ≠ r'`. Every `timeShift τ Δ` is again total, and its state at `r` is
`τ.states (r + Δ)`. Region-constancy of *that* history at `r, r'` says: if `r` and `r'` are
region-mates then `τ.states (r + Δ) = τ.states (r' + Δ)`. Since `ι` is finite, only finitely many
`Δ` place a point of `f` between `r + Δ` and `r' + Δ`; choosing any other `Δ` makes the two
region-mates and forces `τ.states (r + Δ) = τ.states (r' + Δ)` for cofinitely many `Δ`, hence
`τ.states` constant. A history with constant states cannot separate two times, so no branch
asserting `T(p) @ t₁` and `F(p) @ t₂` in one world could be satisfied.

Under the deterministic re-host the situation is sharper still: **no** history is region-constant,
the base history included. `not_regionConstant_regionHistory` proves this for every offset, and
`not_regionConstant_regionHistory_one` keeps the concrete witness on record (`D = ℚ`, one placed
point at `0`, `Δ = 1`, region-mates `-1/2` and `-2`). A deterministic task relation propagates a
state along the clock, so a region-constant history would repeat a state at two distinct times
and be periodic, which the clock forbids.

Region-invariance therefore lives on the **valuation** rather than on histories: `M.V` factors
through `regionCode f` applied to the time component of a state. The truth induction Phase 7
runs is the **per-history** form `InterpInvariantAt` (`Bridge/TruthLemma.lean`), whose `box`
case is discharged by `truthAt_box_iff` instead of by an induction hypothesis at every history,
and whose `atom` case now takes its region hypothesis from the valuation. This is a correction
to the Phase 6 → Phase 7 interface, not a re-opening of Phase 6: every region lemma in
`Interpolate.lean` is consumed unchanged.

## The frame

`regionFrame W ι D` has states `W × D` — a branch world paired with a time — and the
deterministic clock relation `TaskRel s d s' := s.1 = s'.1 ∧ s'.2 = s.2 + d`, the structural
analogue of `multiFamTaskFrameGen` (`Metalogic/Algebraic/FlowFrame.lean`). Determinism is what
makes totality sufficient (Consequence 1 above): `respects_task` propagates the state at time
`0` along the clock, so a total history has no freedom left.

`ι` survives as a parameter of the frame without occurring in its state space, and the placement
`f : ι → D` survives as a parameter of `regionHistory` without occurring in the states. This
keeps every declaration below in the shape its consumers expect while the region structure moves
where determinism forces it to go — into the **valuation**, which reads `regionCode f`
(`Interpolate.lean`) off the time component of a state. `RegionConstant` is correspondingly no
longer provable of any history (`not_regionConstant_regionHistory`); region-invariance of atomic
truth is now a property of `M.V`, not of a history's states.

/--
The countermodel's frame: a state is a branch world together with a **time**, and the task
relation is the deterministic clock `(w, x) ⇒_d (w, x + d)` — the structural analogue of
`multiFamTaskFrameGen` (`Metalogic/Algebraic/FlowFrame.lean`).

Deterministic is deliberate, and it is a change from the earlier weakest-possible relation
`TaskRel s d s' := d = 0 → s = s'`. That relation was maximally permissive above zero, so *any*
assignment of states to all of `D` was a legal total history: the frame's total-history set
`H_F` was the full function space, strictly larger than the intended `regionHistory` family. Under
the clock relation, `respects_task` propagates the state at time `0` to every other time
(`regionFrame_total_eq`), so totality *alone* pins the history and `isTotal_iff_regionHistory`
holds.

The region structure has correspondingly moved out of the state and into the valuation: a state
no longer carries a region code, and region-invariance of atomic truth is imposed on the
valuation rather than read off the history's states. `ι` and the placement `f` are retained as
parameters throughout this file so that the declarations below keep their shape.

`[Nontrivial D]` is carried because `regionFrame_limit` requires it, via
`TaskFrame.limit_of_shift` at `pos := Prod.snd`: over a trivial duration type `0 < x` is
unsatisfiable and *Limit* (`def:frame#Limit`) has nothing to conclude from. Every consumer
elaborates at `ℤ`, `ℚ`, or `ℝ`, each of which supplies the instance.

The result is a value of the fibre over `TemporalOrder.of D` — `def:temporal-order`'s object at
the carrier `D`. The carrier stays ambient here rather than becoming a `(D : TemporalOrder)`
binder because the very same `D` is consumed as a bare type by `FrameConditionFor fc D` and by
`TemporalCarrier` in `Carrier.lean`, which are deliberately left over raw carriers.

/-! ### `regionFrame` discharges `def:frame`'s four axioms

The clock relation `s.1 = s'.1 ∧ s'.2 = s.2 + d` makes the duration of a transition recoverable
from its endpoints, via the position function `Prod.snd`. That is exactly the deterministic-shift
contract `TaskFrame.limit_of_shift` consumes, so *Limit* holds over **any** nontrivial duration
type — dense included — and every fiber is a singleton, which discharges *Saturation*.

This supersedes an earlier record flagging this frame as failing dense-polymorphically. That flag
was accurate against the frame's **former** relation, the maximally-permissive
`TaskRel s d s' := d = 0 → s = s'` described in `regionFrame`'s docstring above: above zero that
relation related every pair, so over a dense `D` every state sat in every cone of every other and
*Limit* collapsed. The relation is no longer that one. The four lemmas below elaborate at
polymorphic `D` under `[Nontrivial D]` alone, with **no** discreteness hypothesis — which is the
falsification test the flag needed, and it fails to falsify. -/

**No region history is region-constant** as soon as some region contains two distinct points —
at *any* offset, the base history `Δ = 0` included.

This is a deliberate reversal of the situation under the previous, maximally-permissive
`regionFrame`, where a state was a world paired with a region *code*, the base history's state
at `r` was the code of `r` itself, and `RegionConstant f (regionHistory f w 0)` was therefore
provable.

The reversal is forced, not incidental. A deterministic task relation propagates the state at
one time to every other time, so a history's states determine the time they are read at; a
region-constant history would have to repeat a state at two distinct times and so be periodic,
which the clock forbids. Region-invariance consequently cannot be read off a history's states
any more. It has to be imposed on the **valuation** instead — `M.V` factoring through
`regionCode f` applied to the time component of the state — which is the interface
`Bridge/Valuation.lean` and `Bridge/TruthLemma.lean` now take it from.

**The translates are not region-constant** — the concrete refutation of the Phase 6 hypothesis
`∀ τ, τ.IsTotal → RegionConstant f τ` promised in the module docstring.

One placed point at `0 : ℚ`; `-1/2` and `-2` are region-mates (both strictly below the only
placed point), but the `Δ = 1` history reads their states off the distinct times `1/2` and `-1`.
