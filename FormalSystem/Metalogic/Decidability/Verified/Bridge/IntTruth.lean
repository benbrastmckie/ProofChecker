# The signed truth correspondence: every carrier point reads one branch label

The countermodel of `Bridge/Valuation.lean` assigns a state to every point of the carrier: at a
**placed** point `f i` the branch's label `(w, timeAt b i)`, at a **gap** point the label
`Bridge/RegionLabel.lean` chose for that point's region. This file gives that assignment a name —
`stateLabel` — and runs the truth-lemma induction against it.

The induction's statement is the **signed** one, which is what a tableau branch supports:

```
BranchTruthAt b ord f φ :=
  ∀ w r, (T(φ) at stateLabel w r  →   φ true at r)
       ∧ (F(φ) at stateLabel w r  →   φ false at r)
```

Neither direction is an `iff`: a saturated branch does not decide every formula at every label,
and does not need to. Only the two implications are used, and only they are true.

## What is generic and what is not

The `atom`, `bot`, `imp` and `box` cases are proved here **for an arbitrary carrier `D` and an
arbitrary injective placement `f`**. They need nothing about gaps beyond `cutIndex_le`, which is
free, so they serve `ℚ` and `ℝ` (sub-phase 7.1d) verbatim and are not `ℤ`-specific despite this
file's name. The `untl`/`snce` cases are where `ℤ` differs from `ℚ`/`ℝ`, and they are the ones
this file leaves owed; see the section "What the temporal cases still need".

## Correction 10 — the carrier has worlds the branch never mentioned, and the model must not
notice

The total histories of this frame are `regionHistory f w Δ` ranging over **all** of `WorldIndex`,
which is `Nat`, and all time offsets. Under `regionFrame`'s task relation — the deterministic
clock `(w, x) ⇒_d (w, x + d)` — that family is *exactly* the frame's total histories
(`isTotal_iff_regionHistory`), because `respects_task` propagates the state at time `0` to every
other time. So there is no total history outside the family to worry about, and the box clause's
quantifier over total histories is a quantifier over this family.

`truthAt_box_iff_base` quantifies over exactly that range, so `T(□φ)` at a label demands `φ` at
every world of the model, including the cofinitely
many the branch never mentions. At such a world `branchPlacedVal b w i p` is
`b.hasPosAt (.atom p) ⟨w, timeAt b i⟩`, which is `false` for every atom — so a single unmentioned
world falsifies `□p` for a branch carrying `T(□p)`, and the `box` case would be unclosable.

The repair is a **world normalisation**: `normWorld b w` is `w` when the branch knows `w`, and the
branch's first known world otherwise. `normModel` reads the branch through it, so every world of
the carrier is a copy of a known one. This is a composition on the outside of `regionModel`'s
`placedVal` and `gapVal` arguments — no signature moves, `branchModel`'s `gapVal` type is
untouched, and `branchRegionVal` is consumed exactly as `Bridge/RegionLabel.lean` states it. It is
recorded as a correction rather than folded in silently because the previous four Phase 7 banners
each turned on an interface mismatch of precisely this kind that had been assumed away.

## What `findUnexpanded = none` does and does not certify

`ExpandedTableau.hasOpen` carries `findUnexpanded openBranch = none`. That reads
`findApplicableRule`, which reads `allRulesForFC`, and **`serialityRule` is deliberately outside
`allRulesForFC`** — it is scheduled by the two-stage pick, not gated by frame class. So the
certificate says "no *ordinary* rule applies", and a certified branch may still be owed
`T(F ⊤)` and `T(P ⊤)` at every one of its labels.

This costs the extracted model nothing: `F ⊤` and `P ⊤` are true at every point of every history
of any serial frame, and `ℤ` (like `ℚ` and `ℝ`) has no endpoints, so both hold everywhere in
every region history regardless of what the branch says. Every region history has total domain,
and by `isTotal_iff_regionHistory` those are all of the frame's total histories, so the argument
leaves no history the box clause can reach uncovered. But it is a genuine gap in the certificate,
and the truth lemma **names** it rather than assuming it away: no lemma below takes
`T(F ⊤) ∈ b` or `T(P ⊤) ∈ b` as a hypothesis, and none needs to.

/-! ## Branch membership, both ways

`Bridge/SubformulaProperty.lean` exports `mem_of_branch_contains`; the converse is used just as
often here (the `box` case feeds a membership fact back into the induction hypothesis, which is
stated in `hasPosAt`/`hasNegAt` form) and is not exported anywhere, so it is proved locally.

/-! ## World normalisation

See Correction 10 in the module docstring. `normWorld` is the identity on the worlds the branch
knows and lands on `anchorWorld` elsewhere, so the model has no world whose atoms the branch has
not dictated.
-/

/--
A known time's rank is a genuine region index strictly below the top one: `branchRank` counts the
known times strictly below `t`, and `t` is not one of them.

This is what lets a **placed** evaluation point reach the **upper ray**'s label through
`regionLabel_untlNeg`, whose side condition is "asserted strictly below region `j`" at `j = n`.

/--
**Box case — written first, deliberately.**

`truthAt_box_iff_base` turns `□φ` into a demand on `φ` at **every** world of the carrier and
**every** point of it, with no evaluation point left free. That is the case that machine-refuted
`GapAdequate` (`gapAdequate_insufficient`, `Bridge/Valuation.lean`), because a gap point's value at
a *compound* `φ` is not something an atom-wise policy can supply. It closes here because the two
halves of the demand are met by two facts of the same shape, both branch-fact-in and
branch-fact-out:

* at a **placed** point, `sat_box_grid_of_check` — `T(□φ)` anywhere reaches every known label;
* at a **gap** point, `regionLabel_box` — the region's chosen label carries `T(φ)` because the
  gate's box row demanded it.

Both land the induction hypothesis at a *label*, never at a gap valuation, which is the whole
content of the region-labelling decision.

The negative half needs no gate at all: `sat_box_neg` mints a known world carrying `F(φ)` at the
same time, and that time is placed, so the induction hypothesis applies at a placed point of that
world's own history.

/-! ## What the temporal cases need of the placement

Two properties, both stated **without** a `LinearOrder` instance on `BranchTime b` so that they
can appear in the case lemmas' hypotheses without a `letI` in every statement. Both are
discharged at `ℤ` in the last section, from `Bridge/Embed.lean` and `Bridge/IntGaps.lean`.
-/

/--
The placement is faithful to the branch's own order: a strict `futureOf` fact between two branch
times is a strict inequality between their carrier positions.
-/
def OrderFaithful (b : Branch) (ord : TimeOrdering) (f : BranchTime b → D) : Prop :=
  ∀ i j : BranchTime b, strictBefore ord (timeAt b i) (timeAt b j) = true → f i < f j

/--
The placement has **no inhabited interior gap**: every non-placed point is on one of the two
rays, so its region index is `0` or `n`.

True of `ℤ` under `finiteOrderEmbInt`, which is the `Nat`-cast and therefore contiguous
(`ray_of_gap_finiteOrderEmbInt`). False of `ℚ` and `ℝ`, where sub-phase 7.1d has to meet the
`G`-content from the left and the `H`-content from the right in one region state.
-/
def RayOnly (b : Branch) (f : BranchTime b → D) : Prop :=
  ∀ r : D, ¬ IsPlacedCode f (regionCode f r) →
    cutIndex (regionCode f r) = 0 ∨ cutIndex (regionCode f r) = b.knownTimes.length

/--
The placement also **reflects** the branch's order: a strict inequality between two placed points
is a strict `futureOf` fact between the times they place. The converse of `OrderFaithful`.

This is what turns the semantic "the witness sits above the evaluation point" back into a branch
fact, which is the only currency the gates trade in. It is a genuinely separate demand from
`OrderFaithful`: faithfulness alone permits a placement that spreads incomparable times apart,
and it is `timeAt`'s injectivity (`Bridge/BranchOrder.lean`) that rules out the remaining tie.
-/
def OrderReflecting (b : Branch) (ord : TimeOrdering) (f : BranchTime b → D) : Prop :=
  ∀ i j : BranchTime b, f i < f j → strictBefore ord (timeAt b i) (timeAt b j) = true

/--
Each non-placed point lies **outside** the placed block, on the side its region index names:
region `0` below every placed point, region `n` above every one.

`RayOnly` says a non-placed point's region index is `0` or `n`; this says the index is not
merely a label but a position. The temporal cases need both — the index to know which label the
point reads, and the position to know which points lie above it.
-/
def RaySplit (b : Branch) (f : BranchTime b → D) : Prop :=
  ∀ r : D, ¬ IsPlacedCode f (regionCode f r) →
    (cutIndex (regionCode f r) = 0 → ∀ i : BranchTime b, r < f i) ∧
    (cutIndex (regionCode f r) = b.knownTimes.length → ∀ i : BranchTime b, f i < r)

/--
**The carrier is stepped**: every point has an immediate successor and an immediate predecessor.

This is the resolution of the witness-existence obstruction the negative halves exposed. At an
**upper-ray** evaluation point the positive `untl` case closes by `untlRay_self` — every point
above reads the same label, so the witness is that label — but the argument silently needs *some*
`s > r` to be the witness, and a guard interval `(r,s)` it can empty. Neither `RayOnly` nor
`RaySplit` says anything about inhabitance above the upper ray, and where the temporal cases are
stated `D` is only an `AddCommGroup` + `LinearOrder`, so `r + 1` is not available. This is stated
as a property of the carrier rather than of the placement because that is all it is, and it is
discharged at `ℤ` by `r + 1` and `r - 1` (`stepped_int`).

Like `RayOnly` and `RaySplit` it is **false** at `ℚ` and `ℝ`, and like them it is used only by the
temporal cases; sub-phase 7.1d replaces all three at once with `Bridge/Interpolate.lean`'s
`exists_gt_sameRegion`/`exists_lt_sameRegion`, which supply a witness by density instead of by a
step. So this adds no restriction that was not already present.

**Contiguity, in the form the induction consumes it.** A carrier point strictly between two
placed points is itself placed.

`RayOnly` and `RaySplit` together say every non-placed point is outside the placed block, so
there is nothing left for the interior. This is the step that turns the semantics' "`ψ` at
*every* carrier point strictly between" into the branch's "`ψ` at every known time strictly
between", and it is where the `ℤ` placement differs from `ℚ` and `ℝ`: at those carriers the
interior of a gap is inhabited and `RayOnly` is false, which is why sub-phase 7.1d needs
`Bridge/Interpolate.lean`'s `exists_gt_sameRegion` in its place.

It is also what makes three of the negative case's seven leaves vacuous, in the contrapositive
form used there.

**The upper ray is upward-closed.** Everything strictly above an upper-ray point is itself on the
upper ray, and so reads the same label.

Derived rather than assumed: a point above an upper-ray point cannot be placed (`RaySplit` puts
every placed point below the ray), and cannot be on the lower ray (`RaySplit` would then put it
below every placed point, hence below the ray point itself). The `n = 0` case — no placed points
at all, so the two rays' indices coincide — is not an exception but a degeneracy, and is settled
by the two indices being equal.

/-! ## The temporal cases — LANDED, and here is what each direction runs on

All four halves are sorry-free. `branchTruthAt_untl` is `fun w r => ⟨pos w r, neg w r⟩`, and
likewise for `snce`; splitting the theorem before proving any of it is what let the two directions
stop depending on each other, and neither has since needed anything the other proved.

### The design decisions that survived, and the two that did not

1. **`sat_untl_pos` discards the ordering.** `Bridge/TemporalSaturation.lean`'s
   `sat_untl_pos_future` and `sat_snce_pos_past` keep the witness's position. In the event they
   are **not called**: row 7 keeps the witness in the guard-`⊤` case too, which is the only place
   the older design needed them.
2. **The witness has to be the *earliest* one — dropped.** No earliest-witness iteration appears
   anywhere. Row 7 hands back a witness *together with* the guard below it, so the branch does the
   minimisation once, decidably, instead of the proof redoing it. This is what the row shapes were
   measured for and it is why the placed leaf is six lines.
3. **The ray self-demand.** `untlRaySelf`/`snceRaySelf` (rows 3 and 4) close the leaf where the
   evaluation point looks along its own ray, `untl` upward and `snce` downward.
4. **Region invariance is unavailable at `ℤ`** — unchanged, and it is why the rays are handled a
   point at a time. `interpInvariantAt` needs `DenselyOrdered D`, and
   `not_exists_gt_sameRegion_int` is the machine witness that `exists_gt_sameRegion` genuinely
   fails here.

### The `⊤` trap, which governed the design and still does

`Tests/BimodalTest/TemporalWitnessProbe.lean` refutes any row asking the branch to *assert* a
guard on nine of twelve rows, **including rows with no genuine until in them**: the guard of a
`someFuture` is `⊤` and the engine never writes `T(⊤)`. So `ψ = ⊤` splits off at every leaf and is
discharged semantically — `⊤` is true at every point of every model. What the positive halves
changed is *where* the exemption sits: rows 7 and 9 exempt `ψ = ⊤` from the **guard** only and
keep the witness, because `TruthAt … (untl ⊤ φ)` still demands one. A row exempting itself
entirely there asserts nothing on the whole `someFuture`/`somePast` fragment.

### The negative case tree

Four live leaves and three vacuous ones. Write `r` for the evaluation point and `s` for the
witness the semantics hands back, so `r < s`.

* `r` **placed**, `s` **placed** — `OrderReflecting` turns `f i < f j` back into a `strictBefore`
  fact and `untlNeg_spread` denies `φ` there.
* `r` **placed**, `s` on the **upper ray** — `s` reads `regionLabel … n`, and `regionLabel_untlNeg`
  reaches it, its "strictly below region `j`" side condition being `branchRank_lt_length`.
* `r` **placed**, `s` on the **lower ray** — vacuous: `RaySplit` puts `s` below `r`.
* `r` on the **lower ray** — one leaf for all three shapes of `s`, and that is exactly the reach of
  row 5, `untlNegRay_low`, because every label any point reads is a known time.
* `r` on the **upper ray** — `s` placed and `s` on the lower ray are vacuous; `s` on the upper ray
  reads `r`'s own label and `regionLabel_untlNeg` closes it against itself.

### The positive case tree, and the obstruction it exposed

Three live leaves, one row each, and no vacuous ones — the positive direction chooses its witness
rather than being handed one, so nothing is ruled out for it.

* `r` **placed** — row 7. `isPlacedCode_of_between` makes every carrier point of the guard interval
  placed and `OrderReflecting` reads its time back as strictly between, which is the row's reach.
* `r` on the **lower ray** (`untl`; the **upper** ray for `snce`) — row 9, Correction 12's residual.
  The reach has to be all of `b.knownTimes`: the interval holds placed points below the witness
  *and* ray points reading the evaluation point's own label, and `regionLabel` picks the first
  eligible candidate rather than the order-minimal one.
* `r` on the **upper ray** (`untl`; the **lower** ray for `snce`) — `untlRay_self`, plus `Stepped`.

That last leaf is where the design was incomplete and the incompleteness was invisible until the
negative halves were written. "The guard interval is empty" needs *some* `s > r` to be empty
between, and neither `RayOnly` nor `RaySplit` says anything about inhabitance above the upper ray.
`Stepped` is the minimal repair; `upperRay_of_gt` and `lowerRay_of_lt` supply the other half of
that leaf — that every point above an upper-ray point reads the ray's label — and they are
**derived** from `RayOnly` and `RaySplit` rather than assumed.

### What the positive halves do not need

Neither positive half references `branchOrderValid`, the frame class, `findUnexpanded`,
`findClosure`, `timeOrderTotal`, `boxAnchoredCheck`, `regionLabelCheck` or the non-empty-worlds
hypothesis. The positive direction is carried by the placement geometry and rows 3, 7, 9 and 10
alone. The negative direction is where `regionLabelCheck` is load-bearing.

None of the above touches an engine file, the region labelling, or any interface already landed.
-/

/--
**Until case, negative half.** `F(U(φ,ψ))` at a point's label makes `U(φ,ψ)` false there.

No guard reasoning appears: `untlNeg_spread` denies the *event* at every known later time
outright, which is strictly more than the semantics asks for and is what makes this half
independent of the `⊤` trap that governs the positive one.

**Until case, positive half.** `T(U(φ,ψ))` at a point's label makes `U(φ,ψ)` true there.

Three leaves, and the guard is read off a different row at each.

* `r` **placed** — row 7 (`untlPos_witness`) hands back a known time `t'` strictly after `r`'s own
  carrying `T(φ)`, and the guard at every known time strictly between. `OrderFaithful` puts the
  witness above `r`; `isPlacedCode_of_between` makes every carrier point of the guard interval
  placed and `OrderReflecting` reads its time back as strictly between, which is exactly the row's
  reach.
* `r` on the **lower ray** — row 9 (`untlRayDn_witness`), Correction 12's residual. The witness may
  be *any* known time, since every placed point is above `r`; the guard interval contains placed
  points below the witness *and* lower-ray points reading `r`'s own label, so the row has to carry
  the guard at both, which is why its reach is `b.knownTimes` rather than a slice.
* `r` on the **upper ray** — `untlRay_self` gives `T(φ)` at the label, `upperRay_of_gt` says every
  point above reads that same label, and `Stepped`'s successor supplies a witness with an empty
  guard interval. Without `Stepped` there is no witness to hand back at all: this leaf is where
  the property earns its place.

`ψ = ⊤` splits off at every leaf and is discharged semantically — `⊤` is true at every point of
every model, and the engine never writes `T(⊤)`, so no row may ask for it. Rows 7 and 9 keep the
witness in that case and drop only the guard.

/-! ## The assembled induction

`Formula` has exactly six constructors — `atom`, `bot`, `imp`, `box`, `untl`, `snce`. There are
no `G`/`H`/`F`/`P` constructors: `allFuture φ` is `(untl ⊤ φ.neg).neg`, so every temporal
universal lands on the `untl`/`snce` cases through `imp`.

/-! ## The `ℤ` instantiation

`Valid` (`Semantics/Validity.lean`) quantifies over every carrier, so **one** carrier refutes it,
and `ℤ` under `finiteOrderEmbInt` is the one whose interior gaps are empty. The placement is
instantiated **directly**, not through `exists_monotone_placement`: that returns an existential
and discards the contiguity, which is the only thing `ℤ` has going for it.

/--
The placement is monotone for the **packaged** branch order.

Stated with the packaged order's `le` written out rather than as `≤`, deliberately, and routed
through `RelEmbedding.map_rel_iff` rather than `OrderEmbedding.monotone`. `BranchTime b` is an
`abbrev` for `Fin n`, so bare `i ≤ j` resolves to `Fin`'s own instance and not to
`BranchOrder b ord hV`, and a `letI` does not displace it; separately, the `LE` instance
`finiteOrderEmbInt` carries reaches `LinearOrder` through `DistribLattice` where `Monotone`
reaches it through `Preorder`, and the two paths are defeq but not syntactically equal, so
unification against a metavariable fails. `map_rel_iff` has no instance arguments at all — the
relations come from the embedding's own type — so neither trap can fire. Every consumer goes
through this lemma.

/-- **Order faithfulness at `ℤ`**: a `futureOf` fact is a strict `branchLT` fact
(`lt_of_strictBefore`), hence a `≤` fact whose two sides are distinct, and the placement is
injective. -/

/-- **Order reflection at `ℤ`**: the converse of `orderFaithful_intPlace`.

The packaged order's totality leaves three cases at two known times. Comparability the right way
round is the conclusion; the wrong way round contradicts faithfulness; and *equality of the two
times* is where `timeAt_injective` earns its keep — it collapses the two indices, and a point is
not strictly below itself. -/

/-- **The rays sit outside the placed block at `ℤ`.** `ray_of_gap_finiteOrderEmbInt` puts a
non-placed integer strictly below `0` or at-or-above `n`, and the placement is exactly `0, …,
n-1`. The two cross terms are vacuous rather than false: a point below `0` has region index `0`,
so demanding that its index be `n` forces `n = 0`, and then there is no placed point to compare
it with. -/

/-! ### Headline result 1, at `ℤ`

The hypothesis bundle is the open-branch certificate plus the three decidable branch gates.
`findUnexpanded … = none` is the `hasOpen` field verbatim, and it means "no **ordinary** rule
applies" — `serialityRule` is outside `allRulesForFC`, so the branch may still be owed
`T(F ⊤)`/`T(P ⊤)` at every label. Neither this theorem nor anything it calls consumes those, and
both are true at every point of the `ℤ` countermodel regardless.

**`not_valid_of_hasOpen`, at `ℤ`.** A saturated open branch denying `χ` at one of its labels
refutes `Valid χ`.

The countermodel is `normModel b ord (intPlace b ord hV)` over `regionFrame WorldIndex
(BranchTime b) ℤ`, and the base history of
the denying label's own world as the falsifying history.
