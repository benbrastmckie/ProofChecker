# The Branch Order — a finite linear order out of a saturated branch

The semantic bridge needs the times a saturated open branch talks about to carry a genuine
**linear** order, because the countermodel is built by embedding those times monotonically into
a carrier `D` (`Bridge/Carrier.lean`, `Bridge/Embed.lean`) and interpolating between them.
What the engine hands over instead is `TimeOrdering` — a *list of strict constraints* — plus the
decidable gate `timeOrderTotal` saying no two branch times are left incomparable.

This file closes that gap: from one decidable Bool gate on `(b, ord)` it packages
`LinearOrder (BranchTime b)` where `BranchTime b := Fin b.knownTimes.length`.

## Why the gate is three conditions and not one

`timeOrderTotal` alone is **not** enough, and the reason is worth stating because it is easy to
assume otherwise.

`LinearOrder` needs reflexivity, transitivity, antisymmetry and totality. `timeOrderTotal`
delivers only the last. The other two order-theoretic obligations are about the *relation*
`strictBefore ord t₁ t₂ := (ord.futureOf t₁).contains t₂`, and neither is free:

* **Transitivity is not free** because `TimeOrdering.futureOf` is a *fuel-bounded* breadth-first
  search (`SignedFormula.lean`, default `fuel := 100`). At any fixed fuel there is a constraint
  list on which it under-reports: a chain longer than the fuel has `t₂ ∈ futureOf t₁` and
  `t₃ ∈ futureOf t₂` while `t₃ ∉ futureOf t₁`. So "`futureOf` is a transitive closure, hence
  transitive" is false as stated about the function the engine actually calls. Do not attempt to
  prove `strictBefore` transitive outright — it is not a theorem.
* **Antisymmetry is not free** because the constraint list can be cyclic. `addFuture` never
  checks for cycles, and `identifyTime` drops only the constraints that collapse to `(t,t)`, not
  longer cycles it may create. On a cyclic list `futureOf` reports both `t₁ ∈ futureOf t₂` and
  `t₂ ∈ futureOf t₁`, which is exactly the antisymmetry failure.

Both are, however, **decidable on the finitely many branch times**, and that is the route taken
here: `branchOrderValid` conjoins `timeOrderTotal` with an irreflexivity check and a cubic
transitivity check, all quantified over `b.knownTimes`. It is one `Bool`, so a certificate can
carry it exactly the way `timeOrderTotal` was designed to be carried, and the calculus-side work
that makes it come out `true` (the order-level branching rule) is unchanged in kind: one more
conjunct to flip, measured the same way.

## Indexing: why `Fin b.knownTimes.length` is the right index type

The plan left a choice open — index over the times occurring in `ord.constraints` **union**
`b.knownTimes`, or over `b.knownTimes` alone. `b.knownTimes` alone is correct, and it is correct
*because of* non-destructive expansion:

Pre-2.5 the engine's destructive expansion could consume every formula sitting at a time, and
that time then vanished from `knownTimes` even though `ord.constraints` still mentioned it. The
measured symptom (report 04 §Q2.2) was `constraints = [(0,2),(0,1)]` with `knownTimes = [2,1]`:
the order *induced on the known times* was empty, so `timeOrderTotal` read `false` for a branch
whose real order was perfectly total, and the union indexing was the natural repair. 2.5's
non-destructive expansion removed the cause — the root's formulas are kept, hence so is the root
time — so `knownTimes` is now closed under "mentioned by a live constraint" for the constraints
that matter, and the simple indexing is faithful. Indexing over the union would additionally
force the bridge to invent semantic content for times carrying no formulas, which the truth
lemma has nothing to say about.

## SETTLED: blocking semantics is identification/deletion, never edge-addition

Recorded here because this is the file whose order the unwinding of blocked loops has to respect
(plan constraint 4, and the consumer is Phase 7.1's loop-unwinding argument).

When the engine blocks a time `t_new` against an earlier `t_anc`, the branch is **not** repaired
by adding an ordering edge between them. It is repaired by *identifying* the two instants —
`Branch.identifyTime` relabels everything at `src` to `tgt`, and `TimeOrdering.identifyTime`
substitutes `src := tgt` throughout the constraint list, dropping constraints that collapse to
`(t,t)`. `src` then disappears from `knownTimes` entirely.

The reason edge-addition is excluded is structural, not stylistic: `TimeOrdering` is a list of
**strict** `<` pairs and has no way to express `t_new = t_anc`. An added edge would assert one of
`t_new < t_anc` / `t_anc < t_new`, both of which are strictly stronger than what blocking
established and both of which are unsound in the direction that matters — the branch recorded
that the two instants are indistinguishable, not that they are ordered. Dropping `(t,t)` is part
of the same decision: `(t,t)` asserts `t < t`, which `futureOf` propagates into a spurious cycle
making every time reachable from every other, and `branchOrderValid` would then read `true` for
a branch whose order is inconsistent (the irreflexivity conjunct is precisely the guard against
this).

The consequence relied on downstream: **identification shrinks `knownTimes`**, so the creation
index of the identified time strictly decreases, and (since 2.6's `blockCandidates` made blocking
bidirectional, a time being blockable only by one created strictly earlier) the unwinding
argument has a well-founded measure in both directions.

## Non-goal, explicitly: no linear extension of a partial branch order

Do **not** attempt to repair a `false` gate by taking the branch's partial order and extending it
to a linear one — Mathlib's `extend_partialOrder` / `LinearExtension`. It is **unsound**, with a
measured counterexample (report 04 §Q2.3, and the same argument is recorded at `timeOrderTotal`'s
own docstring in `Saturation.lean`):

In `¬(F(G p) ∧ F(¬p))` the two incomparable sibling times carry `T(G p)` and `F(p)`. The
extension that places the `G p` time first forces `p` true exactly where the branch asserts
`F(p)`; the other extension does not. The formula is satisfiable, so **exactly one** of the two
extensions is a model — and nothing on the branch records which. The calculus has to branch on
the order; the model construction cannot choose it afterwards. The identical argument kills
"propagate universals to incomparable times" as a repair.

This is why `branchOrderValid` is a **gate consumed as a hypothesis**, never a theorem proved
about arbitrary branches.

/--
`t₂` lies strictly after `t₁` in the branch's abstract time order.

This is `TimeOrdering.futureOf` read as a relation. It is the *only* order primitive the bridge
consumes, deliberately: `futureOf` is already the transitive-closure-shaped reading the temporal
rules use (`allFuturePos` and friends), so the model built from it agrees with the rules that
produced the branch.

def orderIrrefl (b : Branch) (ord : TimeOrdering) : Bool :=
  b.knownTimes.all fun t => !strictBefore ord t t

/--
`strictBefore` is transitive *on the branch times*.

Quantified over `b.knownTimes` only, which is what makes it decidable (cubically many checks in
the number of branch times) and what makes it honest: `strictBefore` is not transitive in
general, because `futureOf` is fuel-bounded. See the module docstring.

/--
The single decidable gate the bridge consumes: the branch's times carry a strict linear order.

Conjunction of `timeOrderTotal` (delivered by the order-level branching rule) with the two
order-theoretic conditions that `timeOrderTotal` does not imply. Carried on an open-branch
certificate exactly as `timeOrderTotal` is.

/-! ## The order relation -/

/--
The strict branch order on indices.

The `timeAt b i = timeAt b j ∧ i < j` disjunct is an index-level tiebreak. On a real branch it
never fires, because `Branch.knownTimes` is built by `eraseDups` and so lists each time once;
carrying the tiebreak anyway means trichotomy and irreflexivity hold **unconditionally** in the
index, with no `List.Nodup` side condition to thread through every downstream lemma. The
resulting order is the same one in every case that arises.

The packaged order is built from this *strict* relation rather than from a `≤` directly, via
`linearOrderOfSTO`: that hands back the `min`/`max`/`compare`/`lt` plumbing already discharged,
where a hand-rolled `LinearOrder` literal with an opaque `le` field cannot synthesise the `rfl`
defaults for those fields.
