# O3: the modal-temporal saturation facts

`CountermodelExtraction.lean` supplies `sat_box_pos`: `T(□φ) @ (w,t)` on a saturated branch puts
`T(φ)` at `(w', t)` for **every known world** `w'`, at the *same* time. The `box` case of the truth
lemma needs more than that, because `truthAt_box_iff_base` (`Bridge/RegionFrame.lean`) makes `□` the
universal modality over *both* coordinates: every world **and** every point of the carrier.

This file adds the three facts that the same saturation hypothesis does yield, kept in a separate
module because each unfolds `applyRule` and so forces the whole `allRulesForFC` table to reduce —
the reason `sat_box_pos` carries `maxHeartbeats 1600000`. Isolating them means a heartbeat or
memory failure here cannot take down `Bridge/Valuation.lean` or anything else already green.

* `sat_box_temporal` — `T(□φ) @ l` puts `T(G φ) @ l` and `T(H φ) @ l` on the branch. This is the
  `boxTemporal` rule (`Tableau.lean:635`), sound by `boxToFuture`/`boxToPast`, and it is the
  lemma the Phase 7 handoff names as missing.
* `sat_all_future_pos` / `sat_all_past_pos` — `T(G φ) @ (w,t)` puts `T(φ)` at every `t'` in
  `timeOrd.futureOf t`, and dually for `H`.
* `sat_box_cross` — the composition: `T(□φ) @ (w,t)` reaches every label that differs from `(w,t)`
  in **at most one** coordinate.

## What is still missing, stated exactly

`sat_box_cross` is a *cross*, not a grid. It does not reach a label `(w', t')` differing in both
coordinates, and no strengthening of the saturation hypothesis will make it: `boxPos` emits
`T(φ)`, never `T(□φ)`, so there is nothing at `(w', t)` to run `boxTemporal` on.

The engine nevertheless closes `□p → □Gp`, `□p → □□p`, `□p → G□p` and `□p → ¬◇F¬p`, and the
mechanism is visible in `Tableau.lean`: the label-minting rules copy the box/diamond context to
the label they mint (`boxDiamondPersistence`, `Tableau.lean:434`, which appears in the output of
six rules). So "`T(□φ)` is present at every known label" is a **branch invariant established at
rule-application time**, not a consequence of `findUnexpanded = none`. `BoxContextClosed` below
names that invariant; discharging it is an induction over tableau construction, not over the rule
table, and it is the form the truth lemma's `box` case should consume.

`boxTemporal` is persistent and emits `[T(Gφ), T(Hφ)]` filtered against the branch, returning
`.notApplicable` exactly when nothing new remains — so on a saturated branch both conclusions are
already present. Sound by `boxToFuture` (`□φ → Gφ`) and `boxToPast` (`□φ → Hφ`).

/--
**The residual invariant, named.** The truth lemma's `box` case needs `T(□φ)` at *every* known
label, not merely at the one it was found on — that is what turns `sat_box_cross` from a cross
into the full grid, via one further application of `sat_box_pos` at each time.

It is not a saturation fact. `boxPos` emits `T(φ)`, never `T(□φ)`, so no rule table argument can
produce it. It is established when labels are *minted*: `boxDiamondPersistence`
(`Tableau.lean:434`) copies the world's box/diamond context onto every freshly minted time, and
the world-minting rules copy it onto every freshly minted world. Discharging `BoxContextClosed`
is therefore an induction over tableau construction.

anywhere puts `T(φ)` at every known label — the exact hypothesis

/-! ## `BoxContextClosed` is the wrong invariant, and this is why

`BoxContextClosed` was named as the residual on the strength of `boxDiamondPersistence`
(`Tableau.lean:434`). Reading the six call sites settles that it is **not** what the construction
maintains, on two independent counts. Both are recorded below as theorems about the engine's own
definitions rather than as prose.

1. *Time-minting copies the box context only at one world-time.* Every call site passes
   `boxDiamondPersistence branch l.world l.time freshTime`, and that function reads
   `branch.boxPosAtWorldTime l.world l.time` — the `T(□B)` sitting at the *triggering* label, not
   at every label. A `T(□φ)` at a different world is not copied to the fresh time.
2. *World-minting does not copy box formulas at all — it copies their contents.* `boxNeg` and
   `diamondPos` (`Tableau.lean:535`, `:577`) run `branch.boxPosFormulas.filterMap` with the arm
   `| .box inner => SignedFormula.pos inner { world := freshWorld, time := bsf.label.time }`, so
   the fresh world receives `T(B)`, never `T(□B)`. `BoxContextClosed` therefore fails at the
   first minted world whenever any `T(□φ)` is on the branch — which is exactly the case it was
   introduced to serve.

Nor does saturation repair the gap: the fresh-label rules are suppressed by `witnessPresent`
(`Tableau.lean:1670`), whose test for `boxNeg`/`diamondPos` is the *witness* alone — `F(ψ)` (resp.
`T(ψ)`) at some known world. The auto-propagation outputs are outside the test, so a saturated
branch is under no obligation to carry them.

What the truth lemma actually needs is not `T(□φ)` everywhere but `T(φ)` everywhere, and the
weakest branch fact that delivers it — given saturation, which already supplies `boxPos`,
`boxTemporal`, `allFuturePos` and `allPastPos` — is that the *temporal* consequences of a box
formula are present at every known world at the box formula's own time. That is
`BoxTemporalSpread`, and it is strictly weaker than `BoxContextClosed`
(`boxTemporalSpread_of_boxContextClosed`).

/-! ## The invariant the construction really maintains -/

/--
**The temporal spread of a box formula across worlds.** `T(□φ)` anywhere puts `T(Gφ)` and `T(Hφ)`
at *every known world*, at the box formula's own time.

**Historical note — this is no longer maintained by the engine, and the sentence that follows
describes a removed mechanism.** `boxNeg`/`diamondPos` used to copy
`branch.allFuturePosAtTime l.time` and `branch.allPastPosAtTime l.time` — the `T(G·)` and `T(H·)`
formulas at the triggering time, at every world — onto the fresh world, and combined with
`boxTemporal` that was read as the invariant form of "the box context follows the label". Those
six copy blocks (per rule) were **removed as unsound**: `T(Gφ)` asserts that `φ` holds along the
history currently being built, which is exactly the thing `□`/`◇` quantify over and therefore
exactly what may not be assumed of a freshly minted alternative world.

The refutation recorded below already showed `BoxTemporalSpread` false on real engine output
*before* that removal, for an unrelated reason (later time-minting), so the removal does not
change this definition's status: it was not maintained then and is not maintained now. The
definition is kept because `boxAnchored_of_boxTemporalSpread` still routes through it and it
documents the invariant that was tried and rejected.

It is strictly weaker than `BoxContextClosed`, and it is not what the truth lemma consumes; see
`BoxAnchored` below.

**Nothing is lost by the weakening.** On a saturated branch `BoxContextClosed` implies
`BoxTemporalSpread`: transport the box formula to `(w', l.time)` and run `boxTemporal` there.

/-! ## Totality of the induced ordering, in both directions

`Saturation.timeOrderTotal` compares two known times using `futureOf` **only**: `t₁ = t₂`, or
`t₂ ∈ futureOf t₁`, or `t₁ ∈ futureOf t₂`. `sat_all_past_pos` consumes `pastOf`. Bridging the two
needs the converse law for the transitive closures, which is `TimeOrderConverse` below.

At the one-step level the converse is immediate and is proved here: `directFutureOf` and
`directPastOf` are the two projections of the *same* constraint list
(`mem_directFutureOf_iff_mem_constraints` / `mem_directPastOf_iff_mem_constraints`). Lifting it
through `reachableForward`/`reachableBackward` is a fuel-bounded breadth-first-search duality —
forward and backward shortest-path depths agree, so equal fuel suffices.

**That lifting is done, and `TimeOrderConverse` is no longer an assumption.** It is not proved
again here: `Verified/Termination/Fuel.lean` already carries it as `orderDual_holds`, for *every*
`TimeOrdering`, via the `open private reachableForward reachableBackward` route plus the shared
breadth-first shape `bfsClosure` (`bfsClosure_sound` for the forward half, `PathN.reverse` for the
edge-by-edge reversal, `bfsClosure_complete` and the `BfsInv` visited-set invariant for the
backward half). `OrderDual` and `TimeOrderConverse` are the same statement, so `timeOrderConverse`
below is a rename, and the consumers' `hConv` hypotheses are now dischargeable at every call site.
The two names are kept apart because the fuel module reaches the closure duality for a termination
purpose (`timeChain_of_linearity_saturated`) that has nothing to do with the box grid.

/-! ## `BoxTemporalSpread` is refuted, and `BoxAnchored` replaces it

**`BoxTemporalSpread` is not a fact about saturated branches, and so is not available as a
construction invariant either.** It was adopted on the strength of the world-minting copy
(`boxNeg`/`diamondPos` copy `branch.allFuturePosAtTime l.time` and `branch.allPastPosAtTime
l.time` onto the fresh world, `Tableau.lean:553-559`), and that reading of the copy is correct as
far as it goes. What it misses is that the copy happens at **one** time — the *triggering* label's
`l.time` — while the box formula it is supposed to serve does not stay at one time. The
time-minting rules run `boxDiamondPersistence branch l.world l.time freshTime`, which relabels
`T(□φ)` from `(w, t)` to `(w, freshTime)`; so a single `T(□φ)` on the seed branch becomes a
`T(□φ)` at *every* time the run mints in that world, and `BoxTemporalSpread` then demands `T(Gφ)`
at the fresh world at every one of those times, of which the mint supplied exactly one.

The refutation is measured, not argued, and on a formula that is in no way exotic. Running the
engine on `(□p ∧ ◇q) → r` at `.Base` (fuel `200`) yields an OPEN saturated branch over 2 worlds
and 7 times on which `boxTemporalSpreadCheck` is `false` — note that the world here is minted at
the *same* time as the box formula, so the failure is not the cross-time-mint case one would
guess at; it is the persistence of `T(□φ)` into times minted later. `(□p ∧ ◇(G q)) → r` and
`(□p ∧ ◇q) → r` at `.Dense` fail the same way. See `Tests/BimodalTest/BoxSpreadProbe.lean` for
the rows.

`boxAnchoredCheck` was `true`, and `boxGridCheck` `true`, on every one of those branches at the
time that measurement was taken. That was the corrected invariant: what the fresh world needs is
not `T(Gφ)`/`T(Hφ)` at every time the box formula reaches, but **one anchor time** carrying
`T(φ)`, `T(Gφ)` and `T(Hφ)` together. The mint used to supply exactly that: `boxProps` gave the
content at the box formula's own time, and the `tempGProps`/`tempHProps` blocks gave `G` and `H`
at the minting time.

**Those two blocks have since been removed as unsound** (see the historical note on
`BoxTemporalSpread` above). They were the *only* route by which `T(Gφ)`/`T(Hφ)` could reach a
freshly minted world: `boxProps` supplies only `T(inner)`; `boxTemporal` fires only on `T(□·)`,
which never reaches a fresh world; `allFuturePos`/`allPastPos` require `T(G·)`/`T(H·)` to be
present already. `boxAnchoredCheck` is therefore expected to compute `false` on multi-world
branches now, and the anchor half of the argument above no longer holds on real engine output.

**Nothing breaks at typecheck.** `BoxAnchored` and `boxAnchoredCheck` are still well-formed, and
every lemma below that takes `hBA : boxAnchoredCheck b = true` carries it as a hypothesis and
never unfolds it. What is lost is that the hypothesis is no longer dischargeable by computing on
a branch the engine actually built, so the truth lemma's `box` case loses a side condition it
could previously establish by `decide`. Repairing that — by propagating `T(□φ)` itself to the
fresh world, by copying `T(Gφ)`/`T(Hφ)` only when box-derived, or by restructuring the `box` case
so it does not need an anchor — is a design decision about the saturation strategy with its own
soundness obligations, and it is deliberately left open here rather than settled by reinstating
an unsound copy. The measurement, the full carrier list and the repair options are written up in
`specs/418_.../artifacts/boxanchored-finding.md`; the second half of the `timeOrderTotal`
argument (every known time is comparable to the anchor, so `sat_all_future_pos` and
`sat_all_past_pos` sweep the world's whole row from a single anchor) is unaffected and remains
correct *given* an anchor.

/--
**The anchored box spread.** For every `T(□φ)` on the branch and every known world `w'`, *some*
known time `s` carries `T(φ)`, `T(Gφ)` and `T(Hφ)` together at `w'`.

This is the corrected replacement for `BoxTemporalSpread`. The two differences are exactly the
two the refutation above forces: the time is **existential** rather than pinned to the box
formula's own `l.time`, and the content `T(φ)` is demanded alongside `T(Gφ)`/`T(Hφ)` (the `t' = s`
case of the trichotomy has no `G`/`H` to appeal to, since `G` and `H` are strict).

/--
**Nothing is lost by the correction.** On a saturated branch `BoxTemporalSpread` implies
`BoxAnchored`, with the box formula's own time as the anchor and `sat_box_pos` supplying the
content. The converse fails — that is the content of the refutation — so `BoxAnchored` is
strictly weaker, and it is the one that survives contact with the engine.

/-! ### The invariant and the grid in decidable form

Stated as `Bool`-valued checks so the refutation is re-runnable against the engine's own output
rather than only assertable in prose. `Tests/BimodalTest/BoxSpreadProbe.lean` holds the rows;
they live there and not here because each row runs `buildTableau`, which is far too slow to sit
on a library module's build path.

        b.knownTimes.all fun t' => b.contains (SignedFormula.pos inner ⟨w', t'⟩)
    | _ => true

/-! ### The check discharges the invariant

**`BoxAnchored` does not need an induction over tableau construction, and should not get one.**
`timeOrderTotal` — the other branch-level side condition the grid consumes — is *not* proved
invariant under expansion anywhere in this development. It is a decidable check on the finished
branch, carried as a hypothesis `hTot : timeOrderTotal b timeOrd = true` and discharged per run
by computation. `BoxAnchored` has exactly the same character: it is a first-order condition on a
finite branch, decidable in the branch, and the truth lemma only ever needs it for the *one*
saturated branch `hasOpen` hands back.

`boxAnchored_of_check` is that route. It turns the residual obligation from "prove an induction
over `expandOnceUnblocked` covering every rule in `allRulesForFC`, including the two that mint
worlds and the six that mint times" into "evaluate a `Bool` on the branch in hand" — which the
probe rows already do, and which `Decidable (⊨ φ)` can do at instance-resolution time. A
construction-level proof would be a strictly stronger result and is worth having; it is not on
the critical path for the truth lemma, and treating it as if it were is what cost the previous
two dispatches.

/-! ## The grid, from the corrected invariant -/

/--
**The grid, from the anchor.** `T(□φ)` reaches every known label — the exact hypothesis
`truthAt_box_iff_base` consumes — on a saturated branch whose ordering is total, given
`BoxAnchored`.

The three cases of `knownTime_trichotomy`, taken about the *anchor* `s` rather than about the box
formula's own time:

* `t' = s` — the anchor's own content `T(φ) @ (w', s)`.
* `t' ∈ futureOf s` — `T(Gφ) @ (w', s)` and `sat_all_future_pos`.
* `t' ∈ pastOf s` — `T(Hφ) @ (w', s)` and `sat_all_past_pos`.

`TimeOrderConverse` is no longer a hypothesis here: `timeOrderConverse` discharges it. Note that,
as with `sat_box_grid`, no case needs `T(□φ)` anywhere other than where it was found.

**Status of the hypothesis.** `BoxAnchored` *was* an invariant the engine's output satisfied, on
the strength of the world-minting rules' `tempGProps`/`tempHProps` blocks. Those blocks have been
removed as unsound, and they were the only route by which `T(Gφ)`/`T(Hφ)` could reach a freshly
minted world, so `BoxAnchored` is no longer supplied by the construction on multi-world branches.
This lemma is unaffected as a lemma — it takes `BoxAnchored` as a hypothesis and proves the grid
from it — but a caller can no longer expect to discharge that hypothesis from a real run. See
`specs/418_.../artifacts/boxanchored-finding.md`.

**The grid with both side conditions in decidable form** — the shape the truth lemma consumes.

Both hypotheses are now `Bool` equations on the finished branch, matching how `timeOrderTotal`
was already handled, so a caller holding a concrete open branch discharges them by computation
rather than by a construction-level invariant.

**`T(□φ)` reaches every known label** — the exact hypothesis `truthAt_box_iff_base` consumes, and
the replacement for `sat_box_all_labels` that rests on an invariant the construction can actually
supply.

The three cases of `knownTime_trichotomy`, at an arbitrary known world `w'`:

* `t' = t` — `boxPos` at the box formula's own label already reaches every known world.
* `t' ∈ futureOf t` — `BoxTemporalSpread` puts `T(Gφ) @ (w', t)` on the branch, and
  `sat_all_future_pos` discharges it at `t'`.
* `t' ∈ pastOf t` — the mirror, through `T(Hφ) @ (w', t)` and `sat_all_past_pos`.

Note that no case needs `T(□φ)` anywhere other than where it was found.
