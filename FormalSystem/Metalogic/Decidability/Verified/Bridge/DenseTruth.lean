# The truth correspondence at a dense carrier

`Bridge/IntTruth.lean` runs the signed truth-lemma induction at `ℤ`, where the placement
`finiteOrderEmbInt` is contiguous and so has **no inhabited interior gap**. This file is
sub-phase 7.1d: the same induction at `ℚ` and `ℝ`, where interior gaps *are* inhabited and the
three geometry hypotheses `ℤ` supplied — `RayOnly`, `RaySplit` and `Stepped` — are all false.

## What carries over verbatim, and why that is a theorem rather than a hope

The `atom`, `bot`, `imp` and `box` cases of `IntTruth.lean` are stated for an **arbitrary**
carrier `D` and an **arbitrary** injective placement `f`. Nothing in them mentions `ℤ`, gaps, or
rays: they need only `cutIndex_le`, which is free. They are therefore consumed here unchanged,
and `branchTruthAt_of_temporal` below is the machine-checked statement of exactly that claim —
the whole six-case induction, with the two temporal cases abstracted into hypotheses and the
other four discharged by the landed `ℤ`-file lemmas.

Isolating the assembly this way is the same move that converged the temporal cases at `ℤ`: split
before proving. It has two payoffs. It makes the *only* difference between the discrete and dense
milestones explicit and finite — two hypotheses — so a reader can see at a glance that 7.1d owes
the temporal cases and nothing else. And it means the dense side never restates
`BranchTruthAt`, `stateLabel`, `normModel`, or any of the four non-temporal cases, which is what
the Phase 7 register requires.

## Why the temporal cases genuinely do not carry over

At `ℤ` a non-placed point lies on one of the two rays (`RayOnly`), so the induction never meets
an inhabited interior gap, and `isPlacedCode_of_between` turns the semantics' "at every carrier
point strictly between" into the branch's "at every known time strictly between". At `ℚ` and `ℝ`
that step is simply false: between two consecutive placed points there is a whole interval of
carrier points, none of them placed, all reading one region label.

The replacement is `Bridge/Interpolate.lean`'s `exists_gt_sameRegion` / `exists_lt_sameRegion`,
which supply a witness **by density** where `Stepped` supplied one by a step, together with
`SameRegion` and the invariance induction — a region's points are indistinguishable, so a witness
may be moved within its region. `not_exists_gt_sameRegion_int` is the machine witness that this
route is unavailable at `ℤ`, which is why the two milestones are separate sub-phases rather than
one lemma with a disjunction in it.

/-! ## The assembly, with the temporal cases abstracted

`Formula` has exactly six constructors — `atom`, `bot`, `imp`, `box`, `untl`, `snce`. There are
no `G`/`H`/`F`/`P` constructors: `allFuture φ` is `(untl ⊤ φ.neg).neg`, so every temporal
universal lands on the `untl`/`snce` cases through `imp`.

/--
**The truth-lemma induction, generic in the carrier and in the two temporal cases.**

The four non-temporal cases are discharged here, once, from `Bridge/IntTruth.lean`'s
carrier-generic lemmas. The `untl` and `snce` cases are hypotheses, because they are the only two
that distinguish a contiguous placement from a dense one.

`IntTruth.branchTruthAt` is the discrete instance of this (it predates the split and is left
exactly as it landed); the dense milestone is the other instance.

Note which gates appear and which do not: `branchOrderValid` and `temporalWitnessCheck` are
**absent**, because none of the four non-temporal cases consumes either. They re-enter through
whatever discharges `hUntl`/`hSnce`.

/-! ## Rank and cut index are the same count

`branchRank b ord t` counts the branch's known times strictly before `t`, in the **branch**
order, as a `List.filter` length. `cutIndex (regionCode f s)` counts the placed points strictly
below `s`, in the **carrier** order, as a `Finset.card`. The dense negative temporal case needs
to compare the two, because `regionLabel_untlNeg` reaches region `j` from a label of rank
`< j` — and the region a witness sits in is named by its cut index.

This is stated for an arbitrary carrier, and is the piece the discrete milestone never needed:
at `ℤ` a witness in a gap is on a ray, so `j` was always `0` or `n` and `branchRank_lt_length`
settled the side condition without any comparison of counts.
-/

section Counting

/--
Counting over `Fin n` by list filter and by `Finset` filter agree.

`Finset.univ` on `Fin n` is `List.finRange n` with a nodup proof attached, so this is definitional
once both sides are unfolded to a multiset length; it is stated separately because the unfolding
is what a caller would otherwise have to repeat.
-/

**`branchRank`, counted over the index type instead of over the list.**

`b.knownTimes` is the image of `timeAt b` over all of `BranchTime b`
(`List.map_getElem_finRange`), so filtering the list and filtering the index type count the same
elements. No injectivity is needed here: the list and the index type are in definitional
bijection, not merely in bijection.

**A placed point's rank is strictly below the cut index of anything above it.**

This is the side condition of `regionLabel_untlNeg` (`Bridge/RegionLabel.lean`), supplied for an
arbitrary region rather than only for the top one, and it is what lets the dense negative `untl`
case treat an interior gap and the upper ray as **one** leaf: both are non-placed points, both
read `regionLabel b ord w (cutIndex (regionCode f s))`, and the reaching lemma is `j`-generic.
At `ℤ` this collapses — `RayOnly` forces `j ∈ {0, n}` — which is exactly why the discrete
milestone got by with `branchRank_lt_length` instead.

The count is strict for a reason worth naming: `i` itself is below `s` and so is counted on the
right, while `strictBefore` is irreflexive on a gated branch and so does not count `i` on the
left. Everything else transfers by `OrderFaithful` alone.

Free of every gate and of the branch order: `{i | f i < r} ⊆ {i | f i < s}` when `r < s`, and the

evaluation point and the witness are non-placed — the leaf `ℤ` never had, because `RayOnly`
forbids two distinct inhabited regions strictly between placed points.

The companion of `branchRank_lt_cutIndex` and its exact converse in force: that one says a placed

`r` has rank at least `r`'s. Together they make `j ≤ branchRank b ord v` the faithful branch-side
reading of "`v`'s placed point lies above every point of region `j`", which is what row 5's first
reach is stated in.

Note which direction of the placement each needs: `branchRank_lt_cutIndex` runs on
`OrderFaithful`, this one on `OrderReflecting`. The inequality is non-strict here because no
element separates the two counts — `r` is not placed, so nothing is gained at the boundary.

/-! ## The two negative temporal halves, at a dense carrier

`ℤ`'s negative halves are seven leaves apiece, three of them vacuous by `RaySplit`. The dense ones
are **four leaves and none vacuous**, which is fewer rather than more, and the reason is the
`j`-genericity of `regionLabel_untlNeg`: a non-placed point reads
`regionLabel … (cutIndex (regionCode f s))` whether it sits in an interior gap or on a ray, so the
case split is simply *placed or not*, twice, with no ray analysis anywhere. `RayOnly`, `RaySplit`
and `isPlacedCode_of_between` do not appear.

What replaces the ray analysis is arithmetic on the cut index, and all four side conditions are
instances of the three counting lemmas above:

| leaf | reaching lemma | side condition |
|------|----------------|----------------|
| `r` placed, `s` placed | `untlNeg_spread` | `OrderReflecting` |
| `r` placed, `s` not | `regionLabel_untlNeg` | `branchRank_lt_cutIndex` |
| `r` not, `s` placed | `untlNegRegion_up` | `cutIndex_le_branchRank` |
| `r` not, `s` not | `untlNegRegion_label` | `cutIndex_mono` |

The bottom two rows are what row 5's generalisation bought, and the fourth is the one `ℤ` could
not state at all.

/-! ## The two positive temporal halves, at a dense carrier

The positive halves are where the discrete and dense milestones differ most, and the difference is
one word: at `ℤ` the upper-ray leaf **vanishes** its guard interval — `Stepped` supplies an
immediate successor, so there is nothing strictly between the point and its witness — while at
`ℚ`/`ℝ` no point has a successor and the interval is always inhabited. The guard therefore has to
be *carried across a whole region* instead, which is precisely the demand row 11's `self` disjunct
makes and no `ℤ` row ever did.

`exists_gt_sameRegion` supplies the witness `Stepped` used to, and `sameRegion_convex` does the
work `upperRay_of_gt` did: everything between a point and a region-mate above it is another
region-mate, so it reads the same label and the single guard fact at that label covers the whole
interval. `RayOnly`, `RaySplit`, `Stepped`, `upperRay_of_gt` and `isPlacedCode_of_between` are all
absent.

The **placed** leaf is the one place a landed row is consumed for the first time:
`regionLabel_untlGuard` — `Bridge/RegionLabel.lean`'s straddling guard — closes the sub-leaf where
the guard interval of a placed-to-placed witness meets a non-placed point. `ℤ` never called it
because contiguity made that sub-leaf empty (`isPlacedCode_of_between`). It is worth naming that
this costs **nothing** in gate strength: `untlGuards` is already a row of `regionLabelCheck`, so
consuming it adds no obligation that sub-phase 7.3 did not already carry.

/-! ## The assembled induction, and the `ℚ`/`ℝ` instantiation

The assembly is `branchTruthAt_of_temporal` with the four halves above plugged in — one line per
operator, no second induction, which is what isolating the assembly first bought.

For the instantiation the placement is the `ℤ` one **cast**, not a new construction. Everything
the temporal cases ask of a placement (`Function.Injective`, `OrderFaithful`, `OrderReflecting`)
transports along any strictly monotone map, and `Int.cast` into an ordered field is one. What does
*not* transport — and what makes this a separate milestone rather than a corollary — is
`RayOnly`/`RaySplit`/`Stepped`: the cast image of a contiguous block is not contiguous in `ℚ`,
which is exactly the content of `not_exists_gt_sameRegion_int` read the other way round.

Stated once and applied twice, because the `ℚ` and `ℝ` headline results differ only in which
binder list the validity predicate carries — the model, the placement and the truth lemma are the
