# The branching propositional rule, on a saturated branch

`CountermodelExtraction.lean` proves the `sat_*` family for every rule the truth lemma's induction
consumes **except one**: `impPos`. That is not an oversight about a minor case — `imp` is the only
primitive propositional connective besides `bot`, so the truth lemma's `imp` case has no
saturation fact to run on without it, whatever the gap policy turns out to be.

It is missing because `impPos` is the only *branching* rule among the propositional ones, and the
existing family is written against `.linear` and `.persistent` arms. `findApplicableRule`'s
`.branching` arm reads

```
if ruleSelfGuarded rule then some …
else if ruleMintsFreshLabel rule then (if witnessPresent … then none else some …)
else if bss.any (fun fs => fs.all branch.contains) then none
else some …
```

and `impPos` is neither self-guarded nor fresh-label-minting, so the only way it can fail to be
applicable is the third test: **some arm of the split is already wholly on the branch**. For
`T(ψ → χ)` the arms are `[F(ψ)]` and `[T(χ)]`, so that test is exactly the disjunction
`F(ψ) ∈ b ∨ T(χ) ∈ b` — the classical `impPos` reading of a saturated open branch.

`sat_imp_pos` below states and proves it. It lives here rather than in
`CountermodelExtraction.lean` for the reason `BoxSaturation.lean` gives for its own contents: the
proof unfolds `applyRule` and needs `maxHeartbeats 1600000`, and an elaboration timeout in an
engine-adjacent file would take the whole green prefix down with it.

## Relation to the gap refutation

Nothing here depends on the gap policy, and the gap policy's refutation
(`Bridge/Valuation.lean`, `not_truthLemma_branchGapVal`) does not touch this: the `imp` case of the
truth lemma needs `sat_imp_pos` at *placed* labels, where the branch dictates the valuation
outright and no gap point is involved.

**`impPos` saturation.** `T(ψ → χ)` at a label on a saturated branch puts `F(ψ)` or `T(χ)` at that
same label.

The disjunction is not a case split the proof performs — it is what the `.branching` guard
literally says: `findApplicableRule` declines `impPos` exactly when *some* arm of its split is
already wholly contained in the branch, and its two arms are the singletons `[F(ψ)]` and `[T(χ)]`.

Sound by the material reading of `→`: any model of the branch satisfies `ψ → χ` at the label, so
it falsifies `ψ` or satisfies `χ` there.
