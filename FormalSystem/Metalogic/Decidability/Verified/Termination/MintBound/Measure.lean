/-! # C7. The measure, and the figure it earns

The concrete measure the abstract induction is instantiated at, its three residuals, and the
**divergence in the fuel figure** the instantiation forced.

## The measure, and why each of its three components is there

    Ψ(σ, b, ord) = 2·(Tmax² + 1)·mintPotential + extensionAllowance + splitOrderedRank

* `splitOrderedRank` is the ordered dimension, landed and unmodified. It strictly drops at **all
  three** arms of an ordered split (`expandOnceUnblocked_splitOrdered_rank_lt`), which is the only
  thing that moves at arms 1 and 2 — there the branch is literally unchanged.
* `extensionAllowance` is the branch dimension, and it is **not** `|U| − |b|`. That plain form is
  what the recorded obstruction refutes: `Branch.identifyTime` shrinks the branch and hands
  universe budget *back*, so `|U| − |b|` rises at arm 3. The allowance carries the shrinkage the
  run may still be owed — `|U| + (|knownTimes| + mintPotential)·|U| − |b|` — which is exactly the
  counting chain's links 2 and 3 turned into a per-state quantity: at most one identification per
  unit of `|knownTimes| + mintPotential`, and at most `|U|` of shrinkage each. Every arm-3 step
  spends one unit of that allowance to buy back at most `|U|`, so the allowance never rises.
* `mintPotential` is the fourth component, weighted by `2·(Tmax² + 1)`, and it is what breaks the
  circularity. A mint raises `|knownTimes|` and therefore raises the rank; nothing in the branch
  dimension can pay for that without re-opening the recorded circularity, and the mint potential
  can, because it is bounded by `8·|U|` outright and strictly drops at every mint. The weight is
  exactly twice the rank's per-time step, which is what makes one mint's drop dominate one mint's
  rank rise with a unit to spare.

## DIVERGENCE, recorded: `splitAwareFuel` is short, and by how much

Phase-level check `path_le_splitPathBound` compares the assembled counting figure against
`splitPathBound` and it fits — but what it bounds is `#extensions + #identifications`, **not the
total number of engine steps**. Fuel is spent by every step, including the ordered split's arms 1
and 2, which change neither the branch nor its known times and are therefore counted by neither
summand. `splitPathBound Ucard Tmax = (Ucard + 1)·(orderedRunBound Tmax + 1)` budgets one full
ordered run per branch-growing step and allows `Ucard + 1` of those; the measure above admits up
to `Ucard + Tmax·Ucard` branch-growing steps (shrinkage refunds) and up to `8·Ucard` rank resets
(mints), and neither is inside that figure.

The derived figure `mintPathBound` is therefore `splitPathBound` **plus** the three ceilings the
measure actually needs, and `splitPathBound_le_mintPathBound` /
`splitAwareFuel_le_mintAwareFuel` record that this is an *enlargement*: nothing that held at the
landed figure is withdrawn, and the landed figure is not redefined. This follows plan 02's own
instruction for `orderedRunBound` — derive the value, use the derived one, record the divergence —
rather than quietly restating the target at a figure that was not checked.

## Three residuals, named and not absorbed

`UniverseClosed`, `DifficultyBounded` and `MintPaysForTime` below are hypotheses of the theorem,
never of `mintPotential` or of the engine. Each carries its own docstring saying what would
discharge it and what stands in the way. -/

/-- **The ordered split's rank drop, at engine level.** `splitOrderedRank_lt_of_timeLinearity` is
stated at `applyRule .timeLinearity`; this is the same content read off
`expandOnceUnblocked_splitOrdered_shape`, so the induction never has to reach past the engine step
into the pick stages. All three arms drop: arms 1-2 by `incompPairs_lt_addFuture`, arm 3 because a
retired time is worth more than the whole incomparable-pair range. -/

/-- **The identification allowance.** Known times plus remaining mints: an upper bound on how many
identifications the run can still perform, because each identification retires a known time and
only a mint can create one. This is the counting chain's link 1 as a per-state quantity. -/

    (b : Branch) (ord : TimeOrdering) : Nat :=
  b.knownTimes.toFinset.card + mintPotential U σ b ord

/-- **The branch-growing allowance**, carrying the shrinkage the run may still be owed.

`|U| − |b|` alone is refuted as a measure by the identification arm; this is that quantity plus
`|U|` for each identification still available, which is links 2 and 3 of the counting chain read
per-state. It never rises: an identification spends one unit of `mintTimeBudget` (worth `|U|`) to
buy back at most `|U|` of branch. -/
def extensionAllowance (U : Finset SignedFormula) (σ : SignedFormula → SignedFormula)
    (b : Branch) (ord : TimeOrdering) : Nat :=

/-- **The carried state**: the run invariant, confinement to the universe, and the derived time
bound. The third clause is what `derivedTmax_spec` satisfies at the engine's seed, so it is a
consequence of the mint budget rather than an assumption about `Tmax`. -/

/-- **The forward direction of `mem_signedUniverse`.**

`mem_signedUniverse` is the `mpr` direction only: it builds membership from a formula fact and a
label fact. Every closure argument about `signedUniverse C L` needs the converse — given a member,
recover its two coordinates — because closure conditions are stated on `C` and `L`, not on the
image.

It lives here rather than beside `mem_signedUniverse` because `Fuel.lean` is frozen: its md5 is
pinned by the plan that landed the totality terminus, so no new declaration may be added to it. -/
theorem formula_label_of_mem_signedUniverse {C : Finset Formula} {L : Finset Label}
    {x : SignedFormula} (h : x ∈ signedUniverse C L) : x.formula ∈ C ∧ x.label ∈ L := by
  simp only [signedUniverse, Finset.mem_image, Finset.mem_product, Finset.mem_insert,
    Finset.mem_singleton] at h
  obtain ⟨p, ⟨-, hf, hl⟩, rfl⟩ := h
  exact ⟨hf, hl⟩

/-- **Residual 1: the universe is closed under the engine's steps.**

The unsplit totality theorem carries the same obligation, as the conjunction of its `P` and its
`hU`; here it is separated out and named because the second clause is genuinely new. An ordered
split's identification arm **relabels** the branch, so confinement is preserved only if `U` is
closed under merging one time into another.

**Clause 2 as written is false at every nonempty `U`.** `universeClosed_identify_retime_false` is
the refuting witness and `universeClosed_nonempty_false` the residual-level corollary; the cause in
one line is that the merge *target* `t₁` is universally quantified with nothing tying it to `b`, so
a `Finset` universe would have to contain a distinct retiming of one of its own members at every one
of infinitely many times. It is not a statement about `L` that a caller could discharge: no `C`, no
`L` and no frame class enters the refutation. `universeClosed_identify_empty` shows the clause does
hold at `U = ∅`, so its satisfiability set is exactly `{∅}` — satisfiable only where the terminus is
vacuous.

It is retained **verbatim, unweakened**, because the landed terminus is stated against it and
nothing in this file is withdrawn. The satisfiable replacement is `UniverseClosedAt`, which
restricts `t₁` — and only `t₁` — to `b.knownTimes`;
`universeClosedAt_of_universeClosed` records that the replacement is *weaker*, hence that every
theorem restated against it is a strengthening. The restriction leaks no new hypothesis into the
terminus, because every consumer of clause 2 reaches `t₁` through
`expandOnceUnblocked_splitOrdered_shape`, whose trigger spec `firstIncomparablePair_spec` already
returns `t₁ ∈ b.knownTimes`. Register entries 10 and 12 record the refutation and the
tempting-but-wrong repair.

**Clause 1 is a different matter, and its label dimension is *not* a caller's obligation about `L`
either** — see `universeClosed_fresh_world_escapes` and the discussion on
`unorderedSuccessor_confined_signedUniverse_of_headroom`. An earlier version of this docstring said
that for `U = signedUniverse C L` the whole definition "is a statement about `L`". That is right for
clause 2's repaired form (`timeMergeClosed_identifyTime_signedUniverse` supplies the condition) and
**wrong** for clause 1's label dimension, which no closure condition on a fixed finite `L` can
supply. -/
def UniverseClosed (fc : FormalSystem.ProofSystem.FrameClass) (U : Finset SignedFormula) : Prop :=
  (∀ (b : Branch) (ord : TimeOrdering) (tr : EventualityTracker), (∀ x ∈ b, x ∈ U) →
      ∀ nb ∈ unorderedSuccessorBranches (expandOnceUnblocked b ord fc tr).1, ∀ x ∈ nb, x ∈ U) ∧
  (∀ (b : Branch) (t₁ t₂ : TimeIndex), (∀ x ∈ b, x ∈ U) →
      ∀ x ∈ b.identifyTime t₂ t₁, x ∈ U)

/-- **Residual 2: the per-arm difficulty coefficient.**

`D` is the interface `splitAwareFuel` already documents. An earlier version of this docstring
blamed the `private` markers on `temporalCount`/`modalCount` in `Saturation.lean` for the bound
being unstatable here. **That explanation is wrong**, and the correction matters because it points
a reader at the wrong file. `private` blocks *name resolution*, not *unfolding*:
`simp only [estimateBranchDifficulty]` reduces across the module boundary and leaves the two
counters as opaque non-negative terms, over which `omega` reasons freely
(`estimateBranchDifficulty_length_le`) and against which a lemma with universally quantified
counters unifies (`estimateBranchDifficulty_le_of_subperm`). Widening the two markers would
therefore change nothing, which is why `Saturation.lean` is deliberately left untouched.

**The real obstruction is list multiplicity.** `estimateBranchDifficulty` is
`1 + 3·tempCount + 2·modCount + len/4`, and both the counters and the `len/4` term are computed
over the branch **list** — `Branch` is `List SignedFormula` (`SignedFormula.lean:240`), not a
finite set. Every confinement fact in this development, `∀ x ∈ b, x ∈ U` included, is a statement
about `b.toFinset`, and **nothing in the repository asserts a branch is `Nodup`**: successors are
built as raw `formulas ++ b` with no `eraseDups` (`Tableau.lean:2233-2239`), and avoiding a `Nodup`
side condition was a deliberate design goal (`BranchOrder.lean:275-290`). A `U`-confined branch may
therefore be arbitrarily long, so no fixed `D` bounds `estimateBranchDifficulty` on it. The
statement below is consequently **false at every `D`** at any `U` the engine fires on —
`difficultyBounded_multiplicity_false` is the refuting witness, and register entry 9 records it.

It is retained verbatim, unweakened, because the landed terminus is stated against it and nothing
in this file is withdrawn. The satisfiable replacement is `StepLengthBounded`, which is provably
equivalent to it up to a factor of `4` (`difficultyBounded_of_stepLengthBounded` and
`stepLengthBounded_of_difficultyBounded`), and `buildTableauAt_isSome_of_lengthBudget` is the
sibling terminus stated at that shape. -/
def DifficultyBounded (fc : FormalSystem.ProofSystem.FrameClass) (U : Finset SignedFormula)
    (D : Nat) : Prop :=
  ∀ (b : Branch) (ord : TimeOrdering) (tr : EventualityTracker), (∀ x ∈ b, x ∈ U) →
    (∀ nb ∈ unorderedSuccessorBranches (expandOnceUnblocked b ord fc tr).1,
        estimateBranchDifficulty nb ≤ D) ∧
    (∀ bs, (expandOnceUnblocked b ord fc tr).1 = ExpansionResult.splitOrdered bs →
        ∀ p ∈ bs, estimateBranchDifficulty p.1 ≤ D)

/-- **Residual 3: a step that creates a time is a step that mints.**

The one genuinely open mathematical obligation of this development, and the two things standing in
its way are named here rather than glossed.

*The first disjunct* — a step that does not raise the known-time count does not raise the rank —
is refuted for at least three rules if read as "non-`ruleMintsFreshLabel` implies no new time":
`densityRule` interpolates a fresh time and is deliberately **absent** from `ruleMintsFreshLabel`
(it carries its own `existingIntermediates` guard instead), and the active-mode arms of
`untlNeg`/`snceNeg` introduce times without being witness-guarded. `expandOnceNoFresh` rejects
exactly those three by testing `newOrd.constraints.length` rather than the rule list, which is the
in-repo evidence that the rule-list reading is the wrong one. So the disjunct is about the
*ordering-length* test, not about `ruleMintsFreshLabel`, and establishing it means a time-dimension
analogue of `applyRule_emitted_world_mem`.

*The second disjunct* is where the once-only bound is cashed, and it carries the **σ-hit**
obligation `mintPotential_lt_of_pick_linear` / `_branching` state in their hypotheses: the formula
the rule fires on must be `σ sf` for some `sf ∈ U`. As the section note on time reuse records, that
is a question about whether the engine can re-issue a time an earlier identification retired —
`Branch.nextTime` is `maxTime + 1` and `Branch.identifyTime` can *lower* `maxTime` — and the
equivalent live-times reformulation carries the identical obligation, which is what shows it is
intrinsic to the situation rather than an artifact of this measure. It is **not** discharged here.
It is a hypothesis, it is named, and nothing in this file assumes it.

**Both of those have since been settled, and this predicate is retained verbatim anyway.** Section
D1 lands the time-dimension analogue the first disjunct asked for —
`applyRule_emitted_time_mem`, `applyRule_emitted_time_dichotomy`,
`unorderedSuccessor_time_dichotomy` and the quantitative
`knownTimes_card_le_succ_of_unorderedSuccessor` — and the rule census `freshTimeRules` that the
disjunct's rule-list reading got wrong. Section D2 settles the rest, negatively:

* the predicate **as stated is false**, at every frame class and every `Tmax`
  (`mintPaysForTime_untlNeg_false`), satisfiable only at `U = ∅` (`mintPaysForTime_empty`);
* the σ-hit obligation is **false**, not merely open: the engine really does re-issue a retired
  time on a run (`nextTime_reissues_retired_time`, `reuse_driven_through_engine`) and nothing minted
  there lies in the renaming's image (`mint_not_in_rhoSF_image`);
* neither of the two obvious repairs is available — re-indexing the potential on `freshTimeRules`
  (`witnessPresent_eq_false_of_not_freshLabel`) nor dropping disjunct 1's cardinality conjunct
  (`splitOrderedRank_lt_of_knownTimes_lt`, `mintPaysForTime_rank_repair_false`).

So this remains the development's one open mathematical obligation, but it is now open at a
*located* obstruction rather than an unexamined one: what is missing is a measure component paying
for the three self-guarded minting rules that also survives the identification arm. See section
D2's blocked-repair note for the full statement.

**And it is open only on the temporal fragment.** Section D3 proves this predicate — the one stated
here, at every `σ`, not a repair of it — for every universe whose formulas carry no `untl` and no
`snce` node (`mintPaysForTime_of_untlSnceFree`), at every frame class and every `Tmax`, and hence at
the concrete `signedUniverse C L` the seed-level termini consume. Every step there lands in the
first disjunct, so neither the σ-hit nor the self-guard measure is consulted, and `densityRule` is
excluded by its own shape gate rather than by a frame-class restriction. What is open is the
predicate at a universe containing a temporal operator, which `mintPaysForTime_untlNeg_false`
confirms is where the difficulty actually lives. -/

          mintPotential U σ nb (expandOnceUnblocked b ord fc tr).2
            < mintPotential U σ b ord)

/-! ### `UniverseClosed`'s identification clause is refutable, at every nonempty `U`

The same shape of defect that `difficultyBounded_multiplicity_false` records for `DifficultyBounded`,
in a different coordinate. There the quantifier that went unconstrained was the branch's *length*;
here it is the identification's **merge target**.

Clause 2 reads `∀ (b : Branch) (t₁ t₂ : TimeIndex), (∀ x ∈ b, x ∈ U) → ∀ x ∈ b.identifyTime t₂ t₁,
x ∈ U`, and `t₁` — the time everything is merged *into* — ranges over all of `TimeIndex` with
nothing tying it to `b`, to `U`, or to any ordering. Since `Branch.identifyTime b t₂ t₁` is
`(b.map fun sf => if sf.label.time == t₂ then {sf with label := {sf.label with time := t₁}} else
sf).eraseDups`, the singleton branch `[x]` at `t₂ = x.label.time` retimes `x` to `t₁` outright.
Clause 2 then demands the retiming of `x` at **every** `t : TimeIndex`, and `t ↦ ⟨x.sign, x.formula,
⟨x.label.world, t⟩⟩` is injective, so `U` would have to be infinite. It is a `Finset`.

So the clause is satisfiable only where the terminus is vacuous: `universeClosed_identify_empty`
records that it does hold at `U = ∅`, and `universeClosed_nonempty_false` records that this is the
only case. No frame class enters either statement.

The repaired form is `UniverseClosedAt` below, which constrains `t₁` — and only `t₁` — to
`b.knownTimes`. Register entries 10 and 12 record the refutation and the tempting-but-wrong repair.
-/

/-- **The refutation.** Clause 2 of `UniverseClosed`, stated as a standalone proposition so the
witness does not have to carry clause 1, is false at every nonempty `U` — with no frame-class
hypothesis, because none is needed.

The universe is a `Finset`; the clause forces it to contain a distinct retiming of one of its own
members at every one of infinitely many times. The pigeonhole is taken over
`Finset.range (U.card + 1)`, which is the smallest range that cannot inject. -/

/-- **The residual as literally stated is unsatisfiable wherever it matters.** Projecting the second
conjunct and applying `universeClosed_identify_retime_false`.

This is the exact analogue of `difficultyBounded_multiplicity_false` for the other residual: the
hypothesis is not merely unproved, it is false, and it is false for a reason that no amount of work
on `C`, on `L`, or on the frame class can repair. -/

/-- **The complement that makes the refutation informative.** Clause 2 *does* hold at `U = ∅`,
vacuously: confinement to the empty universe forces `b = []`, and `[].identifyTime t₂ t₁ = []`.

Together with `universeClosed_nonempty_false` this pins the residual's satisfiability set exactly:
`{∅}`. A residual satisfiable only at the empty universe is satisfiable only where the terminus it
guards has nothing to say, since `signedUniverse C L` is empty only when `C` or `L` is. -/

/-! ### The difficulty toolkit, and the scope decision it settles

`DifficultyBounded` is the one residual whose docstring used to misdescribe its own obstruction,
and the toolkit here is what settles the question. Two routes were open:

* **(a)** widen `temporalCount`/`modalCount` in `Saturation.lean` so a formula-complexity bound
  becomes *nameable* here;
* **(b)** bound `estimateBranchDifficulty` using only what is already reachable from this file.

**(b) is taken, and (a) is neither necessary nor sufficient.** Not necessary, because
`estimateBranchDifficulty_length_le` below is a bound on `estimateBranchDifficulty` proved in this
file, right now, with the counters `private`: `simp only [estimateBranchDifficulty]` unfolds across
the module boundary and leaves the two counters as opaque `Nat`-valued terms that no source text
here can *name* but that `omega` handles like any other non-negative unknown. Upper bounds transfer
the same way, by unification against a lemma whose counters are universally quantified — that is
`estimateBranchDifficulty_le_of_subperm`. Not sufficient, because the obstruction is **list
multiplicity**, not visibility: see `DifficultyBounded`'s docstring and
`difficultyBounded_multiplicity_false`. Making the counters public would leave the residual exactly
as unprovable as it is. `Saturation.lean` is therefore not edited.

What the toolkit delivers instead is the honest maximum: a lower bound in the branch's **length**,
monotonicity of the difficulty under sub-permutation, and a concrete ceiling `difficultyCeiling U L`
that any `U`-confined branch of length at most `L` respects. Together with the equivalence in the
next block, these say that the coefficient `D` the fuel allocation consumes is, up to a factor of
`4`, a bound on branch length and nothing about formula complexity at all. -/

/-- **The difficulty is at least the branch's length, quartered.**

The lemma that retires the visibility framing of the `DifficultyBounded` residual. Its proof is
`simp only [estimateBranchDifficulty]; omega` — the unfolding crosses the `Saturation.lean`
boundary even though `temporalCount` and `modalCount` are `private` there, because `private`
governs which names this file may *write*, not which definitions the elaborator may *unfold*. What
`omega` sees after the `simp only` is `1 + 3 * ?t + 2 * ?m + b.length / 4` with the two counters
opaque non-negative terms, and dropping two non-negative summands is all the bound needs.

Read in the contrapositive this is the whole content of the multiplicity obstruction: a bound
`estimateBranchDifficulty b ≤ D` *forces* `b.length ≤ 4 * D`, so a residual asserting the former
for every `U`-confined `b` is asserting a bound on branch length in disguise. -/

/-! #### The equivalence: a difficulty bound *is* a length bound

The pair below is **the** answer to the `DifficultyBounded` residual, and it is worth stating what
it settles. `D` looks like a bound on formula complexity — `estimateBranchDifficulty` weights
`untl`/`snce` by `3` and `box` by `2`, so the name invites that reading. It is not. Up to a factor
of `4`, `DifficultyBounded fc U D` and `StepLengthBounded fc U L` are the same hypothesis:

* forwards, `stepLengthBounded_of_difficultyBounded` turns any `D` into the length budget `4 * D`;
* backwards, `difficultyBounded_of_stepLengthBounded` turns any length budget `L` into the
  difficulty coefficient `difficultyCeiling U L`.

So the residual carries **no** information about the shapes of the formulas on a branch beyond what
confinement to `U` already gives. Everything it asks for is a bound on how *long* a successor branch
can get, and that is a statement this file can make about the engine on its own — which is what
`StepLengthGrowth` below does. The visibility of `temporalCount`/`modalCount` never entered into it. -/

/-- **The residual's real content: successors of `U`-confined branches have bounded length.**

`DifficultyBounded`'s two conjuncts verbatim — same quantifier prefix, same confinement hypothesis,
same split between the unordered successors and the `.splitOrdered` arms — with
`estimateBranchDifficulty _ ≤ D` replaced by `_.length ≤ L`. -/
def StepLengthBounded (fc : FormalSystem.ProofSystem.FrameClass) (U : Finset SignedFormula)
    (L : Nat) : Prop :=
  ∀ (b : Branch) (ord : TimeOrdering) (tr : EventualityTracker), (∀ x ∈ b, x ∈ U) →
    (∀ nb ∈ unorderedSuccessorBranches (expandOnceUnblocked b ord fc tr).1, nb.length ≤ L) ∧
    (∀ bs, (expandOnceUnblocked b ord fc tr).1 = ExpansionResult.splitOrdered bs →
        ∀ p ∈ bs, p.1.length ≤ L)

/-- **A length budget buys the difficulty coefficient outright.**

`UniverseClosed` supplies confinement of every successor, `StepLengthBounded` supplies the length,
and `estimateBranchDifficulty_le_ceiling` converts the pair into `difficultyCeiling U L`.

**On the `.splitOrdered` arms.** `UniverseClosed`'s *second* conjunct is exactly what they need, and
no extra hypothesis is required: by `expandOnceUnblocked_splitOrdered_shape` the three arms are
`(b, _)`, `(b, _)` and `(b.identifyTime t₂ t₁, _)`, so arms 1-2 are confined by the incoming
hypothesis and arm 3 by the identification clause. That the identification clause was introduced for
this shape is why it is stated about `Branch.identifyTime` rather than about the engine step.

**Correction, recorded rather than glossed.** That second conjunct is **false at every nonempty `U`**
(`universeClosed_identify_retime_false`), so this theorem is a true conditional whose closure
antecedent no caller can supply. The cause is that the conjunct quantifies the merge *target* `t₁`
over all of `TimeIndex`, whereas this proof only ever needs it at the trigger's own `t₁` — which
`firstIncomparablePair_spec` puts in `b.knownTimes`. `difficultyBounded_of_stepLengthBounded_at` is
the same statement at the repaired `UniverseClosedAt`, and it is the usable one. This theorem's
statement and proof are unchanged; the sibling is additive. Register entry 10 records the refutation. -/

/-! #### The satisfiable form, and the rule-local obligation it isolates

The equivalence above says what the residual *is*; it does not make it true, and
`difficultyBounded_multiplicity_false` says it is not. What is true is the same statement with the
incoming branch's length bounded — `DifficultyBoundedAt` — and that form is reachable from a single
rule-local growth inequality, `StepLengthGrowth`. The reduction is
`difficultyBoundedAt_ceiling`, and the difference in character between the two obligations is the
point of this block:

* `DifficultyBounded` asks for a bound on `estimateBranchDifficulty` at *every* `U`-confined branch,
  which by `estimateBranchDifficulty_length_le` means a bound on the length of every `U`-confined
  branch. Confinement provides none, and no invariant supplies one. There is nothing to prove.
* `StepLengthGrowth fc c` asks, for each of `applyRule`'s arms separately, that the emitted list be
  linear in the incoming branch. That is a finite case analysis over a fixed function, with every
  arm's answer already visible in its source text. It is left unproved **by scope decision**, not by
  discovery of an obstruction, and the obligation map below is recorded so a follow-up needs no
  fresh reconnaissance. -/

/-- **The rule-local growth obligation: every successor is linear in the branch it came from.**

`c` is a parameter, so the constant may be widened freely without restating anything downstream.
`RunInvariant b ord` is present because four arms emit a list indexed by the *ordering* rather than
by the branch, and only `OrdTimesKnown` ties the two together.

### The obligation map

`applyRule` (`Tableau.lean:630`) has **36** arms. Every one is accounted for here; the largest
emitted list anywhere is `2 + 4 * b.length`, so a successor `formulas ++ b` has length at most
`2 + 5 * b.length` and `c = 5` suffices.

**Constant arms** — emitted length independent of the branch:
* `.andPos` 635, `.orNeg` 650, `.impNeg` 658: exactly `2`.
* `.andNeg` 640, `.orPos` 645, `.impPos` 655: `.branching`, each arm exactly `1`.
* `.negPos` 661, `.negNeg` 666: exactly `1`.
* `.boxTemporal` 743: a `filter` of a two-element list, so at most `2`.
* `.orderTrichotomy` 1282: `.branching` with three arms, each of length exactly `2`
  (`[pos d l0, sf]`).
* `.denseIndicatorClosure` 1331: `.linear []`, length `0`.
* `.priorUZ` 1388, `.priorSZ` 1398, `.z1Rule` 1408, `.priorUGap` 1429, `.priorSGap` 1445,
  `.sepRule` 1464: six arms, each `.persistent [newSf]`, length exactly `1`.
* `.serialityRule` 1486: a `filter` of a two-element list, so at most `2`.

**Branch-mapped arms** — emitted length `Θ(b.length)`, thirteen of them:
* `.boxPos` 671 and `.diamondNeg` 731: one `filterMap` over `branch.knownWorlds`, so at most
  `b.length`.
* `.boxNeg` 679 and `.diamondPos` 704: `witness :: boxProps ++ diaProps`, two `filterMap`s over
  branch selectors, so at most `1 + 2 * b.length`.
* `.densityRule` 1338: `witness :: gProps`, so at most `1 + b.length`.
* `.allFutureNeg` 760, `.allPastNeg` 800, `.someFuturePos` 831, `.somePastPos` 875:
  `witness :: gProps ++ fNegProps ++ modalProps`, where `modalProps` is
  `boxDiamondPersistence` (`Tableau.lean:434-442`) and is itself two branch `filterMap`s
  concatenated — four branch-length terms in all, so at most `1 + 4 * b.length`.
* the `.branching` arms of `.untlPos` 921, `.sncePos` 968, `.untlNeg` 1013, `.snceNeg` 1144:
  `[…] ++ autoProp` with `autoProp = gProps ++ fNegProps ++ modalProps`, so at most
  `2 + 4 * b.length`. **These are the widest arms in the function**, and they are what fixes
  `c = 5`.

**Ordering-driven arms** — four of them, and the reason `RunInvariant` appears in the hypothesis:
* `.allFuturePos` 751 and `.someFutureNeg` 863 `filterMap` over `timeOrd.futureOf l.time`;
  `.allPastPos` 791 and `.somePastNeg` 907 over `timeOrd.pastOf l.time`.
* `futureOf`/`pastOf` (`SignedFormula.lean:776`, `782`) are duplicate-free: `reachableForward` and
  `reachableBackward` (`SignedFormula.lean:741-758`) `eraseDups` each layer and filter it against
  the visited set. Every element is the target of an ordering constraint, so `OrdTimesKnown`
  puts it in `b.knownTimes`, whose length is at most `b.length` because
  `Branch.knownTimes` is a map-then-`eraseDups` of `b`. Hence at most `b.length` again — but only
  under the invariant, which is why the invariant is a hypothesis here and not in
  `StepLengthBounded`.

**The `.branchingOrdered` arm** — `.timeLinearity` 1513, the one already-benign family: its three
arms are `(b, _)`, `(b, _)` and `(b.identifyTime t₂ t₁, _)`, and `Branch.identifyTime` is
`(b.map relabel).eraseDups`, so all three have length at most `b.length` with no `c` needed. -/

        ∀ p ∈ bs, p.1.length ≤ c * b.length + c)

/-- **The satisfiable form of the difficulty residual.**

`DifficultyBounded`'s two conjuncts with `RunInvariant b ord` and `b.length ≤ L` added as
hypotheses, in `MintPaysForTime`'s hypothesis order so the residual family reads uniformly. The
added length hypothesis is precisely what `difficultyBounded_multiplicity_false` shows cannot be
dispensed with: without it the statement is false at every `D`. -/

    (∀ bs, (expandOnceUnblocked b ord fc tr).1 = ExpansionResult.splitOrdered bs →
        ∀ p ∈ bs, estimateBranchDifficulty p.1 ≤ D)

/-- **The reduction.** A rule-local growth constant plus universe closure gives the satisfiable form
of the difficulty residual outright, with `D` read off as `difficultyCeiling U (c * L + c)`.

Proving `StepLengthGrowth fc c` for a concrete `c` — the map on `StepLengthGrowth` says `c = 5`
works — would therefore turn this into an **unconditional** discharge of the satisfiable form,
which is the furthest this residual can be taken. -/

/-! #### The residual as literally stated is refutable, at every `D`

The refutation, in one paragraph. Take `sf₀ := F(p → q)` at the initial label and
`U₀ := {sf₀, T p, F q}` — closed enough that `sf₀`'s one step stays inside it. Take
`b := List.replicate n sf₀`: a branch consisting of `n` copies of a single formula, which is
`U₀`-confined for every `n` because confinement is a statement about *membership*, not about
multiplicity. The engine's step at `b` is `.impNeg`, emitting `[T p, F q]`, so the successor has
length `n + 2`, and `estimateBranchDifficulty_length_le` puts its difficulty at least
`1 + (n + 2) / 4`. Instantiating at `n := 4·D + 4` makes that `D + 2`, which exceeds `D`. Hence no
`D` bounds the difficulty of the successors of `U₀`-confined branches, and
`DifficultyBounded fc U₀ D` is false — at **every** `D` and at **every** frame class.

**Why the reduction goes through generically in `n`.** Every engine function the step consults is
insensitive to the duplication:

* `blockedTimes b ord fc tr` is `b.knownTimes.filter (isTemporallyBlockedSaturated …)`, and at
  `ord = TimeOrdering.empty` the candidate list `blockCandidates` is empty at every time, so the
  filter's predicate is `false` everywhere. `blockedTimes_empty` records this for an **arbitrary**
  branch, frame class and tracker — it is not a fact about this witness at all.
* `findUnexpandedUnblockedWith` is a `List.find?`, so it short-circuits on the head, which is `sf₀`.
* `findApplicableRule` consults `allRulesForFC fc`, whose first three entries are the Dedekind rules
  and whose next two are `.negPos`/`.negNeg`; all five are inapplicable to a `.neg`-signed
  implication between atoms, so `.impNeg` — third in `allRules` — is the first rule to fire, at every
  frame class. Its `fs.all branch.contains` guard passes because `T p` is not among the copies of
  `sf₀`.

None of this is a `decide` on a fixed `n`: `findApplicableRule_multWitness` holds for any branch not
already carrying `T p`, and `expandOnceUnblocked_multBranch` for any `n ≥ 1`. -/

theorem length_multBranch (n : Nat) : (multBranch n).length = n := by simp [multBranch]

/-- **`DifficultyBounded fc U D` is refuted, at every `D` and every frame class.**

Not merely unproved: false. The witness is `multUniverse` and the padded branch
`multBranch (4 * D + 4)`, which is `U`-confined because confinement is about membership, and whose
`.impNeg` successor has length `4 * D + 6` and hence difficulty at least `D + 2`.

This is why the landed terminus's `hD` hypothesis is unsatisfiable at any universe the engine fires
on, and hence why `buildTableauAt_isSome_of_lengthBudget` is a repair rather than a convenience: the
`DifficultyBounded`-shaped statements are true conditionals that no caller can discharge. The
repaired hypothesis is `StepLengthBounded`, and `stepLengthBounded_of_difficultyBounded` shows the
exchange loses nothing that was ever available.

Note where the refutation does **not** come from. It is not about formula complexity — the witness is
an implication between two atoms, with zero temporal and zero modal operators, so both of
`estimateBranchDifficulty`'s weighted counters are `0` on it. The entire refutation runs through the
`b.length / 4` term. Making `temporalCount` and `modalCount` public in `Saturation.lean` would leave
every step of this argument intact. -/

/-- **The measure drops at `.extended` and at every arm of a `.split`.**

Both residual disjuncts are discharged, and the second is the interesting one: a mint may raise the
known-time count by as much as it lowered the potential, so the rank may rise by that many units of
`Tmax² + 1` plus a full incomparable-pair range. The weight `2·(Tmax² + 1)` pays for both with a
unit left over, which is why the drop is by at least one however many times the step mints. -/

**`expandBranchWithFuel` does not exhaust, with the branching arms discharged rather than
excluded.**

The measure is instantiated at `σ = id`, which is the intrinsic mint potential: the renaming is
introduced by the run's own identification arms, not by the statement.

**The residual hypotheses, listed as the phase's scope hypothesis requires.** Four appear, and each
is named above with what would discharge it: `UniverseClosed` (closure of `U` under the engine's
steps *and* under an identification's relabelling), `DifficultyBounded` and `β ≥ 3` (the two
coefficients `splitAwareFuel` already carries as an interface), `MintPaysForTime` (the time
dimension — the one genuinely open mathematical obligation, carrying the σ-hit/time-reuse question,
and discharged outright on the `untl`/`snce`-free fragment by section D3)
and `ArmSettlement` (`resolveOpenArm`'s reachable `none`, which `Fuel.lean` carries in the same
form). None of them is the unbranching restriction under another name: each is a bound or a
closure condition, all
four `ExpansionResult` shapes remain admissible under every one of them, and
`branchingWitness_splits` exhibits a branch at which the engine genuinely splits.

`BudgetedTotality`'s branch-budget hypothesis is `branchesUsed + β · fuel ≤ maxBranches`, which at
`β = 0` says only `branchesUsed ≤ maxBranches` — and the engine's very first line returns `none`
when `branchesUsed ≥ maxBranches`. Taking both to be zero satisfies every hypothesis and refutes
the conclusion, at every frame class, every difficulty coefficient and every branch.

This is why `BudgetedTotalityAt` above is stated with `β ≥ 3` on the theorem rather than with the
budget hypothesis left as it stands: `β ≥ 1` is what makes the budget hypothesis strict, and
`β ≥ 3` is what the measured split arity asks for. A reader who "simplifies" the coefficient away
is re-attempting a refuted statement. -/

`expandBranchWithFuel_isSome_of_budget` would be worth nothing if its hypotheses secretly excluded
the branching shapes — that is precisely what the unbranching restriction did, and removing the
name while keeping
the exclusion would be removing it in name only. The witness below is the mechanical check: at a
branch carrying `T(p → q)` the engine's step is a genuine `.split` with two arms, and the expansion
still terminates. The check is by evaluation and by `decide`, not by inspection. -/
