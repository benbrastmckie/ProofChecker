/-! # C11. Clause 1's label dimension, discharged from branch-side headroom

**What this section spends.** Section C10 left clause 1's label dimension as the named residual
`UnorderedSuccessorLabelClosed`, and its obligation map recorded one coordinate as available and one
as absent: the world coordinate had `applyRule_emitted_world_dichotomy`, and the time coordinate had
no statement at all bounding the times a rule emits at. Section D1 has since landed exactly that
statement — `applyRule_emitted_time_dichotomy`, together with the engine-level
`unorderedSuccessor_time_dichotomy`. This section spends it, and the accounting is now complete in
both coordinates.

**What completing the accounting does and does not buy.** It buys the *reduction*: the label
dimension of every unordered successor follows from a branch-side headroom condition, as a theorem
(`unorderedSuccessor_label_mem_of_headroom`), with nothing left unaccounted. It does **not** buy the
residual's discharge, and no lemma could have: clause 1 is *refuted* at a fixed finite
`signedUniverse C L` (`universeClosed_fresh_world_escapes`), and no condition on `L` repairs it
(`freshWorldHeadroom_not_universal`). So the residual survives — but it survives for a proved reason
rather than for a missing lemma, and that is the difference this section makes. The honest bracket is
stated as `freshLabelHeadroom_not_universal`.

**The rectangle, and why the world condition alone was never enough.** A label is a *pair*. The two
dichotomies are per-coordinate: a successor's worlds lie in `b.worldFinset ∪ {b.nextWorld}` and its
times lie in `b.knownTimes ∪ {b.nextTime}`, but nothing correlates the two, so four quadrants have to
be covered rather than two. `FreshWorldHeadroom` covers one of them. Confinement of `b` covers *not
even one*: `∀ x ∈ b, x.label ∈ L` says the pairs `b` actually carries are in `L`, which does not put
`⟨w, t⟩` in `L` for a `w` and a `t` that `b` carries on different formulas. `FreshLabelHeadroom` is
the rectangle the two dichotomies actually license, and `freshWorldHeadroom_of_freshLabelHeadroom`
records that it is the strictly stronger of the two. This is the same rectangle shape
`timeMergeClosed_iff_product` found on the clause-2 side, arrived at from the opposite direction. -/

/-- **The world dichotomy at engine level.** Every world an unordered successor mentions is a world
`b` mentioned, or `b.nextWorld`. One step adds at most the one fresh world, and never more.

The exact counterpart of `unorderedSuccessor_time_dichotomy`, assembled the same way and through the
same invariant-agnostic machinery — `pick_branches_eq`, `pick_stage_source`, `resultBranch_sub` — so
the three-stage pick is not destructured a second time. It carries **no** auxiliary hypothesis where
its time twin carries `OrdTimesKnown b ord`: `applyRule_emitted_world_dichotomy` needs nothing, since
no rule propagates a world through the `TimeOrdering` the way four of them propagate times through
`futureOf` / `pastOf`. See `applyRule_emitted_time_mem_ordTimesKnown_needed` for why the asymmetry is
real rather than an artifact of the proof. -/

/-- **The branch-side headroom condition the label dimension actually needs**: the rectangle spanned
by the branch's worlds-plus-one against its times-plus-one lies in `L`.

Stated in exactly the shape the two dichotomies deliver — a disjunction per coordinate — so that no
step of `unorderedSuccessor_label_mem_of_headroom` has to reconcile a `Finset` form with a `List`
form. Four quadrants, not two, because the dichotomies are per-coordinate and nothing correlates
them; and the quadrant `⟨w, t⟩` with `w` and `t` both already on `b` is **not** free, because
confinement of `b` constrains the pairs `b` carries and not their cross product.

`FreshWorldHeadroom` is the third quadrant alone (`freshWorldHeadroom_of_freshLabelHeadroom`). Like
it, this is a condition on the **branch**: `freshLabelHeadroom_not_universal` proves it cannot be
moved into `L`. -/
def FreshLabelHeadroom (L : Finset Label) (b : Branch) : Prop :=
  ∀ w, (w ∈ b.worldFinset ∨ w = b.nextWorld) →
    ∀ t, (t ∈ b.knownTimes ∨ t = b.nextTime) → (⟨w, t⟩ : Label) ∈ L

/-- The rectangle condition is the strictly stronger of the two headroom conditions: it is
`FreshWorldHeadroom` plus the three quadrants that one omits. -/
theorem freshWorldHeadroom_of_freshLabelHeadroom {L : Finset Label} {b : Branch}
    (h : FreshLabelHeadroom L b) : FreshWorldHeadroom L b :=
  fun t ht => h b.nextWorld (Or.inr rfl) t (Or.inl ht)

/-- **Clause 1's label dimension, discharged.** Every formula on every unordered successor of an
`L`-confined branch with headroom sits at a label of `L`.

This is the statement the Phase 7 blocker named, and it is now a theorem rather than a hypothesis.
Both coordinates are accounted for and neither is assumed: `unorderedSuccessor_world_dichotomy` for
the world, `unorderedSuccessor_time_dichotomy` for the time, `FreshLabelHeadroom` for the four
quadrants they leave. Nothing else is used — in particular, confinement of `b` is **not** among the
hypotheses, because the headroom rectangle already subsumes what confinement would have supplied.

`OrdTimesKnown b ord` is inherited from the time dichotomy and is not new currency:
`ordTimesKnown_empty` supplies it at a run's seed and `expandOnceUnblocked_ordTimesKnown` propagates
it across every step, so nothing reaches the terminus that was not already there. -/

/-- **Clause 1 at `signedUniverse C L`, both dimensions, with no residual left standing.**

The composite the Phase 7 blocker was blocking. `TableauClosed C` and `TrichStock C` discharge the
formula coordinate via `unorderedSuccessor_formula_mem`; `FreshLabelHeadroom L b` discharges the
label coordinate via `unorderedSuccessor_label_mem_of_headroom`. Contrast
`unorderedSuccessor_confined_signedUniverse_of_headroom`, which is the same statement carrying
`UnorderedSuccessorLabelClosed fc L` as an unanalyzed hypothesis: that one is retained verbatim and
is what the landed terminus chain consumes; this one is the analysis of it.

The two are not interchangeable, and the difference is exactly the quantifier. This form is
**per-branch**: the headroom is a hypothesis about the `b` in front of it. The residual form
quantifies over every `L`-confined branch at once, and in that position the headroom is *refutable*
(`freshLabelHeadroom_not_universal`). So this theorem does not discharge the residual — see the
section note. -/

/-- **The residual, restated with the ordering hypothesis the time coordinate needs.**

`UnorderedSuccessorLabelClosed` quantifies over an arbitrary `TimeOrdering` with nothing tying it to
the branch, which is one hypothesis short of what `unorderedSuccessor_time_dichotomy` asks. This is
the same predicate with `OrdTimesKnown b ord` added, and it is therefore the *weaker* of the two —
`unorderedSuccessorLabelClosedOrd_of_unorderedSuccessorLabelClosed` records the implication. The
original is retained verbatim and is what the landed chain consumes; this one exists so that the
reduction below can be stated at all.

The added hypothesis is not a new cost at any consuming site:
`applyRule_emitted_time_mem_ordTimesKnown_needed` shows it is not removable, `ordTimesKnown_empty`
supplies it at a seed, and `expandOnceUnblocked_ordTimesKnown` propagates it. -/

    (∀ x ∈ b, x.label ∈ L) →
    ∀ nb ∈ unorderedSuccessorBranches (expandOnceUnblocked b ord fc tr).1, ∀ x ∈ nb, x.label ∈ L

/-- The ordering-hypothesis form is implied by the original, as adding a hypothesis always does. -/

    (h : UnorderedSuccessorLabelClosed fc L) : UnorderedSuccessorLabelClosedOrd fc L :=
  fun b ord tr _ hbl => h b ord tr hbl

/-- **The reduction, complete.** The residual follows from branch-side headroom on every `L`-confined
branch. No coordinate is left unaccounted, and no hypothesis, placeholder or unfinished step stands
the two.

This is what section D1's arrival makes provable. Read together with
`freshLabelHeadroom_not_universal` it is also the *end* of the line: the antecedent is refutable at
every nonempty `L`, so the reduction is complete without being a discharge. -/

  fun b _ _ haux hbl => unorderedSuccessor_label_mem_of_headroom haux (h b hbl)

/-- **The rectangle cannot be moved into `L` either**, at every nonempty finite `L`.

Immediate from `freshWorldHeadroom_not_universal` through
`freshWorldHeadroom_of_freshLabelHeadroom`: the rectangle is the stronger condition, so refuting the
weaker one refutes it too. Stated separately because it is the load-bearing half of this section's
verdict — `unorderedSuccessorLabelClosedOrd_of_headroom` reduces the residual to exactly this
antecedent, and this says the antecedent is unavailable wherever the terminus is not vacuous.

So `UnorderedSuccessorLabelClosed` remains a residual, and now for a *proved* reason rather than for
a missing lemma. Register entry 11 records the finding; entry 21 records this refinement of it. -/

  fun h => freshWorldHeadroom_not_universal L hne
    fun b hb => freshWorldHeadroom_of_freshLabelHeadroom (h b hb)

/-- **The weakened residual is still refutable**, so the reduction above is not a reduction to
something already true.

The same witness `unorderedSuccessorLabelClosed_not_universal` uses, with the added ordering
hypothesis supplied by `ordTimesKnown_empty` — the witness runs at `TimeOrdering.empty`, so nothing
had to be rebuilt. Adding `OrdTimesKnown` to the residual therefore does not weaken it into
vacuity. -/

/-! ### The refutation generalizes: **every** nonempty `L`, not merely one witness

`unorderedSuccessorLabelClosed_not_universal` and `unorderedSuccessorLabelClosedOrd_not_universal`
refute the residual at one particular label set, `freshWorldLabels = {⟨0,0⟩}`. That is enough to
show it is not a theorem, but it leaves open the reading — which the earlier phrasing of register
entry 11 invited — that the residual might hold at *other* label sets, so that a consuming site
could be repaired by choosing `L` more carefully.

It cannot. The generalization is mechanical, and for a structural reason: the engine's shape gates
match a signed formula's **sign and formula constructor**, never its label. So `F(□p)` fires
`.boxNeg` at every label, not only at `Label.initial`, and what the rule emits always sits at the
branch's `Branch.nextWorld`, which at a one-formula branch labelled `l` is `l.world + 1` — this is
what `arAt_bn` below records, by `rfl`, with `l` a free variable. Running the witness at a label of
**maximal world** in `L` therefore puts the emission outside `L`'s world projection by maximality,
at every nonempty finite `L` and every frame class.

The other end is immediate: at `L = ∅` the confinement hypothesis `∀ x ∈ b, x.label ∈ L` forces
`b = []`, the pick finds nothing, and the conclusion holds vacuously. So the residual's
satisfiability set is **exactly `{∅}`** — and `∅` is precisely the case in which every theorem
carrying it as a hypothesis has an empty universe and says nothing.

The family below is stated **beside** the `freshWorld*` family, not in place of it: the
single-witness form is what the file's earlier sections cite, and it is not withdrawn. -/

Stated at the `Ord` form because that is the **weaker** predicate: `OrdTimesKnown` is supplied for

One line from the `Ord` form through

refutation argument rather than two copies of it.

This is the statement any downstream artifact should cite. It says that
`unorderedSuccessorLabelClosed_not_universal`'s single witness was not a peculiarity of
`freshWorldLabels`: there is no finite nonempty label set at which the residual can be assumed, and
so every theorem carrying it as a live hypothesis is a vacuously true conditional wherever its

Not a discharge in any useful sense: confinement to `∅` forces `b = []`, the pick finds no
