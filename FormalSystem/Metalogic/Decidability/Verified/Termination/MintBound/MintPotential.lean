/-! # C1. The world dimension, and a time bound that does not go through the mint chain

Two independent obligations meet here.

**The time bound must not be circular.** `|U| = |signedUniverse C L|` with `L = worlds × times`,
while times grow by minting — so a time bound derived *from* the mint count would make the whole
chain circular. `timeFinset_card_le_of_mem_stock` below is the non-circular route, and it is
non-circular for a reason that can be read off its hypotheses rather than argued: branch-confined-
to-stock, linearity-saturated, eventuality-fulfilled, blocking-silent. **Not one of the four
mentions a world, a mint, or `|U|`.** Its conclusion `2 ^ (2 * |C|)` is a function of the stock
alone.

**The world dimension.** `worldFinset_card_le` turns the fresh-world discipline `WorldWitness`
into `|worlds| ≤ |S| + 2·|C|·|times|`, and `Branch.card_labelFinset_le` multiplies the two
dimensions into the label bound that `expandBranchWithFuel_isSome_at_worldFuel'` takes as `hL`.
`labelFinset_card_le_of_worldWitness` assembles exactly that, and `seedWorlds_card` pins `s = 1`
at the engine's own seed.

**What is discharged here and what is not, stated plainly.** `WorldWitness` is discharged **at the
seed branch** (`worldWitness_seedBranch`), which is what fixes `s = 1`. It is **not** discharged as
a run-level invariant: `chain_le_worldFuel'` wants `WorldWitness C S (run n)` at step `n`, and
establishing that is an induction over `applyRule`'s 36 constructors whose content is the
injectivity clause — a second world minted for the same sign/formula/time would have found the
first one's witness and been suppressed, which is `witnessPresent`'s world-indifference. That
induction is not attempted here. The residual is therefore exactly one named hypothesis,
`WorldWitness C (seedBranch φ).worldFinset b`, and every result below carries it visibly in its
statement rather than absorbing it. -/

/-- **The engine's seed branch.** Both `buildTableauAt` and `buildTableau` open with the single
signed formula `¬φ` at `Label.initial` and hand it to `expandBranchWithFuel` together with
`TimeOrdering.empty`. Named here so the seed-side facts cite one shape instead of repeating it. -/
def seedBranch (φ : Formula) : Branch := [SignedFormula.neg φ Label.initial]

/-- **The seed mentions exactly one world**, world `0` — which is what makes `s = 1` the right
instantiation of the world bound's seed parameter, rather than a figure chosen for convenience. -/
theorem seedWorlds_card (φ : Formula) : (seedBranch φ).worldFinset.card = 1 := rfl

/-- **`WorldWitness` at the seed.** Discharged, not assumed: at `S := (seedBranch φ).worldFinset`
every world of the branch lies in `S`, so both clauses of the discipline are satisfied by absence
of a non-seed world.

This is `worldWitness_self` at the seed, and — unlike the degenerate reading its docstring warns
about — it is *not* empty here, because `seedWorlds_card` computes `|S| = 1`. The world bound's
first summand is therefore a constant, which is the whole point of scoping to the seed. -/

    WorldWitness C (seedBranch φ).worldFinset (seedBranch φ) :=
  worldWitness_self C (seedBranch φ)

/-- **T2, in the form this chain consumes, and demonstrably not circular.**

`timeFinset_card_le_of_not_blocked` wants `TimeChain b ord`; `timeChain_of_linearity_saturated`
supplies it from the linearity stage's own silence, since `timeLinearity` is self-suppressing and
fires exactly while an incomparable pair remains. Composing the two leaves four hypotheses, and the
reason the mint bound may rest on this is that **none of them mentions a world, a mint, or the
signed universe**: the bound `2 ^ (2 * |C|)` is a function of the stock alone. -/

injects labels into their two components. -/

The one input not discharged in this module is `hww` — the fresh-world discipline **at the run's
branch `b`**, not at the seed. It is carried explicitly rather than absorbed, so that a consumer
can see precisely what remains: `worldWitness_seedBranch` gives the `n = 0` case, and the step case
is the 36-constructor induction described in the section preamble. -/

/-! ## C2. The fresh-world discipline is preserved by a rule application

`WorldWitness` as `Fuel.lean` states it is **not inductive**: its witness function `wit` is
constrained only by `(wit w).formula ∈ C` and `(wit w).label.time ∈ b.timeFinset`, and is not
required to lie on the branch or to sit at the world it witnesses. The preservation argument needs
both: at a fresh-world mint, the new world's witness is distinct from every existing one *because*
an existing witness **on the branch** carrying the same sign, formula and time would have made
`witnessPresent` true and suppressed the mint. With `wit w` free-floating there is nothing to feed
the guard.

The repair is the same shape as this file's `OrdTimesKnown` repair: `WorldWitnessKnown` below
carries `wit w ∈ b ∧ (wit w).label.world = w` alongside the existing clauses,
`worldWitness_of_known` derives the weak form from it (the strengthening witness, mirroring
`ordTimesLeMaxTime_of_ordTimesKnown`), and the induction runs on the strong form. `Fuel.lean` is
not edited.

The world dimension is much narrower than the times dimension: of `TableauRule`'s 36
constructors exactly **two** — `boxNeg` and `diamondPos` — mint a world, and both do it by
emitting at `Branch.nextWorld`. `applyRule_emitted_world_mem` discharges the other 34 in one
split; the two minting rules are then handled by name, with the guard supplying the injectivity
clause. -/

/-! ### The strengthened discipline -/

/-- **The fresh-world discipline, strengthened so that it is inductive.**

`WorldWitness` (`Fuel.lean`) says only that each non-seed world's witness has a stock formula and
a branch time. This adds the two clauses the preservation argument needs and the weak form omits:
the witness lies **on the branch**, and it sits at the world it witnesses. Both are what let the
`witnessPresent` guard be applied at a mint — the guard scans the branch for a formula at a known
world, so a witness that is neither on the branch nor at its own world cannot be fed to it.

`worldWitness_of_known` recovers the weak form, so every landed `WorldWitness` consumer keeps
working. This is a strengthening, not a weakening. -/

/-- **The strengthening witness.** The strong discipline implies the weak one, with the same

/-! ### The guard, extracted from the pick

`witnessPresent` is tested by `findApplicableRule` **only** at the eight `ruleMintsFreshLabel`
rules, and only in its `.linear` and `.branching` arms. Both world-minting rules live there —
`applyRule_boxNeg_result` and `applyRule_diamondPos_result` rule out the two unguarded arms — so
the guard is recoverable exactly where the fresh-world discipline needs it. The seriality and
linearity stages need no guard at all: they run one rule each, and neither is world-minting. -/

/-! ### Why the ordered split is excluded, stated rather than glossed

The identification arm relabels every branch formula by `rho`, and `rho` **merges** two times.
Two non-seed worlds whose witnesses differ only in carrying the merged pair of times have
*distinct* signatures before the arm and the *same* signature after it, so the injectivity clause
of `WorldWitnessKnown` is not transported along `rhoSF`. That is a genuine failure of the
invariant at arm 3, of exactly the kind `ordTimes_identifyTime_arm3_false` records for the
ordering-times invariant — not a gap in this proof.

It costs nothing here. `ExtendStep` (`Fuel.lean`) is defined as
`(expandOnceUnblocked b ord fc tr).1 = .extended nb`, so every run that `chain_le_worlds_bounded`
and `chain_le_worldFuel'` quantify over is `.extended`-only: no split of either kind occurs along
it, and `expandOnceUnblocked_worldWitnessKnown` covers every step such a run can take. A consumer

/-! ## C3. The mint potential

The count of `(rule, signed formula)` pairs still eligible to mint. Witness preservation makes it
non-increasing along a run, and a mint makes it strictly decrease, which is what turns "each pair
mints at most once" into a *per-state* quantity a fuel induction can carry.

### The carried renaming is not decoration — read this before simplifying it away

The obvious measure filters `freshLabelRules ×ˢ U` by `witnessPresent r sf b ord = false` at the
current state. **That measure is not available at the ordered split's identification arm**, and the
reason is the same non-injectivity that `ordTimes_identifyTime_arm3_false` exhibits for the
ordering-times invariant. `rhoSF t₂ t₁` merges `t₂` into `t₁`, so it is not injective on `U`, and a
counting argument at arm 3 would need an injection from the after-false set into the before-false
set. The map that suggests itself is not one: after the arm the branch carries **nothing** at `t₂`,
so every pair whose formula sits at `t₂` reports no witness at the successor, while a pair at `t₂`
whose witness also sat at `t₂` reported one before — a local *increase*, with no partner to absorb
it. Whether the simultaneous decreases at `t₁` dominate is not decided here in either direction.

`mintPotential` therefore carries the accumulated renaming `σ` as an explicit parameter and
filters on `witnessPresent r (σ sf) b ord = false`. The index set `freshLabelRules ×ˢ U` is then
**fixed for the whole run**, so successive potentials are cardinalities of subsets of one finset
and compare directly, and each of the two step shapes is a pointwise *subset* fact needing no
injection:

* an ordinary step keeps `σ` and grows branch and ordering — `mintPotential_le_of_grow`, from the
  two `witnessPresent` monotonicity lemmas;
* arm 3 post-composes `rhoSF t₂ t₁` onto `σ` — `mintPotential_identifyTime`, from
  `arm3_preserves_witness` read contrapositively.

Post-composition is what makes the measure compose along a run carrying **any number** of
identifications, rather than only the first one: `σ` is a parameter of the measure, not a fixed
choice inside it. `mints_le_eight_mul` is that composition, in the form the counting consumes.
Instantiating `σ := id` recovers the intrinsic measure at any prefix of the run before the first
ordered split, so nothing is lost relative to the simpler shape where the simpler shape works.

### The residual, named rather than absorbed

`mintPotential_lt_of_mint` — the strict decrease — asks that the minting pair be **`σ`-hit**: the
formula the rule fires on must be `σ sf` for some `sf ∈ U`. `σ`'s image omits exactly the times
earlier identifications merged away, so the obligation is precisely that a minting formula does
not sit at a merged-away time. That is a question about **time reuse**, not about the measure:
`Branch.nextTime` is `Branch.maxTime + 1` and `Branch.identifyTime` can *lower* `Branch.maxTime`
(the configuration `ordTimes_identifyTime_arm3_false` decides drops it from `5` to `0`), so a
fresh time can in principle re-issue a value an earlier identification removed. The equivalent
"live times" reformulation of the potential — filter additionally on the formula's time being a
fixed point of `σ` — carries the identical obligation, which is what shows it is intrinsic to the
situation rather than an artifact of this measure's shape. Discharging it is the first obligation
of the once-only bound, and it is stated in `mintPotential_lt_of_mint`'s hypotheses rather than
assumed anywhere.

### Why the three-component impossibility does not apply

The measured obstruction recorded against the split-aware fuel figure rules out the *linear
three-component family* `Ψ = A · (|U| − |b|) + B · |knownTimes| + C · |incompPairs|`: no choice of
the three coefficients decreases on every arm, because the identification arm moves the second and
third components in opposite directions from the first. `mintPotential` is a **fourth component
outside that family** — it mentions neither `b.toFinset.card`, nor `Branch.knownTimes`, nor the
incomparable-pair count, and it is not a linear combination of them. It is a count over a fixed
index set of *witness tests*, and it is bounded by `8 * U.card` outright. The impossibility is
therefore not evidence against this measure; it is evidence against the family this measure is
not in.

### The time bound is not circular

`|U| = |signedUniverse C L|` grows with the times, and the times grow by minting, so a `Tmax`
derived from the mint count would make the chain circular. It is not derived that way:
`timeFinset_card_le_of_mem_stock` above bounds `Branch.timeFinset.card` by `2 ^ (2 * |C|)` from
branch-confined-to-stock, linearity-saturated, eventuality-fulfilled and blocking-silent. **Not
one of those four hypotheses mentions a world, a mint, or `|U|`.** The mint chain may rest on it. -/

/-- **The eight rules that mint a fresh label**, as a `Finset`, so the potential's index set is a
product. The list is exactly `ruleMintsFreshLabel`'s `true` arms — `mem_freshLabelRules` proves the

`arm3_preserves_witness`. No injection from the after-false set into the before-false set is
required, and none is available — `rhoSF t₂ t₁` is not injective on `U`.

This is the statement the induction over fuel has to close, named here so the counting block has
something fixed to aim at and so the shape cannot drift while it is being built. **Nothing here
asserts it**: it is a `Prop`-valued definition, and it is discharged where the induction is closed,
not before.

Read against `expandBranchWithFuel_isSome_of_noSplit`, four things changed and each is deliberate:

* **The unbranching-run restriction is gone**, name and all — the predicate
  `expandBranchWithFuel_isSome_of_noSplit` carries does not appear here under any spelling.
  No hypothesis restricts which `ExpansionResult` shapes the run may take,
  which is the whole point; a theorem that only applied to unbranching runs would have removed the
  restriction in name only.
* **The mint budget is an explicit parameter**, `mintBudget`, constrained only by
  `8 * U.card ≤ mintBudget` — the ceiling `mintPotential_le_eight_mul` supplies outright. It is a
  parameter this development discharges, never a caller obligation.
* **The time bound is derived from it**, `b.knownTimes.toFinset.card + mintBudget ≤ Tmax`, rather
  than assumed: each identification drops the known-time count and each mint raises it by one, so
  the initial count plus the mint budget bounds it for the whole run.
* **`RunInvariant` is the carried side condition**, on the *initial* state only. It is
  re-established at every successor by `expandOnceUnblocked_runInvariant`, and at the engine's own
  seed it is discharged outright by `runInvariant_initial`.

/-! ## C4. The once-only bound — the guard before a mint, the witness after one

The mint potential decreases at a mint for two reasons that have to be read off the source rather
than assumed, and they are proved here in that order.

**Before.** `findApplicableRule` gates every `ruleMintsFreshLabel` rule on `witnessPresent`, in
both arms that can carry one, and **instead of** the output-presence test rather than in addition
to it. This reading was checked against the source before anything was built on it: the `.linear`
arm tests `witnessPresent` under `if ruleMintsFreshLabel rule`, with the `fs.all branch.contains`
test in the *else* branch; the `.branching` arm does the same behind the `ruleSelfGuarded` test,
and `not_selfGuarded_of_fresh` proves no fresh-label rule is self-guarded, so the guard is always
reached. The `.persistent` and `.branchingOrdered` arms carry no guard, which costs nothing here
because the two lemmas below take the result shape as a hypothesis and are only ever applied at
the two shapes that do.

An `&&`-composition of the two tests would have broken the once-only argument, because a pair
could then be re-selected after its witness existed. It is not one.

**After.** All eight constructors return a syntactic cons whose head is the witness at the fresh

after a mint, the pair reports a witness — which is what makes the decrease strict rather than

/-! ### The two halves meet: a mint is a strict decrease

The guard puts the minting pair *in* the before-false set and the witness puts it *out* of the
after-false set, and the successor is a superset in both components, so the after-false set is a
strict subset of the before-false set. That is `mintPotential_lt_of_mint`, with its hypotheses now
supplied from the pick rather than assumed.

The two lemmas below are stated at the **pick**, not at the engine step, because that is where
both halves are available at once — `findApplicableRule_applyRule_pair` ties the pick's reported
result to `applyRule`'s, which is what lets the guard and the witness talk about the same rule
application. The engine's fuel induction consumes them through the pick-stage bridges.

With them, the once-only bound is complete: `mints_le_eight_mul` above turns "every step preserves
`mints + mintPotential`, and a mint pays one unit for a strict decrease" into
`#mints ≤ 8 · |U|` along a run of any length, carrying any number of ordered splits. The
conclusion mentions no branch and no branch growth, which is the property route (b) exists to
supply. -/

/-! ## C5. The counting chain — identifications, shrinkage, extensions

Three inequalities, each **absolute**: none of them refers to how long the run is, and each is a
fold of one per-step fact over the run. `fold_le_of_step` is that fold, stated once and
instantiated three times — the additive form `f (i+1) + g i ≤ f i + g (i+1)` says "`f - g` does
not increase" without ever writing a `Nat` subtraction, which is what keeps `omega` in play at
every link.

**Link 1 — `#identifications ≤ |knownTimes|₀ + #mints`.** Each identification drops the known-time
count by at least one (`knownTimes_card_lt_at_arm3`, from the landed
`knownTimes_card_lt_identifyTime` with the trigger supplying its three hypotheses); each mint
raises it by at most one; every other step leaves it alone. The three per-step arithmetic facts
are `identStep_le`, `mintStep_le`, `plainStep_le`.

**The payoff is that the time bound is derived rather than assumed, and this is what makes the
mint budget a discharged parameter instead of a residual.** Composing link 1 with
`mints_le_eight_mul` bounds the known-time count along the whole run by
`|knownTimes|₀ + 8 * |U|`, which is `derivedTmax`. `BudgetedTotality`'s time hypothesis is
satisfied at that value by `derivedTmax_spec`, definitionally — nothing is assumed about `Tmax`
anywhere in this development.

**Link 2 — `total shrinkage ≤ #identifications · |U|`.** A single identification's `eraseDups`
merge cannot remove more than the branch had, and the branch is confined to `U`, so
`shrinkage_le_card` bounds one identification's loss by `|U|` outright.

**This is an UPPER bound on the loss, and it must not be confused with the refuted lower bound.**
Route (a) sought a *lower* bound on `(b.identifyTime t₂ t₁).toFinset.card` in terms of
`b.toFinset.card`, and that is dead by definition: `Branch.identifyTime` is
`(b.map relabel).eraseDups` and the merge is bounded only by `|U|` in the direction taken here.
Bounding the loss from above is available; bounding the survivors from below is not. A reader
meeting `shrinkage_le_card` and thinking it revives route (a) has the direction backwards.

**Link 3 — `#extensions ≤ |U| + total shrinkage`.** The branch-as-a-set grows by at least one per
extending step (`expandOnceUnblocked_card_lt`, and `expandOnceUnblocked_split_card_lt` for the
split arms) and can never exceed `|U|`; shrinkage is the only way that budget comes back.

**Assembly.** `path_le_of_links` combines the three, and `path_le_splitPathBound` checks the
result against the figure that already exists rather than introducing a new one: the assembled
bound `|U| + Tmax·|U| + Tmax` is below `splitPathBound |U| Tmax`, because `orderedRunBound` is
above `Tmax` (`orderedRunBound_ge`) and `splitPathBound` multiplies by `|U| + 1`. So Phase 13's
induction consumes `splitAwareFuel` unchanged, and **no divergence from the landed figure had to
be recorded**. -/

/-- **The fold every link of the chain uses.** If `f` gains no more than `g` does at each step,
then it has gained no more than `g` has over the whole run. Written additively so that no `Nat`
subtraction ever appears. -/

/-! ## C6. The fuel induction, over an abstract measure

The induction that closes the branching case, stated once and over an **abstract** carried state,
measure and invariant. Separating it from any particular measure is what makes it checkable: the
statement below mentions no branch cardinality, no known-time count, no mint potential and no
ordering rank, and its proof therefore cannot smuggle in a fact about any of them. All four
`ExpansionResult` shapes are discharged here — `.saturated` by the engine's own return, `.extended`
by the inductive hypothesis at one less unit of fuel, and both split shapes through the landed
folds — so the only thing a concrete measure has to supply is the per-step obligation bundle
`StepDecreases`.

**Why the carried state is a parameter rather than a fixed measure.** The mint potential carries
the accumulated renaming `σ`, and `σ` changes at the ordered split's identification arm. A measure
of the shape `Ψ : Branch → TimeOrdering → Nat` therefore cannot express it. `StepDecreases` lets
each successor *choose* its own carried state (`∃ a'`), which is exactly the disjunction
`mintPotential_expandOnceUnblocked_splitOrdered` reports.

**The two residuals this section names rather than absorbs.**

* `ArmSettlement` — `resolveOpenArm` reports `none` on an arm that is neither closed nor
  blocking-aware saturated after the post-blocking pass. `Fuel.lean` records this outcome as
  **reachable**, not dead, and carries it as the per-arm hypothesis `hres` of both fold lemmas;
  nothing here discharges it, so it appears as a hypothesis under a name. It is stated exactly in
  the form the folds consume, quantified only over arms an engine run actually produces, so it is
  not the (false) blanket claim that `resolveOpenArm` never reports `none` — at `fuel = 0` and an
  unsaturated arm it plainly does.
* the difficulty and arity coefficients `D` and `β` — carried as `StepDecreases` clauses rather
  than computed, which is the interface `Fuel.lean`'s `splitAwareFuel` already documents. The
  reason `D` is carried is **not** the `private` marker on `temporalCount`/`modalCount`:
  `estimateBranchDifficulty_length_le` and `estimateBranchDifficulty_le_of_subperm` below both
  bound it from inside this file, because `private` blocks name resolution and not unfolding. The
  real obstruction is recorded on `DifficultyBounded` and refuted by
  `difficultyBounded_multiplicity_false`; the repaired, satisfiable shape is `StepLengthBounded`. -/

/-- **The fuel a run of at most `N` engine steps needs**, at split arity `β` and per-arm difficulty
`D`.

`N` units would suffice if fuel were not divided at a split; `allocateFuelProportionally` hands an
arm only a proportional share, and `allocateFuelProportionally_ge` says an arm is guaranteed `m`
units only when `D * β * m ≤ fuel + 1`, so each split costs a factor of `D * β + 1`. Over a path of
`N` steps that is `(D * β + 1) ^ N`.

This is the landed `splitAwareFuel` with its path length made a parameter:
`fuelFigure D β (splitPathBound Ucard Tmax)` is `splitAwareFuel Ucard Tmax D β` **definitionally**
(`fuelFigure_splitAwareFuel`, by `rfl`). Nothing about the figure changes; only the path bound it
is evaluated at becomes visible. -/

/-- **The per-step obligation bundle.**

Everything a concrete measure has to supply, and nothing else. Each successor may choose its own
carried state `a'` — which is what lets the mint potential's renaming change at the ordered split's
identification arm — and every clause is stated at the engine step rather than at `applyRule`, so
no pick-stage reasoning leaks into the induction.

The `β` clauses bound the split arity and the `D` clauses bound a single arm's
`estimateBranchDifficulty`; both are the coefficients `splitAwareFuel` already carries. -/

/-- **The arm-settlement residual, named rather than absorbed.**

Both split folds short-circuit on `resolveOpenArm` reporting `none`, and `Fuel.lean` records that
outcome as **reachable**: by `resolveOpenArm_eq_none_imp` the surviving route is its final "still
not saturated" arm, where the post-blocking pass returned an open branch that `findClosure` does
not close and that the arm's own recomputed tracker does not certify as blocking-aware saturated.
That is the configuration the refuted unconditional totality statement died on, so it is a live
outcome, not a dead one.

**The quantification is the honest one.** A blanket "`resolveOpenArm` never reports `none`" is
plainly false — at `fuel = 0` and an unsaturated arm it reports `none` — so this predicate is
restricted to arms an engine run actually hands the fold: `ob` is a branch some
`expandBranchWithFuel` call returned open, and `parentFuel` is the enclosing call's own fuel, which
dominates the arm's. Whether *that* is true is exactly the open question `Fuel.lean` records;
nothing in this file decides it in either direction, and it is a hypothesis everywhere it appears.

The gap it isolates is a disagreement between two eventuality trackers: the engine reports
`.saturated` against the tracker it has threaded through the run, while `resolveOpenArm` re-derives
one from the arm's own formulas (`armTracker`). The recomputed tracker is the *stricter* of the
two, so the engine's verdict does not transfer, and closing the gap means comparing the two blocked
sets — not adding fuel. -/

/--
**The fuel induction, free of the unbranching restriction, over an abstract measure.**

Read against the landed `expandBranchWithFuel_isSome_of_noSplit`, exactly one thing is removed and
nothing is added in its place: the unbranching-run restriction is gone, name and all, and both
split shapes are discharged here rather than excluded. `.split` goes through
`expand_split_fold_isSome` with `allocateFuelProportionally_ge` and `totalDifficulty_le` supplying
the arm's fuel and `splitBudget_preserved` the arm's budget; `.splitOrdered` goes through
`expand_splitOrdered_fold_isSome` in the same shape, with each arm expanded under **its own**
ordering.

The measure is abstract, so this theorem asserts nothing about the engine's termination behaviour
by itself: it converts a per-step decrease into totality at the figure that decrease earns. The
mathematical content of the branching case lives in `StepDecreases`, and is supplied for the mint
potential further down.

`β ≥ 1` is not decoration. The engine's very first line returns `none` when
`branchesUsed ≥ maxBranches`, so a budget hypothesis has to be strict somewhere; `β * fuelFigure`
with `β ≥ 1` and a positive path bound is what makes it strict. `BudgetedTotality`'s
`β`-linear hypothesis is **not** strict at `β = 0`, which is why the naked statement is refutable
there (`budgetedTotality_beta_zero_false`).
