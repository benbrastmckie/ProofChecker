/-! # D1. The time coordinate: the minting census

The world coordinate is complete (`applyRule_emitted_world_dichotomy`). This section builds the
same accounting in the **time** coordinate, and the first thing it needs is the list of rules that
can put a formula at a time the branch does not already know. The section notes above record that
no statement in the development says what that list is. This is that statement.

**`ruleMintsFreshLabel` is the wrong list, in both directions.** It is a list of *witness-guarded*
rules — the ones `findApplicableRule` gates on `witnessPresent` — and witness-guardedness and
time-minting are two different properties:

* `boxNeg` and `diamondPos` are in `ruleMintsFreshLabel` and mint **no time**. Both emit at
  `Branch.nextWorld` while carrying the trigger's own time (their witness) or a branch formula's own
  time (their `boxPosFormulas` / `diamondNegFormulas` propagation blocks). Fresh *world*, known time.
* `densityRule` mints a time and is deliberately **absent** from `ruleMintsFreshLabel`: it carries
  its own `existingIntermediates`-style gap guard (the maximal-target filter on
  `TimeOrdering.futureOf`) instead of a witness test, so re-guarding it would have been redundant.
* the ACTIVE arms of `untlNeg` and `snceNeg` mint `Branch.nextTime` and are absent from
  `ruleMintsFreshLabel` too, because they are `ruleSelfGuarded`: they filter their target times
  through their own `unprocessed` test and re-include the trigger in every arm.

So neither list contains the other, and `freshTimeRules_incomparable_freshLabelRules` decides that
rather than asserting it. `expandOnceNoFresh` is the in-repo operational evidence for the same fact:
it runs the `ruleMintsFreshLabel` test **and then**, separately, a
`newOrd.constraints.length > timeOrd.constraints.length` test. Two tests in sequence are necessary
only when neither subsumes the other — a single test would do if one list contained the other.

**The census is read off `applyRule`, not guessed from the sibling list.** Every fresh time in
`applyRule` is `branch.nextTime`, bound at exactly nine sites: the `allFutureNeg` / `allPastNeg` /
`someFuturePos` / `somePastPos` / `untlPos` / `sncePos` arms, the ACTIVE arms of `untlNeg` /
`snceNeg`, and `densityRule`'s interpolation site. There is no `nextTime + k` anywhere, which is why
the dichotomy below has the same two-case shape as its world twin. -/

Derived by walking `applyRule`'s thirty-six constructor arms and recording which reach a

the section note above for why the two lists are incomparable. -/

   TableauRule.somePastPos, TableauRule.untlPos, TableauRule.sncePos,
   TableauRule.untlNeg, TableauRule.snceNeg, TableauRule.densityRule}

/-- The `Finset` and the `Bool` predicate agree, over all thirty-six constructors. The anti-drift
guarantee `mem_freshLabelRules` already gives the sibling list. -/
theorem mem_freshTimeRules {r : TableauRule} :
    r ∈ freshTimeRules ↔ ruleMintsFreshTime r = true := by
  cases r <;> simp [freshTimeRules, ruleMintsFreshTime]

/-- There are exactly nine, decided rather than counted by hand. -/
theorem freshTimeRules_card : freshTimeRules.card = 9 := by decide

/-- **The two rule lists are incomparable, not nested.** Both directions, decided.

The first two conjuncts are the world-minting-is-not-time-minting direction: `boxNeg` and
`diamondPos` are witness-guarded and mint no time. The last three are the converse: `densityRule`
(gap-guarded) and the `untlNeg` / `snceNeg` ACTIVE arms (`ruleSelfGuarded`) mint a time while
sitting outside `freshLabelRules`.

`expandOnceNoFresh` is the operational evidence: it tests `ruleMintsFreshLabel` and **then** tests
`newOrd.constraints.length`, two tests in sequence, which is only necessary because neither list
subsumes the other. A reader who reads "not in `ruleMintsFreshLabel`" as "introduces no time" is
re-attempting a refuted statement — see the register entry. -/

/-! ### The time-coordinate plumbing

The closers the time sweep is built from, one per emission shape `applyRule` uses. Three are
mirrors of the world sweep's helpers (`mem_filterMap_world`, `mem_filterMap_const_world`,
`mem_boxDiamondPersistence_label`); the rest have no world counterpart, and the reason each is
needed is worth stating because it is exactly the asymmetry between the two coordinates.

**The time coordinate needs an ordering hypothesis and the world coordinate does not.** Four rules —
`allFuturePos`, `allPastPos`, `someFutureNeg`, `somePastNeg` — propagate to *every* time in
`TimeOrdering.futureOf` / `pastOf` of the trigger. Nothing about `applyRule` ties those times to the
branch: a formula may be emitted at an ordering time the branch has never carried. Their world
counterparts have no such freedom, because all four emit at `l.world`. This is why
`applyRule_emitted_time_mem` below carries `OrdTimesKnown b ord` where its world twin carries
nothing, and `applyRule_emitted_time_mem_ordTimesKnown_needed` is the witness that the hypothesis is
not removable. `mem_knownTimes_of_mem_futureOf` / `_pastOf` are the bridge, and they are exactly the
reason section A7's strengthened invariant exists.

**Identification rewrites times; it does not rewrite worlds.** `mem_identifyTime_world` concludes
`∈ b.worldFinset` outright. Its time analogue cannot: `Branch.identifyTime src tgt` moves everything
at `src` to `tgt`, and `tgt` is an arbitrary parameter of the function. So `mem_identifyTime_time`
states the honest disjunction, and `mem_identifyTime_time_at_trigger` collapses it at the only place
the engine calls it — where `tgt` is the `t₁` of `firstIncomparablePair`, already a known time. An
unconditional `∈ b.knownTimes` conclusion is not available and must not be attempted. -/

/-- A backward path of at least one edge has a last edge, so its endpoint is some constraint's
*source*. The past-directed mirror of `exists_constraint_to_of_pathN`. -/
theorem exists_constraint_from_of_pathN (ord : TimeOrdering) :

the empty path. -/

their world counterparts get for free. -/

/-! #### The `boxDiamondPersistence` time component is *not* a standalone declaration

The plan for this section called for a `mem_boxDiamondPersistence_time` beside its five siblings,
projected from `mem_boxDiamondPersistence_label`. It cannot be one: `boxDiamondPersistence` is
`private` to `Tableau.lean`, so no statement outside that module can *mention* it, and a lemma
whose hypothesis is `g ∈ boxDiamondPersistence branch w t ft` is unstateable here. What is available
is the projection *applied to a hypothesis already in scope* — `(mem_boxDiamondPersistence_label
hg).1` rewrites `g.label` to `{ world := w, time := ft }`, from which the time component follows —
and that is how the per-rule `nextTime` pinning lemmas below use it, exactly as
`applyRule_emitted_world_mem` uses it in the world coordinate.

This is register entry 9's observation in the one direction where it bites: `private` blocks name
resolution, and here the *name* is what the statement needs. It does not block unfolding, so nothing
is lost at the point of use. No `boxDiamondPersistence` block occurs in any rule the sweep below
covers — all eight rules carrying one are in `freshTimeRules` — so the sweep never needs it. -/

/-- **Identification, honestly.** Everything on `b.identifyTime src tgt` sits either at the merge
target or at a time the branch already knew.

This is where the time coordinate departs from `mem_identifyTime_world`, deliberately and
irreducibly: the world lemma concludes `∈ b.worldFinset` because identification never touches a
world, whereas here `tgt` is an arbitrary parameter and everything at `src` is moved onto it. An
unconditional `∈ b.knownTimes` conclusion is therefore false as stated — take `tgt` outside
`b.knownTimes` and any nonempty branch carrying `src`. The disjunction is collapsed at the engine's
own call site by `mem_identifyTime_time_at_trigger`; it must not be collapsed here. -/
theorem mem_identifyTime_time {b : Branch} {src tgt : TimeIndex} {g : SignedFormula}
    (h : g ∈ b.identifyTime src tgt) : g.label.time = tgt ∨ g.label.time ∈ b.knownTimes := by
  simp only [Branch.identifyTime, List.mem_eraseDups, List.mem_map] at h
  obtain ⟨x, hx, rfl⟩ := h
  by_cases hc : x.label.time = src
  · exact Or.inl (by simp [hc])
  · refine Or.inr ?_
    simp only [hc, beq_iff_eq, if_false]
    exact mem_knownTimes_of_mem hx

/-- **The disjunction collapses at the trigger.** `applyRule .timeLinearity` identifies `t₂` into
`t₁` where `(t₁, t₂)` is `firstIncomparablePair b ord`, and `firstIncomparablePair_spec` already
returns `t₁ ∈ b.knownTimes`. So at the engine's own identification site — the only site there is —
the honest disjunction of `mem_identifyTime_time` closes to plain membership.

This is the same bridge move `universeClosedAt_identify_at_trigger` makes for the closure repair:
the restriction that looks like a new obligation is already discharged by the pick. -/
theorem mem_identifyTime_time_at_trigger {b : Branch} {ord : TimeOrdering} {t₁ t₂ : TimeIndex}

  · exact hg ▸ (firstIncomparablePair_spec htrig).1
  · exact hg

/-- **The same bridge at the engine's own orientation.** Arm 3 merges `min t₁ t₂` into
`max t₁ t₂`, so a formula of the post-arm branch sits either at the surviving numeral or at an
untouched time; `firstIncomparablePair_spec_oriented` puts the surviving numeral in
`b.knownTimes`. This is the form `applyRule_emitted_time_mem` consumes at the `timeLinearity`
arm. -/

/-! ### `applyRule_emitted_time_mem`: the time analogue of the world sweep

Three docstrings in this file say the same thing — `MintPaysForTime`'s own, the section note
preceding `applyRule_emitted_world_dichotomy`, and `UnorderedSuccessorLabelClosed`'s obligation
map: *there is no `applyRule_emitted_time_mem`, no statement bounding the times a rule emits at by
`b.knownTimes` with the time-minting rules separated out.* This is that statement.

**Which arm falls to which closer.** The twenty-seven non-minting constructors split five ways:

* *The trigger's own time.* The propositional rules (`andPos` … `negNeg`), the modal-temporal
  bridge `boxTemporal`, the discrete rules `priorUZ` / `priorSZ` / `z1Rule`, the Dedekind rules
  `priorUGap` / `priorSGap` / `sepRule`, `serialityRule`, and `denseIndicatorClosure` all emit at
  `l` itself. Closed by `mem_knownTimes_of_mem hsf`.
* *A constant time carried across a world change.* `boxPos` / `diamondNeg` propagate to
  `b.knownWorlds` at the trigger's time; `boxNeg` / `diamondPos` mint a fresh *world* and carry the
  trigger's time onto it. Closed by `mem_filterMap_const_time_mem` — note the source list ranges
  over worlds, which is why `mem_filterMap_const_time` was stated generically in the element type.
* *A branch formula's own time.* `boxNeg` / `diamondPos`'s `boxPosFormulas` / `diamondNegFormulas`
  auto-propagation blocks relabel branch formulas to the fresh world while keeping their times.
  Closed by `mem_filterMap_time`.
* *An ordering time.* `allFuturePos` / `allPastPos` / `someFutureNeg` / `somePastNeg` propagate to
  every time in `TimeOrdering.futureOf` / `pastOf` of the trigger. Closed by
  `mem_filterMap_futureOf_time` / `mem_filterMap_pastOf_time` — **and only under
  `OrdTimesKnown b ord`**, which is why this theorem carries a hypothesis its world twin does not.
  `applyRule_emitted_time_mem_ordTimesKnown_needed` decides that the hypothesis is not removable.
* *The identification arm.* `timeLinearity` returns whole branches: arms 1 and 2 hand back `b`
  unchanged, arm 3 hands back `b.identifyTime t₂ t₁`. Closed by `mem_knownTimes_of_mem` and
  `mem_identifyTime_time_at_trigger` respectively — the pre-declared fallback of excluding
  `timeLinearity` by hypothesis was **not** needed, because `firstIncomparablePair_spec` already
  discharges the merge target.

`orderTrichotomy` is the one arm that gets its own lemma rather than a line in the sweep: it emits
at the *common predecessor* `t₀`, which is not the trigger's time and reaches the branch only
through the candidate list's `ord.pastOf` source. Extracting that needs a `find?`-to-membership
step the sweep's `first` chain cannot perform by unification alone. -/

/-- `mem_filterMap_const_time` composed with membership of the constant. Stated separately rather
than inlined because the sweep below must run entirely in tactic mode: a term-level `by` block
inside a `first` alternative elaborates with error recovery, so a *failing* side goal would be
silently filled with `sorryAx` and the alternative would appear to succeed. Every closer in the
sweep is therefore a `refine … ?_` whose failure is a real, backtrackable failure. -/

census emits only at times the branch already knows.

The exclusion is carried as `ruleMintsFreshTime rule = false` rather than as a chain of
`rule ≠ …` inequalities: the census is nine rules wide where the world lemma's was two, and the
`Bool` form keeps this signature stable if the census is ever re-derived. `mem_freshTimeRules`
is what ties the `Bool` back to the `Finset`.

**`OrdTimesKnown b ord` is a genuine hypothesis, not a convenience.** Its world twin needs
nothing, because every non-minting rule emits at a world some branch formula already carries.
The time coordinate has no such luck: `allFuturePos` and its three siblings propagate to
`TimeOrdering.futureOf` / `pastOf`, and nothing in `applyRule` ties an ordering time to the
branch. `applyRule_emitted_time_mem_ordTimesKnown_needed` decides a configuration where dropping
the hypothesis makes the statement false. The invariant is available at every consuming site —
it is section A7's, threaded by `ordTimesKnown_expandOnceUnblocked`.

**Footnote, added later.** On the `untl`/`snce`-free fragment the hypothesis is nevertheless
avoidable — not by weakening this statement, which stays exactly as it is, but by an incomparable
one stated beside it in section D3: `applyRule_emitted_time_mem_of_untlSnceFree` trades
`OrdTimesKnown b ord` for `∀ x ∈ b, untlSnceFree x.formula = true`, because the four propagation
arms above and `.orderTrichotomy` are all shape-gated by that condition. The refutation is
untouched: what it refutes is the *unconditional* statement, and its witness branch `[T(G p)]`
carries an `untl` node. -/

The witness: one branch carrying `T(G p)` at the initial label, and an ordering asserting `0 < 5`
with nothing at time `5` on the branch. `allFuturePos` propagates `T(p)` to every time in
`ord.futureOf 0`, hence to time `5`, which `b.knownTimes = [0]` does not contain. The rule is
outside the minting census — it mints no time, it *reads* one off the ordering — so the exclusion
hypothesis is satisfied and the only thing standing between this configuration and a
counterexample is `OrdTimesKnown`, which the witness ordering fails. -/

This is the time coordinate's structural departure from the world coordinate stated as a fact: the

whereas four rules read *times* off the ordering. A reader who removes the hypothesis on the

/-! ### The time dichotomy, and its lift to the engine

The world coordinate is complete because `applyRule_emitted_world_dichotomy` says every emission
sits at a branch world or at `Branch.nextWorld`, with no third case. This subsection closes the
time coordinate the same way. The shape is the same because the *fact* is the same: every fresh
time in `applyRule` is `branch.nextTime`, bound at exactly nine sites, with no `nextTime + k`
anywhere.

The nine minting rules split two ways, and the split is not cosmetic:

* the **six** in `freshTimeRules ∩ freshLabelRules` are *consumable* — they do not re-include their
  trigger — so every one of their emissions is pinned to `Branch.nextTime` outright
  (`applyRule_emitted_nextTime_of_freshLabel`);
* the **three** in `freshTimeRules \ freshLabelRules` re-include the trigger in every arm
  (`untlNeg` and `snceNeg` are `ruleSelfGuarded`; `densityRule` emits alongside branch-carried
  material), so a `= Branch.nextTime` conclusion is *false* for them and the honest statement is
  the disjunction directly. That is why they get their own lemmas rather than joining the group. -/

analogue of `applyRule_boxNeg_emitted_world` / `applyRule_diamondPos_emitted_world`, grouped
because all six share one arm shape: a witness at `freshLabel`, auto-propagation blocks relabelled
to `freshTime`, and a `boxDiamondPersistence` block whose label
`mem_boxDiamondPersistence_label` pins to `{ world := _, time := freshTime }`.

The two hypotheses together name exactly `freshTimeRules ∩ freshLabelRules` =
`{allFutureNeg, allPastNeg, someFuturePos, somePastPos, untlPos, sncePos}`. No `hsf` is needed:
nothing in these arms reaches back to the trigger's own time. -/

`untlNeg` and `snceNeg` re-include their trigger `sf` in **every** arm — that is what
`ruleSelfGuarded` means for them — and `densityRule` emits beside branch-carried material, so none
of the three admits a `= Branch.nextTime` conclusion. What is true is the disjunction, and it needs
`hsf` (for the re-included trigger) where the group lemma above needed nothing.

The three are handled together because their arms differ only in which auto-propagation blocks they
carry, all of which relabel to `freshTime`. `OrdTimesKnown` is *not* needed: unlike the sweep, no
arm here reads a time off the ordering. -/

The exact counterpart of `applyRule_emitted_world_dichotomy`, and assembled the same way: from the
landed sweep (`applyRule_emitted_time_mem`, the 27 non-minting rules) plus the two minting lemmas
(the six consumable ones and the three self-guarded ones), and nothing else. The case split is on
the two `Bool` census predicates rather than on rule names, which is what keeps it nine-and-27
rather than a chain of 36 inequalities.

**It carries `OrdTimesKnown b ord`, and its world twin does not.** The hypothesis enters through
the sweep, not through the minting lemmas — neither of those needs it. See
`applyRule_emitted_time_mem_ordTimesKnown_needed` for why it cannot be dropped, and
`expandOnceUnblocked_ordTimesKnown` for why every consuming site already has it. -/
