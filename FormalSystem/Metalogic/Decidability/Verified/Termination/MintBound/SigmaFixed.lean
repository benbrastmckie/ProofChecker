/-! # The formula-level σ obligation, and the refutation it forces

`FourComponent.lean` stops at `U = ∅` and names the **density** coordinate as what blocks a
nonempty discharge. That account is incomplete, and the missing half is decided here rather than
argued: `MintPaysForTimeStable` is **false** at a concrete nonempty `signedUniverse C L`, at every
frame class and every `Tmax`, with no `densityRule` anywhere near the vehicle.

*Why the density account missed it.* `sigma_time_hit_of_sigmaTimeStable` discharges the σ-hit
obligation `selfGuardPotential` reads, and its own docstring already records that
`mintPotential_lt_of_mint`'s obligation is **not** available the same way — it needs `σ sf = g` on
the nose. Disjunct 2 is the only disjunct that pays for the six rules in
`freshLabelRules ∩ freshTimeRules`, and those rules mint at times whose reach the self-guard
component may already count as cured, so disjunct 3 cannot stand in for it. `SigmaTimeStable`
constrains σ's *times* and nothing else, so a renaming that preserves every label and destroys every
formula satisfies it while pinning `mintPotential` at its ceiling forever.

*The vehicle.* `flatSigma` sends every signed formula to a fixed positive atom **at its own label**.
`witnessPresent`'s match is on `(rule, sign, formula)` and every arm that could fire needs a
temporal or modal shape, so an atom falls through to the catch-all at all thirty-six rules:
`mintPotential U flatSigma b ord = 8 · |U|` at *every* state (`mintPotential_flatSigma`), so
disjunct 2's strict inequality is unavailable at every step of every run. What remains is to find
one step that mints while curing no self-guard column, and `untlPos` at a time whose future is
already non-empty is such a step — it is witness-guarded, so it is exactly one of the six rules
disjunct 2 was carrying.

*What is not claimed.* This does not withdraw anything. `MintPaysForTimeStable`'s direction lemma,
its no-leak confirmation, the four-component measure and the restated termini all stand exactly as
they are; what changes is the reading of the residual they carry, from "open at nonempty `U`, at the
density coordinate" to "false at nonempty `U`, at the formula coordinate, **and** open at the
density coordinate". See register entry 20. -/

/-- **`MintPaysForTimeStable` is false at a concrete nonempty `signedUniverse`**, at every frame
class and every `Tmax`.

The step is `untlPos` firing on the trigger at time `1`; the engine reports a two-arm `.split` and
this is its first arm. On it, all three disjuncts fail on decided numbers:

* disjunct 1 — `knownTimes` goes `{0,1,2}` to `{0,1,2,3}`, so `4 ≤ 3` is false;
* disjunct 2 — `mintPotential` is `8·18 = 144` before **and** after, by `mintPotential_flatSigma`,
  which is a general fact and not a measurement at this configuration;
* disjunct 3 — `selfGuardPotential` is `12` before and `12` after: the step's only new edge is
  `(1, 3)`, time `1`'s future was already non-empty, and no formula of the universe sits at time `3`.

The four frame classes are decided separately, and `Tmax` is universally quantified because
disjunct 1 fails at its first conjunct and disjunct 2 fails by an identity, neither of which
mentions `Tmax`.

Contrast `mintPaysForTime_untlNeg_false`, which refutes the *unrepaired* predicate with a
**self-guarded** vehicle at `σ = id`. That refutation is what the fourth measure component answers.
This one is at a **witness-guarded** vehicle, and what it defeats is the hypothesis
`MintPaysForTimeStable` adds rather than the ledger it adds. -/

/-! #### The formula-level repair: `SigmaFixed`, and the residual restated at it

The refutation above localises the defect precisely — the added hypothesis constrains σ's *times*
where disjunct 2 needs it to constrain σ's *formulas* — so the repair is to state the hypothesis at
the coordinate the obligation lives at, and nowhere else. Nothing else about the predicate changes:
the three disjuncts are the same three, in the same order, with the same conjuncts.

**The repair is free at the arm, which is the whole reason it is available.** `rhoSF src tgt` renames
one time and leaves every other formula strictly alone, so `rhoSF_eq_of_ne_src` is the same one-line
fact as `rhoSF_time_eq_of_ne_src` with the conclusion strengthened from "same time" to "same
formula". Every lemma of the σ layer transcribes across that strengthening with no new content:
`sigmaFixed_identifyOriented` is `sigmaTimeStable_identifyOriented`'s proof verbatim,
`sigmaFormulaFixed_identifyOriented` is `sigmaTimeFixed_identifyOriented`'s, and the watermark
lemmas are `sigmaFixesFrom_*`'s. That the strengthening costs nothing at the one step that changes σ
is a fact about `rhoSF`, not a coincidence, and it is why the repair does not have to be paid for
anywhere downstream: **no figure changes** — `mintPathBoundAt`, `mintAwareFuelAt` and `derivedTmaxAt`
are reused unaltered, unlike the fourth component, which cost a coefficient.

**What is bought.** `sigma_formula_hit_of_sigmaFixed` discharges
`mintPotential_lt_of_mint`'s obligation from confinement alone — the trigger witnesses its own hit,
exactly as `sigma_time_hit_of_sigmaTimeStable` does at the time level — and
`mintPotential_lt_of_pick_linear_sigmaFixed` / `..._branching_sigmaFixed` are that discharge
delivered at the pick, which is where disjunct 2 is actually established. So the added hypothesis is
not inert, and the sense in which it is not is a proved implication rather than a measurement.

**What is not bought.** The density coordinate, unchanged. `densityRule` mints a fresh time while
lying outside both `freshLabelRules` and `selfGuardRules`, so no disjunct moves at a `densityRule`
step whatever σ is; it is `denseRules`-gated, so a discharge restricted to the frame classes outside
`.Dense` / `.RTime` is not refuted, and what such a discharge needs is the rule-by-rule census
register entry 19 names. That census is **not** attempted here. See register entry 20. -/

/-- **`rhoSF` is the identity on a formula away from the retired index** — not merely on its time.
The strengthening of `rhoSF_time_eq_of_ne_src` that the whole formula-level layer rests on, and it
is the same one line: `rho` is a conditional on the time, so off the retired index the record is
rebuilt from its own fields. -/

    (h : sf.label.time ≠ src) : rhoSF src tgt sf = sf := by
  simp [rhoSF, rho, h]

/-- **The formula-level twin of `SigmaTimeStable`**: σ fixes every branch formula outright.

Strictly stronger, and stronger in exactly the respect `mintPotential_lt_of_mint` needs — that
lemma asks for `σ sf = g` on the nose and `SigmaTimeStable` supplies only `(σ sf).label.time =
g.label.time`. `flatSigma_not_sigmaFixed` decides that the gap is real rather than notional. -/

/-- **The residual restated at the formula-level hypothesis.** `MintPaysForTimeStable`'s body
verbatim, with `SigmaTimeStable σ b` exchanged for `SigmaFixed σ b` and nothing else touched — the
same three disjuncts, in the same order, with the same conjuncts.

**The direction.** `SigmaFixed` is stronger than `SigmaTimeStable`, so requiring it makes the
predicate **weaker**: the implication runs `MintPaysForTimeStable → MintPaysForTimeFixed` and never
the other way, and every theorem restated against it is a **strengthening**. This is the
`universeClosedAt_of_universeClosed` idiom for the fourth time in this file, and saying it in words
is not a formality — register entry 7 exists because a weakening was once mistaken for a repair.

**What the exchange buys, and what it costs.** It buys the formula-level σ-hit
(`sigma_formula_hit_of_sigmaFixed`), which is what disjunct 2 needs at the six rules in
`freshLabelRules ∩ freshTimeRules` and which `SigmaTimeStable` provably does not supply
(`mintPaysForTimeStable_signedUniverse_false`). It costs **nothing**: the added hypothesis is
discharged at the seed by `sigmaFormulaFixed_id` and at the identification arm by
`sigmaFormulaFixed_identifyOriented`, no figure changes, and no caller's hypothesis list changes.

**What it does not touch.** The density coordinate. At a `densityRule` step disjunct 1 fails (the
mint raises `knownTimes`), disjunct 2 cannot move (`densityRule ∉ freshLabelRules`) and disjunct 3
cannot move (`densityRule ∉ selfGuardRules`), for every σ whatsoever — so this predicate is
separately refutable at `.Dense` / `.RTime` by a `densityRule` vehicle, and a discharge at the
other frame classes needs the rule-by-rule census register entries 19 and 20 name. That census is
not attempted here, and `gapPotential` remains implemented nowhere and assumed by nothing. -/

per-formula form on the state the arm produces with **no** membership side condition, which is
strictly better than the time-level layer needed. *Preserved*: the arm carries the invariant
forward under exactly the side condition
`universeClosedAt_identify_at_trigger_oriented` already carries.

*And the cost, stated so it can be checked.* Unlike the fourth measure component, which cost a
coefficient in `mintPathBound` and `derivedTmax`, this repair costs **no figure at all**:
`budgetPotentialAt`, `mintPathBoundAt`, `mintAwareFuelAt` and `derivedTmaxAt` are reused byte for
byte by the chain below. -/

/-- **The measure drops at `.extended` and at every arm of a `.split`, at the formula-level
state.** `budgetPotentialAt_step_unordered` re-proved against `MintPaysForTimeFixed`. The three
disjunct cases are byte-identical; the edits are confined to the σ layer — `hstab` is now
`sigmaFixed_of_sigmaFormulaFixed`, and the successor's two clauses come from
`sigmaFormulaFixed_grow_of_fixesFrom` and `sigmaFixesFormulasFrom_mono`, on the same two supplies
(`unorderedSuccessor_time_dichotomy` and `nextTime_monotone_along_run`) the time-level proof uses.

That the transcription is this mechanical is the content of the repair's cost claim: strengthening
the σ hypothesis from times to formulas is free at every step, because `rhoSF` is the identity on
formulas away from the one index it retires. -/

/-! #### The formula-level predicate discharged, and the boundary at which it stops

The boundary is inherited verbatim from `mintPaysForTimeStable_empty`, and for the same reason:
confinement forces the branch empty, the engine reports `.saturated`, and
`unorderedSuccessorBranches` of a `.saturated` result is `[]`. What is **not** inherited is the
refutation — `flatSigma_not_sigmaFixed` decides that the vehicle above does not reach this
predicate, so the boundary is where the discharge currently stops rather than where it is known to
fail.

**What a nonempty discharge needs, precisely, and what is already available.** For the six rules in
`freshLabelRules ∩ freshTimeRules` disjunct 2 is now supplied at the pick, by
`mintPotential_lt_of_pick_linear_sigmaFixed` and `mintPotential_lt_of_pick_branching_sigmaFixed`.
For the two rules of `selfGuardRules` disjunct 3 is supplied by `selfGuardPotential_lt_of_untlNeg`
and `selfGuardPotential_lt_of_snceNeg`, whose σ-hit comes from `SigmaFixed` a fortiori. For the
twenty-seven rules outside `freshTimeRules`, `applyRule_emitted_time_dichotomy` says the step emits
at no new time, which is disjunct 1's first conjunct, and `expandOnceUnblocked_ord_mono` gives the
second. What is missing is the **engine-level assembly**: threading the pick's rule through
`expandOnceUnblocked`'s three stages so that the case split above is available at the successor,
for every rule at once.

**And the one rule none of that reaches.** `densityRule`. It mints a fresh time and lies outside
both `freshLabelRules` and `selfGuardRules`, so no disjunct moves at a `densityRule` step for any σ
whatsoever — the assembly above therefore delivers a discharge only at frame classes where
`denseRules` cannot fire, and the intended second component `gapPotential` (indexed by `U ×ˢ U`,
`denseRules`-gated) remains implemented nowhere and assumed by nothing. Neither the assembly nor
`gapPotential` is attempted here; both are stated as named next steps. See register entry 20.

**Where that boundary has since moved.** Section D3 discharges the predicate — and its unrepaired
original — at every universe of `untl`/`snce`-free formulas, hence at a nonempty
`signedUniverse C L`, at every frame class. Neither the assembly nor `gapPotential` is needed
there, because both are obligations on a time mint and no rule of `freshTimeRules` is applicable to
such a formula: every one of the nine is gated on a shape carrying an `untl` or `snce` node, and
`densityRule` is excluded by that gate before its `Dense ≤ fc` gate is consulted. So what the two
named next steps actually gate is the discharge at a universe carrying a **temporal** operator. -/

Superseded on the `untl`/`snce`-free fragment by
`mintPaysForTimeFixed_signedUniverse_untlSnceFree`, which drops the `L = ∅` restriction entirely;
retained because it is the boundary statement of the empty-universe series and because it holds for
every `C` whatsoever, temporal formulas included. -/
