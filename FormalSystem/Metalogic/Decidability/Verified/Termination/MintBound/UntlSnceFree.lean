/-! # D3. The residual, discharged at a **nonempty** universe: the `untl`/`snce`-free fragment

**What this section delivers.** `MintPaysForTime fc U Tmax` — the predicate this file started from,
not a repair of it — proved outright, at every frame class and every `Tmax`, for every universe
whose formulas carry no `untl` and no `snce` node. Section D2 left the predicate discharged only at
`U = ∅` (`mintPaysForTime_empty`); this section moves the boundary off the empty universe and onto a
syntactic condition that a genuinely nonempty stock satisfies — in particular the whole **modal
fragment**: atoms, `⊥`, `→`, `□`, and everything built from them, which is `S5` over a single
moment sitting inside the bimodal language.

**Why the two blockers section D2 records do not bite here.** They are both blockers on a *time
mint*, and in this fragment no time is ever minted at all:

* *The engine-level assembly.* D2's residual blocker needs the picked rule's identity threaded to
  the successor so a **per-rule payment** (disjunct 2 or 3) can be cashed there. Here no payment is
  ever needed: the argument runs entirely in disjunct 1, and disjunct 1 is uniform in the rule. All
  the pick has to supply is the *negative* fact `ruleMintsFreshTime r = false`, which
  `pick_stage_source_noMint` reads straight off `isApplicable` without destructuring a single rule
  arm.
* *The density coordinate.* `densityRule` is the rule register entries 17 and 20 name as reachable
  by no disjunct for any `σ` whatsoever. It is nonetheless harmless here, and for a reason that is
  worth stating because it is not the frame-class gate: `isApplicable .densityRule sf fc` requires
  `sf.formula` to match `.allFuture _`, and `Formula.allFuture φ` is
  `((⊥ → ⊥) untl (φ → ⊥)) → ⊥` — an `untl` node. So the shape gate rejects it before the
  `Dense ≤ fc` gate is ever consulted, and the discharge below carries **no frame-class
  restriction**. That is strictly better than the "every frame class except `.Dense`/`.RTime`"
  outcome D2's blocker anticipated.

**The shape of the argument, in one line.** Every one of the nine members of `freshTimeRules` is
gated by `isApplicable` on a formula shape that contains an `untl` or an `snce` node
(`allFutureNeg`, `allPastNeg`, `densityRule` through the `allFuture`/`allPast` abbreviations;
`someFuturePos`, `somePastPos`, `untlPos`, `sncePos`, `untlNeg`, `snceNeg` through their `as…?`
views). The engine's other two stages run exactly one rule each — `serialityRule` and
`timeLinearity` — and neither is in the census. So on an `untl`/`snce`-free branch the picked rule
never mints, `applyRule_emitted_time_mem` applies at every emission, and the successor's known
times are a subset of the predecessor's. Both of disjunct 1's conjuncts follow: the cardinality
directly, and the rank because `splitOrderedRank` is monotone in `knownTimes` and antitone in the
constraint list, which `expandOnceUnblocked_ord_mono` only ever extends.

**What this is not.** It is not a discharge at a universe containing a temporal operator, and it
cannot be turned into one: `mintPaysForTime_untlNeg_false` refutes the predicate at a universe whose
formulas are `untl`-headed, so the syntactic condition below is not removable. The two named next
steps of register entry 20 stand unchanged for the temporal fragment. -/

/-- **The syntactic condition**: no `untl` and no `snce` node anywhere in the formula.

Stated on the raw constructors rather than on the `as…?` views, so it is manifestly closed under
subformulas and manifestly satisfied by the modal fragment. It is *sufficient* rather than
necessary — `asUntil?` also rejects `untl ⊤ φ`, and `isApplicable` rejects some shapes this
predicate admits — and sufficiency is all the discharge needs. -/

The nine-arm sweep over `freshTimeRules`, run against `isApplicable`'s own match. Note what does
*not* appear in the proof: no frame class is inspected. `densityRule`'s arm is
`| .densityRule, .pos, .allFuture _ => decide (FrameClass.Dense ≤ fc)`, and the shape half of that
arm already fails, so the `decide` is never reached. This is why the discharge below is universal in

/-! ### The time sweep with `OrdTimesKnown` traded for branch-level freeness

`applyRule_emitted_time_mem` (section D1) carries `OrdTimesKnown b ord`, and
`applyRule_emitted_time_mem_ordTimesKnown_needed` decides that the *unconditional* statement is
false. Neither fact settles what happens on this section's fragment, and the difference matters
downstream: `UniverseClosedAt`'s clause 1 hands over `∀ x ∈ b, x ∈ signedUniverse C L`, from which
branch-level `untlSnceFree` follows in one line, but it hands over nothing at all about the
ordering. A statement whose only currency is branch-level freeness therefore reaches sites the
`OrdTimesKnown` form cannot.

`haux` is consumed at exactly three closer families in the D1 sweep —
`mem_filterMap_futureOf_time haux`, `mem_filterMap_pastOf_time haux`, and (through
`applyRule_orderTrichotomy_emitted_time`) `mem_knownTimes_of_mem_pastOf haux` — spread across
exactly five rule arms. All five are shape-gated, and the five lemmas below say so one arm at a
time. Four are gated by the *trigger*: `.allFuturePos` and `.allPastPos` match the raw
`Formula.allFuture` / `Formula.allPast` shape, whose head is an `untl` / `snce` node, and
`.someFutureNeg` / `.somePastNeg` consult `asSomeFuture?` / `asSomePast?`, which the view lemmas
above already return `none` for. The fifth is gated by the *branch*: `.orderTrichotomy`'s `fires`
guard demands `branch.contains (SignedFormula.neg d l0)` for one of three `Formula.someFuture`-headed
disjuncts, and an `untl`/`snce`-free branch carries no `untl`-headed formula at all. That asymmetry
is why the restricted sweep takes a branch-level hypothesis rather than a trigger-level one.

Each exclusion concludes `emitted = []` rather than the weaker "every emission is at a known time":
on this fragment the four propagation arms and the trichotomy arm do not merely emit safely, they
do not fire. -/

/-- `.allFuturePos` does not fire on an `untl`/`snce`-free trigger. Its arm matches the raw shape
`Formula.allFuture ψ = ((⊥ → ⊥) untl (ψ → ⊥)) → ⊥`, so the condition has to be pushed through the
implication before the `untl` node is visible — the same extra split
`asAllFuture_eq_none_of_untlSnceFree` needs, and for the same reason. Routing through that view
lemma is not available here: `applyRule`'s arm is a constructor pattern, not a view. -/

/-- **The time sweep on the `untl`/`snce`-free fragment, without `OrdTimesKnown`.**

`applyRule_emitted_time_mem` with `haux : OrdTimesKnown b ord` replaced by
`hbfree : ∀ x ∈ b, untlSnceFree x.formula = true`. Three things about it, and no more:

* **It is incomparable to the original, not stronger.** It trades a semantic run invariant for a
  syntactic branch condition. Neither hypothesis implies the other: an ordering can be
  `OrdTimesKnown` over a branch carrying `untl` formulas, and an `untl`/`snce`-free branch can sit
  under an ordering reaching times it does not know. Both statements are needed, and both are kept.
* **It does not contradict `applyRule_emitted_time_mem_ordTimesKnown_needed`.** What that theorem
  refutes is the *unconditional* statement — no `OrdTimesKnown`, no syntactic condition, nothing.
  Its witness branch is `[T(G p)]`, and `Formula.allFuture p` is an `untl` node, so the witness
  fails `hbfree` outright. The refutation stands exactly as stated.
* **The five arms that consume `OrdTimesKnown` are precisely the five the syntactic hypothesis
  shape-gates**: `.allFuturePos` and `.allPastPos` (raw `allFuture` / `allPast` constructor
  patterns), `.someFutureNeg` and `.somePastNeg` (the `asSomeFuture?` / `asSomePast?` views), and
  `.orderTrichotomy` (the `fires` guard's branch lookup). The five exclusions above are inserted
  into the sweep's `first` chain *ahead of* the closers that would have needed `haux`, and the
  `mem_filterMap_futureOf_time` / `mem_filterMap_pastOf_time` alternatives are then simply absent:
  no arm reaches them. Every other arm is closed by the D1 sweep's own `haux`-free alternatives,
  copied verbatim so that the ordering property that script's docstring records — every closer a
  backtrackable `refine … ?_`, never a term-level `by` that could absorb a failing goal into
  `sorryAx` — is preserved.

`hmint : ruleMintsFreshTime rule = false` is retained. It is plausibly droppable on this fragment,
since an `untl`/`snce`-free trigger fails every minting rule's shape view
(`isApplicable_eq_false_of_untlSnceFree`), but `applyRule` is not gated by `isApplicable`, so
dropping it is a separate proof and not one this statement needs. -/

needs, so the `haux`-free form is strictly stronger at no new cost.

This is the declaration section D4's boundary block said would be needed and did not have. Its point
is not economy — the original's `haux` is available at every site that currently consumes it, via
`hri.ordTimesKnown` — but *reachability*: `UniverseClosedAt`'s clause 1 quantifies `ord` universally
and unconstrained, so it can never supply `OrdTimesKnown b ord`, while branch-level freeness follows
from clause 1's own `∀ x ∈ b, x ∈ signedUniverse C L` in one line.

The original is retained with its signature byte-identical and its proof untouched: it is cited by
name in this section's prose and in D4's boundary block, and `mintPaysForTime_of_untlSnceFree` and
its three descendants continue to consume it unchanged. -/

asserted. Two facts: the universe is nonempty whenever both its dimensions are, and a concrete

condition. -/

/-- **Seed-level terminus 2, with the mint residual discharged rather than assumed.**

The exact statement of `buildTableauAt_isSome_at_seed_lengthBudget_signedUniverse_fixed` with its
`hmint` argument gone: on an `untl`/`snce`-free stock the hypothesis is a theorem, so the terminus
carries one named residual fewer. The other three (`UnorderedSuccessorLabelClosed`,
`StepLengthBounded`, `PostBlockingSettles`) are untouched — this section says nothing about them.

**But read the reach honestly: `hlab` makes this statement vacuous wherever the universe is not
empty.** The section heading promises a discharge "at a **nonempty** universe", and the `hmint`
half of that promise is kept. The `hlab` half is not, and cannot be:
`unorderedSuccessorLabelClosed_nonempty_false` refutes `hlab` at every nonempty finite `L`, so at
exactly the `L` this section is interested in, the theorem above is a true conditional with a false
antecedent. It is the failure mode `DifficultyBounded` fell into and that `timeMergeClosed_product`
was added to rule out — a residual nobody can satisfy makes its theorem a true conditional with no
reach. What removes `hlab` is not a better proof of this theorem but a **replacement** for the
predicate — a condition that is actually satisfiable at a nonempty `L`. No artifact should read this
theorem, or any of the eight siblings that carry `hlab`, as claiming a discharge at a nonempty
universe until `hlab` is absent from the signature. -/
