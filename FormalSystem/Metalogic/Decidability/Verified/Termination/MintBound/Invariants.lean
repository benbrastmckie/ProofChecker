The mirror of `irreflOrd_addFuture`: `TimeOrdering.addPast t t_new` conses `(t_new, t)` rather

fresh-time mint sites in `applyRule` build their ordering this way. -/

Same three steps at the converse step relation: `bfsClosure_sound` extracts a backward path of
between one and `100` edges, `PathN.reverse` turns it into a forward path of the same length
against `mem_directFutureOf_iff` read right-to-left, and `bfsClosure_complete` re-finds it at the
same default fuel. Both closures run at fuel `100`, so the length soundness bounds is exactly the

/-- **R1, decided: `incomparableB` is symmetric.** Incomparability is a symmetric relation even
though `firstIncomparablePair`'s test — which `incomparableB` transcribes verbatim — is written
asymmetrically, as three conditions on the *ordered* pair.

The two closure conjuncts trade places under the duality rather than being preserved: `t₁ ∈
futureOf t₂` would give `t₂ ∈ pastOf t₁` by `orderDual_holds`, contradicting the *past* conjunct,
and `t₁ ∈ pastOf t₂` would give `t₂ ∈ futureOf t₁` by `orderDual_backward`, contradicting the
*future* one. That crossing is why both directions of the duality are needed and why only having
one of them is what made this look like a risk.

false, Candidate A would have died here and the ladder would have resumed at Candidate B. -/

/-! ### `IrreflOrd` is NECESSARY, not merely convenient

`TimeOrdering.identifyTime` drops **every** constraint that collapses, including a pre-existing
self-loop `(a, a)` with `a ∉ {src, tgt}` — its two components rename to the same index. So a
witness reachable only around a self-loop is destroyed by the identification arm, and the
`IrreflOrd`-free form of `witnessPresent_identifyTime` is **false**, not merely unproved.

The four examples below are the machine-checked record of that. They belong on the
do-not-re-attempt register: a future reader who takes `IrreflOrd` for a cosmetic hypothesis and
drops it will be re-attempting a refuted statement. -/

/-- A self-loop carries reachability before identification. -/
example : (5 : TimeIndex) ∈ (TimeOrdering.mk [(5, 5)]).futureOf 5 := by decide

/-- …and that reachability is gone after it, because the self-loop is dropped. -/
example : (5 : TimeIndex) ∉ ((TimeOrdering.mk [(5, 5)]).identifyTime 1 0).futureOf 5 := by decide

/-- The incomparability side condition still holds in that configuration, so the failure is
attributable to the self-loop alone rather than to a violated trigger guarantee. -/
example : incomparableB (TimeOrdering.mk [(5, 5)]) (0, 1) = true := by decide

/-- **Counterexample to the `IrreflOrd`-free form of witness preservation.** With the
irreflexivity hypothesis dropped, `witnessPresent` for `allFutureNeg` is `true` before the
identification and `false` after it. -/
theorem witnessPresent_identifyTime_unconditional_false :
    letI p : Formula := .atom ⟨"p", none⟩
    letI sf : SignedFormula := ⟨.neg, Formula.allFuture p, ⟨0, 5⟩⟩
    letI wit : SignedFormula := ⟨.neg, p, ⟨0, 5⟩⟩
    letI b : Branch := [sf, wit]
    letI ord : TimeOrdering := ⟨[(5, 5)]⟩
    witnessPresent .allFutureNeg sf b ord = true ∧
      witnessPresent .allFutureNeg ⟨.neg, Formula.allFuture p, ⟨0, rho 1 0 5⟩⟩
        (b.identifyTime 1 0) (ord.identifyTime 1 0) = false := by

/-! ## A2. `applyRule` preserves `IrreflOrd` -/

/-- A branch formula never sits at the branch's fresh time. This is the single freshness fact
every mint site reduces to, read off `not_mem_of_time_nextTime` contrapositively. -/
theorem time_ne_nextTime {b : Branch} {sf : SignedFormula} (h : sf ∈ b) :
    sf.label.time ≠ b.nextTime := fun hc => not_mem_of_time_nextTime hc h

set_option maxHeartbeats 4000000 in
/-- **Every rule except `densityRule` preserves ordering irreflexivity.**

`applyRule` mints a fresh time at exactly nine sites, all of the shape
`freshTime := branch.nextTime` followed by a single ordering edge between `sf.label.time` and
`freshTime` — five via `TimeOrdering.addFuture` and four via `TimeOrdering.addPast`. Each
reduces to `irreflOrd_addFuture` / `irreflOrd_addPast` applied to the one freshness fact
`time_ne_nextTime`. Every other rule threads the input ordering through unchanged, including
`timeLinearity`, whose `.branchingOrdered` result carries the per-arm orderings in the *result*
and returns the input ordering in the second component; the per-arm orderings are handled at
engine level rather than here.

`densityRule` is excluded because it is the sole **two-edge** site: it builds
`(ord.addFuture l.time freshTime).addFuture freshTime t'`, and the second edge needs
`freshTime ≠ t'`, which does not follow from freshness alone.

The `contradiction` alternative is load-bearing rather than defensive. `applyRule` is written as
one `match` over three discriminants with overlapping patterns, so `split` emits the arms of
*every* rule in each rule's case, each carrying a false discriminant equation such as
`TableauRule.impPos = TableauRule.densityRule`; `contradiction` is what discharges those
unreachable arms. It also discharges the genuine `densityRule` case from `hrule`. -/

The twelve lemmas below are what make witness preservation across the identification arm work.

/-! ## A3. `densityRule` and the ordering-times invariant

`densityRule` is the sole two-edge mint site. Its second edge runs from the fresh time to a
target `t'` drawn from `ord.futureOf l.time`, so irreflexivity there needs `t' ≠ freshTime`,
which freshness alone does not give. The auxiliary invariant below is what supplies it: if every
time the ordering mentions is a time the branch already knows, then `t'` sits at or below
`b.maxTime`, strictly below the fresh time. -/

`Branch.maxTime` is a `foldl max`, and the two facts the preservation proof needs — that it is

are not exported by `Tableau.lean` (`le_foldl_max` / `mem_le_foldl_max` there are `private`), so
the `≤`-direction is re-proved locally. -/

/-! ## A4. The pick bridges, carrying the ordering

`Fuel.lean`'s `findApplicable{,Serial,Linearity}Rule_applyRule_eq` report only the *result*
component of the pick. Lifting `applyRule_irreflOrd` to engine level needs the *ordering*
component too, since `expandOnceUnblocked` hands the pick's third component on as the step's new
ordering. These are the same three extraction lemmas strengthened to the full pair. -/

/-! ## A5. Engine-level `IrreflOrd`, all four result shapes

`expandOnceUnblocked` hands the pick's third component on as the step's new ordering, and that
component is `(applyRule r sf b ord).2` at each of the three pick stages. So the engine-level
statement is `applyRule_irreflOrd` composed with the three pick bridges of A4, with `sf ∈ b`
coming from `List.mem_of_find?_eq_some` at each stage. -/

/-- The ordering a pick hands on: the input ordering when nothing was picked, and the picked
rule's own new ordering otherwise. -/
def pickOrd (ord : TimeOrdering) :
    Option (TableauRule × RuleResult × TimeOrdering) → TimeOrdering
  | none => ord
  | some (_, _, o) => o

/-- The second component of `expandOnceUnblocked`'s result-tail is `pickOrd`, uniformly across
all five `RuleResult` shapes. Stated over an abstract `pick` for the same reason `pick_extended`
is: a hypothesis about the three-stage `match` as a whole is not something the per-stage lemmas
can consume. -/

/-- **Engine-level irreflexivity, all four `ExpansionResult` shapes.** The step's ordering
component is irreflexive whichever shape the step reports: `.saturated` threads the input
ordering through, `.extended` and `.split` hand the picked rule's ordering on unchanged, and
`.splitOrdered` returns the input ordering in this component (its per-arm orderings are the
subject of `expandOnceUnblocked_splitOrdered_irreflOrd` below).

`.split` needs nothing further: a `.branching` step hands the *same* ordering to every arm, so
this one statement covers every arm of a split. -/
