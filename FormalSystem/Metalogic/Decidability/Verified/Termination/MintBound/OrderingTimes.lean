/-! # A6. `OrdTimesLeMaxTime` at the branching shapes

This is the mirrored half of R1. A `.branching` step hands the *same* new ordering to every arm,
so an arm whose formula list omitted the fresh witness would hold an ordering edge to a time
absent from its own branch, and that arm's `nextTime` could then collide with the minted time.

The reading of the four branching mint sites is that this does not happen: `untlPos`, `sncePos`,
and the ACTIVE arms of `untlNeg` and `snceNeg` all build **both** arms at `freshLabel`, so each
arm's head already sits at the fresh time and dominates it. That reading is what the proof below
discharges — the `rfl` supplied for `hg` in each mint case is exactly the claim "this arm's head
sits at `b.nextTime`". -/

/-! ### `OrdTimesLeMaxTime` is REFUTED at the ordered split's identification arm

The statement above stops at `.extended` and `.split` for a reason that is a **fact, not a gap**.
`Branch.identifyTime t₂ t₁` can *lower* `Branch.maxTime` — it does so exactly when `t₂` was the
branch's largest time and `t₁` is smaller — while `TimeOrdering.identifyTime` leaves any
constraint not mentioning `t₂` completely untouched. A constraint whose times sit strictly
between `t₁` and `t₂` therefore survives the arm while the bound it was measured against drops
below it.

The refuting configuration below is machine-checked, and it belongs on the do-not-re-attempt
register alongside `witnessPresent_identifyTime_unconditional_false`: a future reader who assumes
`OrdTimesLeMaxTime` is a run invariant across *every* engine step will be re-attempting a refuted
statement.

**What this does and does not say.** It says the invariant *as defined* is not preserved by the
identification arm. It does not say the configuration is reachable from `initialBranch` — the
constraint `(3, 4)` mentions two times no formula on the branch carries, and every ordering edge
the engine actually builds runs between a branch time and a freshly minted one. Closing that gap
needs a **strictly stronger** invariant ("every ordering time is a *known branch time*", not
merely "≤ `maxTime`"), which is preserved at the arm because `rho` maps known times to known
times. That strengthening is not made here: `OrdTimesLeMaxTime` is what the landed density and
non-branching results already consume, and changing it would reopen them. -/

/-- **Counterexample: the identification arm does not preserve `OrdTimesLeMaxTime`.**

All four conjuncts are decided. The first three establish that the configuration is a *genuine*
ordered-split trigger satisfying both standing hypotheses — the ordering is irreflexive, the
invariant holds before the step, and `firstIncomparablePair` really does select `(0, 5)` — so the
failure in the fourth conjunct is attributable to the arm itself rather than to a violated
precondition. The branch's largest time `5` is the one identified away, and the surviving
constraint `(3, 4)` then exceeds the collapsed `maxTime` of `0`. -/

/-! ## A7. `OrdTimesKnown` — the strengthened ordering-times invariant

### Do-not-re-attempt

The preservation of `OrdTimesLeMaxTime` across the ordered split's identification arm is
**REFUTED**, not merely unproved: `ordTimes_identifyTime_arm3_false` just above decides a
configuration in which both standing hypotheses hold, `firstIncomparablePair` really does fire,
and the invariant nonetheless fails after the arm. A reader who assumes `OrdTimesLeMaxTime` is a
run invariant across *every* engine step — or who later "simplifies" the run invariant back to the
`≤ maxTime` form — is re-attempting a refuted statement.

The settled repair is `OrdTimesKnown` below, with `ordTimesKnown_identifyTime` supplying the arm-3
preservation the weak form cannot have. `ordTimesLeMaxTime_of_ordTimesKnown` records that this is a
**strengthening** rather than a weakening: every landed `OrdTimesLeMaxTime` result stays true, stays
in source, and stays reachable.

Root cause of the refutation, restated so the repair is legible: `Branch.identifyTime` measures the
ordering against a bound (`Branch.maxTime`) that the arm is free to move *downward* underneath a
surviving constraint. Membership in `Branch.knownTimes` has no such defect, because the arm relabels
the branch and the ordering by the **same** function `rho`, so the two move together. -/

/-- **The strengthened ordering-times invariant**: every time mentioned by the ordering is a
*known branch time*, rather than merely `≤ b.maxTime`.

This strengthens `OrdTimesLeMaxTime`, and `ordTimesLeMaxTime_of_ordTimesKnown` is the witness —
the weak form is derivable from this one, so every landed `OrdTimesLeMaxTime` consumer keeps
working and none of its producers is disturbed. The strengthening is necessary rather than
cosmetic: the weak form is **refuted** at the ordered split's identification arm by
`ordTimes_identifyTime_arm3_false`, while this form survives it unconditionally
(`ordTimesKnown_identifyTime`). -/
def OrdTimesKnown (b : Branch) (ord : TimeOrdering) : Prop :=
  ∀ p ∈ ord.constraints, p.1 ∈ b.knownTimes ∧ p.2 ∈ b.knownTimes

/-! ### Basic `knownTimes` facts -/

/-- A branch formula's time is a known time. -/
theorem mem_knownTimes_of_mem {b : Branch} {sf : SignedFormula} (h : sf ∈ b) :
    sf.label.time ∈ b.knownTimes := by
  simp only [Branch.knownTimes, List.mem_eraseDups, List.mem_map]
  exact ⟨sf, h, rfl⟩

/-- Conversely, a known time is carried by some branch formula. -/
theorem exists_mem_of_mem_knownTimes {b : Branch} {t : TimeIndex} (h : t ∈ b.knownTimes) :
    ∃ sf ∈ b, sf.label.time = t := by
  simp only [Branch.knownTimes, List.mem_eraseDups, List.mem_map] at h
  obtain ⟨sf, hsf, hEq⟩ := h
  exact ⟨sf, hsf, hEq⟩

/-- A known time is at or below `maxTime`. -/
theorem le_maxTime_of_mem_knownTimes {b : Branch} {t : TimeIndex} (h : t ∈ b.knownTimes) :
    t ≤ b.maxTime := by
  obtain ⟨sf, hsf, rfl⟩ := exists_mem_of_mem_knownTimes h
  exact le_maxTime hsf

/-- **The strengthening witness.** The strong invariant implies the weak one.

This is what makes the move to `OrdTimesKnown` a *strengthening* rather than the forbidden
weakening: every landed `OrdTimesLeMaxTime` consumer — `applyRule_irreflOrd` above chief among
them — keeps working unchanged, reached from the strong form through this one lemma. None of the
weak form's four producer lemmas is deleted, renamed, or restated; they remain true and simply go
unused by the strong chain. -/
theorem ordTimesLeMaxTime_of_ordTimesKnown {b : Branch} {ord : TimeOrdering}
    (h : OrdTimesKnown b ord) : OrdTimesLeMaxTime b ord := fun p hp =>
  ⟨le_maxTime_of_mem_knownTimes (h p hp).1, le_maxTime_of_mem_knownTimes (h p hp).2⟩

/-- **The refuting configuration dies under the strengthened invariant.**

The exact branch and ordering that refute `OrdTimesLeMaxTime` preservation at the identification
arm (`ordTimes_identifyTime_arm3_false` above) fail `OrdTimesKnown` at their *input*: the
constraint `(3, 4)` mentions two times no formula on the branch carries. So the counterexample
does not transfer, and the strengthening is not merely a different statement but a live repair. -/
theorem counterexample_dies :
    letI p : Formula := .atom ⟨"p", none⟩
    letI q : Formula := .atom ⟨"q", none⟩
    letI b : Branch := [⟨.pos, p, ⟨0, 0⟩⟩, ⟨.pos, q, ⟨0, 5⟩⟩]

/-! ### Arm-3 preservation — the crux

`Branch.identifyTime` relabels by `rho src tgt`; `TimeOrdering.identifyTime` relabels its
constraint components by the same function. So the two move together, and membership survives. -/

/-- The branch half of the renaming acts on known times exactly as `rho` does. -/

/-- **Arm-3 preservation.** `OrdTimesKnown` IS preserved by the ordered split's identification arm.

Note it needs **no trigger hypotheses at all** — not `firstIncomparablePair`, not `IrreflOrd`. It
is a pure structural fact about branch and ordering being relabelled by the same `rho`, which is
strictly better than the weak form: `ordTimes_identifyTime_arm3_false` shows the weak form fails
here even *with* both hypotheses in hand. -/

/-- **The initial condition.** The strong invariant holds at the engine's seed ordering.

This is **vacuously true, and the vacuity is a property of the seed rather than of a narrowed
statement**: `TimeOrdering.empty` is defined with `constraints := []`, and every engine run starts
there — both `buildTableauAt` and `buildTableau` call `expandBranchWithFuel` with
`TimeOrdering.empty` as the initial ordering. So there is no constraint to check, for any branch
whatsoever.

The distinction matters enough to state. A later reader meeting a base case that discharges by
`simp` must be able to tell, without re-deriving anything, that nothing was weakened to make it
close. The base case is vacuous; the inductive step — `applyRule_ordTimesKnown_nonbranching`,
`ordTimesKnown_splitOrdered_arms12`, and `ordTimesKnown_identifyTime` — carries all the content,
and none of those three is vacuous. -/

/-! ### `OrdTimesKnown` at the branching shapes and at engine level

The weak engine-level twins just above — `applyRule_ordTimes_branching`, `pickBranches_ordTimes`,
`expandOnceUnblocked_ordTimes`, `expandOnceUnblocked_irreflOrd` — are **retained and still true**.
They are not superseded in the sense of being wrong; they are what the strong forms compose
through, and `expandOnceUnblocked_irreflOrd_of_known` below is literally one line of composition
over `expandOnceUnblocked_irreflOrd`.

The strong forms exist for one reason only: the weak invariant is **not carryable across the
ordered split's identification arm**, by `ordTimes_identifyTime_arm3_false`. An engine-level
statement threaded through `OrdTimesLeMaxTime` therefore cannot become a run invariant, however
many result shapes it covers. -/

the ordering-unchanged case discharged by `ordTimesKnown_mono … sub_append` where the weak form
used `ordTimes_mono … (maxTime_le_append _ _)`. Branch growth is identical: every arm is `fs ++ b`.

As with the weak twin, the `.branchingOrdered` shape is deliberately not covered here — its
per-arm orderings live in the *result* rather than the second component, so it is handled at
engine level where the arm list is visible. -/

/-! ## A8. The run invariant

This section closes the obligation the weak invariant could not meet.

`OrdTimesLeMaxTime` is **refuted** at the ordered split's identification arm
(`ordTimes_identifyTime_arm3_false`), so no amount of engine-level plumbing could have made the
pair `(IrreflOrd, OrdTimesLeMaxTime)` into a run invariant: a single ordered split destroys the
second component, and `IrreflOrd`'s own preservation at `applyRule` consumes it. The repair is
`ordTimesKnown_identifyTime`, which survives that same arm **unconditionally** — with neither the
`firstIncomparablePair` trigger nor `IrreflOrd` in hand — because branch and ordering are relabelled
by the same `rho`.

With arm 3 supplied, all three ordered-split arms close (`ordTimesKnown_splitOrdered_arms12` for
arms 1-2), and `RunInvariant` below is carryable across **every** expansion step. -/

/-- **The ordered split preserves `OrdTimesKnown` at all three arms** — the deliverable the
strengthening exists for.

`expandOnceUnblocked_splitOrdered_shape` supplies the exact three-arm list together with the
trigger. Arms 1-2 keep the branch literally and add one edge between the incomparable pair, closed
by `ordTimesKnown_splitOrdered_arms12` from the trigger alone; arm 3 is `ordTimesKnown_identifyTime`,
which needs neither the trigger nor `IrreflOrd`. -/

/-! ## B5. Engine-level growth, and one-step witness preservation

The two monotonicity lemmas above are stated against **abstract** growth hypotheses. Applying them
at an expansion step needs both growth facts supplied at engine level, and only one of the two was
available:

* **Branch growth** — `expandOnceUnblocked_split_subset` covers `.split`, and the `.extended`
  shape is `fs ++ b`; `expandOnceUnblocked_extended_shape` below records that shape and
  `expandOnceUnblocked_branch_mono` joins the two.
* **Ordering growth** — nothing like it was landed. `applyRule_ord_mono` proves it at rule level
  by the same case analysis the invariant lemmas use, and `expandOnceUnblocked_ord_mono` lifts it
  through the three pick stages.

Arm 3 of the ordered split is the one place where **neither** growth fact holds: the ordering is
*relabelled* there rather than extended, and the branch is `Branch.identifyTime`, which is not a
superset of the branch it came from. That arm is supplied instead by `arm3_preserves_witness`, and
it is why the `.splitOrdered` half of the statement below carries a disjunction over the
renaming. -/

/-- **`applyRule` never deletes an ordering constraint.**

Every rule either hands `ord` straight back, or prepends one edge (`addFuture` at the five forward
mint sites, `addPast` at the four backward ones), or prepends two (`densityRule`). `timeLinearity`

before: the landed `addFuture_constraints_mono` is a fact about one `TimeOrdering` operation, not
about `applyRule`'s ordering component. -/

/-- **One expansion step preserves a present witness**, across all four `ExpansionResult` shapes.

The first conjunct covers `.extended` (one successor) and `.split` (its arms), which share the
step's own ordering: the branch only grows (`expandOnceUnblocked_branch_mono`) and the ordering only
grows (`expandOnceUnblocked_ord_mono`), so the two monotonicity lemmas compose.

The second conjunct covers `.splitOrdered`, whose per-arm orderings live inside the result. Arms 1
and 2 keep the branch literally and add one edge between the incomparable pair, so ordering
monotonicity alone suffices; **arm 3** relabels both branch and ordering, and is
`arm3_preserves_witness` — which is why the arm-3 disjunct is about `rhoSF t₂ t₁ sf` rather than
`sf`. That renaming is not a weakening: it is the same formula carried along the identification the
arm performs, and it is the same form in which
`expandOnceUnblocked_splitOrdered_no_deletion` states non-deletion.

`.saturated` produces no successor branch and satisfies both conjuncts by absence of successors,
not by any weakening of the statement.

`RunInvariant` enters for one reason only: arm 3's `IrreflOrd` side condition. Both monotonicity
lemmas are invariant-free. -/

/-- **`witnessPresent` never flips `true → false` along a run**, up to the arm-3 renaming — the
corollary in the form the mint counting consumes.

Contrapositive of `expandOnceUnblocked_preserves_witness`. Read forwards: if a successor reports no
witness then the step it came from reported none either. At an ordered split, "the successor
reports no witness" has to mean *both* the formula and its arm-3 rename report none — that is what
makes the statement true at arm 3 rather than merely unrefuted there.

Stated against `RunInvariant` rather than a standalone `IrreflOrd` hypothesis, so a fuel induction
carrying the single bundled invariant can consume it directly. -/
