/-! # D4. The label residual, **replaced**: the `boxFree` shape gate and the world coordinate

**What this section delivers.** A route to clause 1 at `signedUniverse C L`, and to a seed-level
terminus, that carries **no** `UnorderedSuccessorLabelClosed` hypothesis at all. Section C11 proves
that residual false at every nonempty finite `L` (`unorderedSuccessorLabelClosed_nonempty_false`),
so the nine theorems that assume it are vacuously true at exactly the universes anyone cares about.
A *discharge* of it is therefore not available and never was — it is not a hard lemma, it is a false
statement. What is available is a **replacement**: a different hypothesis, satisfiable at a nonempty
`L` and discharged rather than assumed, bought at the price of a syntactic restriction on the stock.

**Why the replacement has to bite on the stock and not on `L`.** `freshWorldHeadroom_not_universal`
proves that for no nonempty finite `L` does every `L`-confined branch have the headroom: each
enlargement of `L` raises the reachable `maxWorld` at least as much as it adds, so the gap re-opens.
Every `L`-side repair is refuted before it is written. The one remaining place to intervene is
**before the world-minting rules can fire at all**, and that means a condition on the formulas a
branch may carry.

**Why exactly two rules have to be stopped.** `applyRule_emitted_world_mem` bounds the worlds a rule
emits at by `b.worldFinset` under exactly two hypotheses, `rule ≠ .boxNeg` and `rule ≠ .diamondPos`.
Those two inequalities *are* the world-minting census — there is no third rule, and if there were,
`findApplicableRule_not_worldMinting`'s conclusion below would be incomplete rather than merely
weak. `boxFree` closes both at the **shape gate**: `.boxNeg` is gated by `isApplicable`'s
`| .boxNeg, .neg, .box _ => true` arm, and `.diamondPos` by `asDiamond? φ`, whose only matching
pattern is itself built from a `.box` node. A branch carrying no `.box` anywhere can have neither
picked, at any frame class and any tracker.

**No frame-class restriction, for the same structural reason as D3.** The exclusion happens at the
shape gate, before `isApplicable` consults any `fc`-dependent gate, so nothing in this section
quantifies `fc` away or restricts it.

**What this is not — read this before citing anything below.** The terminus this section builds
combines `boxFree` with D3's `untlSnceFree`, and the two together collapse the stock to the **purely
propositional fragment**: atoms, `⊥`, `→`, and nothing else. That is a severe narrowing, and it is
**forced rather than a proof weakness**. `freshWorldHeadroom_not_universal` rules out every `L`-side
alternative, so the only handle is the stock; and stopping `.boxNeg` and `.diamondPos` at the stock
means excluding `□` outright, since both are gated on a `.box` node. No artifact may read this
section as a discharge over the modal fragment, as a general discharge, or as superseding D3's
reach: D3's `MintPaysForTime` result covers the whole modal fragment **including** `□`, and this
section does not. What this section adds is orthogonal to D3 — it removes a *false* hypothesis from
a terminus, at the one fragment where removing it is possible. -/

/-- **The syntactic condition**: no `.box` node anywhere in the formula.

Stated on the raw constructors rather than on the `asDiamond?` view, for the same reason
`untlSnceFree` is: it is then manifestly closed under subformulas and manifestly checkable on a
concrete stock by `rfl`. Like `untlSnceFree` it is *sufficient* rather than necessary — `asDiamond?`
also rejects `.box`-bearing shapes this predicate excludes outright — and sufficiency is all the
replacement needs. -/

/-- **The `◇` view is empty on a `boxFree` formula.** `asDiamond? φ` matches only the shape whose
body is a `.box` node, so a formula with no `.box` anywhere cannot present as a diamond. This is the
half of the census that is *not* visible from `isApplicable`'s own pattern match, which is why it is
stated separately. -/

threads to the successor.

The conclusion is stated as the pair of inequalities `applyRule_emitted_world_mem` asks for, rather
than as a `ruleMintsFreshLabel` fact, because that lemma's hypotheses are the authoritative census:
`.boxNeg` and `.diamondPos` are the only two rules that can emit outside `b.worldFinset`, and both
are gated on a `.box` node — the first by `isApplicable`'s own pattern, the second through
`asDiamond?`. This is the structural reason the whole route carries no frame-class restriction: the
shape gate is consulted before any `fc`-dependent gate. -/

/-! ### The world-subset machinery, mirroring D3's time machinery

Three declarations, in the same order and the same shapes as `pick_stage_source_noMint`,
`pickBranches_knownTimes_subset` and `unorderedSuccessor_knownTimes_subset`. The mirror is
**strictly simpler than its template** in one respect worth naming rather than leaving a reader to
wonder about: `applyRule_emitted_world_mem` carries no `OrdTimesKnown b ord` hypothesis where
`applyRule_emitted_time_mem` does, so none of the three below takes one either. The asymmetry is
real and is recorded at `applyRule_emitted_time_mem_ordTimesKnown_needed`: the time sweep needs the
ordering's times to be branch-known because `timeLinearity` reads times off `ord`, whereas nothing
reads *worlds* off the ordering at all.

**Footnote, added later.** The asymmetry is real but it is not permanent on this fragment:
`unorderedSuccessor_knownTimes_subset_of_untlSnceFree` (section D3) is the time-coordinate mirror
without the run invariant, and the boundary block at the end of this section records what that
buys. -/

/-- **`pick_stage_source` with the no-world-mint fact attached**, the world-coordinate counterpart
of `pick_stage_source_noMint`. The three stages differ only in how the fact arrives: stage one has
it from `findApplicableRule_not_worldMinting`; stages two and three run exactly one rule each
(`serialityRule` via `findApplicableSerialRule_rule`, `timeLinearity` via
`findApplicableLinearityRule_rule`), and neither is `.boxNeg` or `.diamondPos`, so both close on the
rule identity alone. -/

hypothesis. That closure is precisely what no condition on `L` could ever buy —
`freshWorldHeadroom_not_universal` refutes every such attempt — and it is why the replacement route
has to restrict the stock.

Routed through `pick_branches_eq` and `pick_stage_source_noWorldMint`, so the three-stage pick is not
destructured a second time. Carries no frame-class restriction and no `OrdTimesKnown`. -/

/-! ### The composite: clause 1's label dimension at the propositional fragment

The two per-coordinate subset facts, joined by the rectangle. This is the same assembly as
`unorderedSuccessor_label_mem_of_headroom`, with one decisive difference: there the four quadrants
are paid for by `FreshLabelHeadroom L b`, which `freshLabelHeadroom_not_universal` refutes at every
nonempty finite `L`; here they are paid for by `TimeMergeClosed L`, which `timeMergeClosed_product`
exhibits at every rectangle. The hypothesis is satisfiable, and that is the entire point of the
exercise. -/

/-- **Clause 1's label dimension, discharged from satisfiable hypotheses.** Every formula on every
unordered successor of an `L`-confined `boxFree`, `untl`/`snce`-free branch sits at a label of `L`.

**How the four quadrants are paid for.** A label is a *pair*, and the two coordinate facts arrive
separately: `unorderedSuccessor_worldFinset_subset` puts the successor's world among `b`'s worlds,
`unorderedSuccessor_knownTimes_subset` puts its time among `b`'s times. Confinement of `b` then
supplies a formula `y ∈ b` carrying that world and a formula `z ∈ b` carrying that time, each at a
label in `L` — but `y` and `z` are in general *different* formulas, so `⟨y.label.world, z.label.time⟩`
is a quadrant confinement alone does not reach. That cross-product gap is exactly the one register
entry 21 warns about, and `TimeMergeClosed L` is exactly what closes it:
`timeMergeClosed_iff_product` characterizes a time-merge-closed label set as precisely a full
rectangle of worlds against times, which is the cross-product closure a pair-valued label needs. No
further hypothesis is required, and a reader who expects to have to re-derive the worry can stop
here.

`TimeMergeClosed L` is not new currency either: it is already a sibling hypothesis at every terminus
in the chain, where it discharges `UniverseClosedAt`'s clause 2.

`OrdTimesKnown b ord` is inherited from `unorderedSuccessor_knownTimes_subset` and through it from
`applyRule_emitted_time_mem`, where `applyRule_emitted_time_mem_ordTimesKnown_needed` shows it is not
removable. It is the one hypothesis here that the world coordinate does not need — see the section
note on the asymmetry — and it is the reason this composite cannot be stated at
`UniverseClosedAt`'s clause 1, which carries no such hypothesis. -/

before by `unorderedSuccessor_formula_mem` from `hC`/`hT`, and the label coordinate by
`unorderedSuccessor_label_mem_of_propositional` from the two syntactic conditions and
`TimeMergeClosed L`. Nothing here is assumed that cannot be exhibited — contrast the `_of_headroom`
original, whose `hlab` is false at every nonempty `L`, and the C11 sibling
`unorderedSuccessor_confined_signedUniverse_of_freshLabelHeadroom`, whose `FreshLabelHeadroom L b` is
refutable as a universally quantified condition.

/-- **`UniverseClosedAt fc (signedUniverse C L)` with no residual and no frame-class restriction.**

The theorem section D4's boundary block recorded as *not stateable*. Its hypotheses are two stock
conditions (`TableauClosed C`, `TrichStock C`), the label-set closure condition (`TimeMergeClosed L`,
satisfied by every rectangle — `timeMergeClosed_product`), and the two syntactic shape conditions on
the stock. There is **no** `UnorderedSuccessorLabelClosed`, **no** `OrdTimesKnown`, and **no**
frame-class hypothesis.

Assembled exactly as `universeClosedAt_signedUniverse_of_headroom` is: a two-component anonymous
constructor whose clause 2 is `timeMergeClosed_identifyTime_signedUniverse hL`, unchanged and taking
no argument the `_of_headroom` original does not also give it. Only clause 1 differs, and it is the
`ordFree` composite above.

**It is nevertheless vacuous, for a reason that has nothing to do with `hlab`.** `hC` and `hfree`
are jointly unsatisfiable: `TableauClosed.serialFuture` requires `Formula.top.someFuture ∈ C`, and
`Formula.someFuture ⊤` is `⊤ untl ⊤`, which `untlSnceFree` rejects.
`tableauClosed_untlSnceFree_false` below decides this, and it is stated immediately after this
theorem rather than in a note so that no reader takes the removal of `hlab` for a discharge. The
same collision hits `unorderedSuccessor_confined_signedUniverse_of_propositional` and its `ordFree`
sibling above, and section D3's
`buildTableauAt_isSome_at_seed_lengthBudget_signedUniverse_untlSnceFree`, all of which carry both
hypotheses.

What is *not* hit is anything that takes only the syntactic condition:
`applyRule_emitted_time_mem_of_untlSnceFree`,
`unorderedSuccessor_knownTimes_subset_of_untlSnceFree`,
`unorderedSuccessor_label_mem_of_propositional_ordFree`, and section D3's
`mintPaysForTime_of_untlSnceFree` chain take no `TableauClosed` and are non-vacuous. The collision
is between stock *closure* and stock *shape*, and it is located at exactly one field.

What this does **not** do is restate the terminus. The `_at` / `_selfGuarded` / `_fixed` families and
`buildTableauAt_isSome_at_seed_lengthBudget_signedUniverse_*` are untouched, and removing their
`hlab` is separate, downstream work. See the boundary block below. -/

    fun _ _ _ hbU ht₁ => timeMergeClosed_identifyTime_signedUniverse hL hbU ht₁⟩

/-- **`TableauClosed C` and `∀ φ ∈ C, untlSnceFree φ = true` cannot both hold.** Decided, not
argued, and in one field: `TableauClosed.serialFuture` demands `Formula.top.someFuture ∈ C` —
`serialityRule` emits `T(F⊤)` at every label from no trigger at all, so any stock closed under the
engine's outputs contains it — and `Formula.someFuture ⊤` unfolds to `Formula.untl ⊤ ⊤`, which
`untlSnceFree` rejects by its `untl` arm.

**What this decides, and what it does not.** Every theorem in this file carrying *both* hypotheses is
therefore vacuously true, whatever else its signature says. That is four declarations:
`unorderedSuccessor_confined_signedUniverse_of_propositional` and its `ordFree` sibling,
`universeClosedAt_signedUniverse_of_propositional`, and section D3's
`buildTableauAt_isSome_at_seed_lengthBudget_signedUniverse_untlSnceFree` — the last of which register
entry 21 already records as vacuous through `hlab`, and which is now vacuous twice over and for
independent reasons.

Nothing carrying only the syntactic condition is affected, and that is most of the machinery:
section D3's `applyRule_emitted_time_mem_of_untlSnceFree`,
`unorderedSuccessor_knownTimes_subset_of_untlSnceFree`, `mintPaysForTime_of_untlSnceFree` and its
descendants, and this section's `unorderedSuccessor_label_mem_of_propositional_ordFree` all stand
non-vacuously. Removing `OrdTimesKnown` from the time coordinate was real work with a real result;
what it turns out not to buy is a non-vacuous composite at `signedUniverse C L`.

**Where the obstruction actually sits, for whoever picks this up.** Not in the shape condition and
not in the time coordinate, but in `TableauClosed`'s `serialFuture` / `serialPast` fields, which are
forced by `serialityRule` firing unconditionally at every label. A non-vacuous propositional
composite therefore needs either a weakened stock-closure predicate that does not demand the
seriality outputs — and then a re-derivation of `unorderedSuccessor_formula_mem` at it — or a
syntactic condition weaker than `untlSnceFree` that admits `⊤ untl ⊤` while still excluding the four
propagation arms and `.orderTrichotomy`. Neither is attempted here, and neither is refuted. -/

/-! ### The boundary: what Route 1 turned out to be, and where this section now stops

**An earlier version of this block recorded a shape mismatch as settled and Route 1 as
unattempted. Both halves are now false, and the block is rewritten rather than patched so that no
reader inherits the superseded verdict.** What it said was this: `UniverseClosedAt fc U`'s clause 1
is

  `∀ b ord tr, (∀ x ∈ b, x ∈ U) → ∀ nb ∈ unorderedSuccessorBranches …, ∀ x ∈ nb, x ∈ U`

with `ord` **universally quantified and unconstrained**, while every theorem closing the time
coordinate carried `OrdTimesKnown b ord`, inherited through `unorderedSuccessor_knownTimes_subset`
from `applyRule_emitted_time_mem` — where `applyRule_emitted_time_mem_ordTimesKnown_needed` proves
the hypothesis is not removable. Two routes past it were named: re-derive the time sweep on this
fragment's reachable rules (Route 1), or thread `OrdTimesKnown` through the whole closure interface
(Route 2).

**Route 1 was attempted and it works.** `applyRule_emitted_time_mem_of_untlSnceFree` (section D3)
is the time sweep with `OrdTimesKnown b ord` replaced by `∀ x ∈ b, untlSnceFree x.formula = true`.
The replacement is exact, not approximate: `haux` is consumed at exactly five rule arms, and all
five are shape-gated by that condition —

* `.allFuturePos` and `.allPastPos`, whose `applyRule` arms match the raw `Formula.allFuture` /
  `Formula.allPast` shapes, each headed by an `untl` / `snce` node;
* `.someFutureNeg` and `.somePastNeg`, gated by `asSomeFuture?` / `asSomePast?`, which section D3's
  view lemmas already send to `none`;
* `.orderTrichotomy`, whose `fires` guard demands the branch carry
  `SignedFormula.neg d l0` for one of three `Formula.someFuture`-headed disjuncts.

The first four are excluded by the *trigger's* shape; the fifth is excluded by what the *branch*
carries, which is why the restricted sweep takes a branch-level hypothesis. That asymmetry is also
what makes the route work at all: clause 1 hands over `∀ x ∈ b, x ∈ signedUniverse C L`, from which
branch-level freeness follows in one line, and hands over nothing whatever about `ord`.

**One correction to the superseded block's own reasoning, recorded because it was load-bearing.**
That block conjectured Route 1 would need the pick to be constrained — the linearity stage yielding
`.branchingOrdered`, the seriality stage emitting at the trigger's label, and so on. None of that is
needed. The five exclusions are local to `applyRule`'s arms, no rule set is restricted, and `boxFree`
plays no part in the time coordinate at all: it is what closes the **world** coordinate
(`unorderedSuccessor_worldFinset_subset`), and the restricted sweep carries one syntactic hypothesis
rather than two.

**What the section now delivers.** `universeClosedAt_signedUniverse_of_propositional`:
`UniverseClosedAt fc (signedUniverse C L)` from `TableauClosed C`, `TrichStock C`,
`TimeMergeClosed L`, and the two shape conditions — with no `UnorderedSuccessorLabelClosed`, no
`OrdTimesKnown`, and no frame-class restriction. It is the statement this block previously recorded
as not stateable, and it is now stated and proved.

**And it is vacuous — a second obstruction, found only once the first was removed.**
`tableauClosed_untlSnceFree_false` decides that `TableauClosed C` and
`∀ φ ∈ C, untlSnceFree φ = true` cannot both hold: `TableauClosed.serialFuture` demands
`Formula.top.someFuture ∈ C`, and `Formula.someFuture ⊤` is `⊤ untl ⊤`. So the composite above,
`unorderedSuccessor_confined_signedUniverse_of_propositional` and its `ordFree` sibling, and section
D3's `buildTableauAt_isSome_at_seed_lengthBudget_signedUniverse_untlSnceFree` are all vacuously true
— the last one now for two independent reasons, `hlab` and this. This is stated plainly rather than
softened: removing `OrdTimesKnown` was necessary and is done, and it is not sufficient.

**What is not vacuous.** Everything that takes the shape condition without `TableauClosed`:
`applyRule_emitted_time_mem_of_untlSnceFree`,
`unorderedSuccessor_knownTimes_subset_of_untlSnceFree`,
`unorderedSuccessor_label_mem_of_propositional_ordFree`, and section D3's whole
`mintPaysForTime_of_untlSnceFree` chain. The time coordinate is genuinely closed on this fragment;
what is not available is a stock that is simultaneously closed under the engine's outputs and free
of `untl`.

**The boundary that remains, stated exactly.** No theorem in this section removes `hlab` from
`buildTableauAt_isSome_at_seed_lengthBudget_signedUniverse_untlSnceFree` or from any of its eight
siblings, and doing so would in any case exchange one vacuity for another. The live question is no
longer `OrdTimesKnown`; it is whether a stock-closure predicate weaker than `TableauClosed` — one
that does not demand `serialityRule`'s two outputs — supports `unorderedSuccessor_formula_mem`, or
whether a shape condition weaker than `untlSnceFree` still excludes the five arms. Neither is
attempted here and neither is refuted.

**Route 2 remains unattempted and is now unnecessary for this purpose.** An `Ord`-flavoured
`UniverseClosedAt`, and the same for `DifficultyBounded`, cascading through roughly twenty
restatements down to `buildTableauAt`, was the fallback if Route 1 failed. It did not fail. Route 2
is neither started nor recommended. -/
