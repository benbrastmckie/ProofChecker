/-! # C10. The repaired closure residual, and the chain stated at it

`UniverseClosed`'s second conjunct is refuted above at every nonempty `U`
(`universeClosed_identify_retime_false`), so the four theorems that assume it are conditionals no
caller can discharge. This section supplies the repair and restates the chain at it.

**The repair, and why it is exactly this.** Clause 2's defect is a single unconstrained quantifier:
the merge *target* `t₁`. `UniverseClosedAt` restricts it to `b.knownTimes` and changes nothing else
— clause 1 is carried verbatim and the merge *source* `t₂` stays free. Restricting `t₂` as well
would weaken the predicate for no gain, since the proof of
`timeMergeClosed_identifyTime_signedUniverse` below never appeals to it; register entry 12 records
that as a tempting-but-wrong repair.

**The restriction is free at every consuming site**, which is what makes this a repair rather than a
new caller obligation. Both sites that consume clause 2 reach `t₁` through
`expandOnceUnblocked_splitOrdered_shape`, which returns the trigger
`firstIncomparablePair b ord = some (t₁, t₂)` alongside the arms; `firstIncomparablePair_spec`
turns that trigger into `t₁ ∈ b.knownTimes` on the spot. So the hypothesis is discharged locally and
never surfaces on the terminus.

## DIVERGENCE, recorded: the chain is restated additively, not generalized in place

The plan's Phase 3 wrote this as an in-place generalization of the ten signatures carrying
`hUcl : UniverseClosed fc U`, with the original shapes retained afterwards as corollaries. It is
done the other way round here: **every one of those ten theorems is left byte-identical**, and the
chain at the repaired predicate is added alongside under `…_at` names. Two reasons, both of which
the plan's own acceptance criteria prefer:

* Its Testing & Validation asks that "every pre-existing theorem statement still resolves by name
  with the same statement". An in-place hypothesis-type change alters ten landed statements —
  including **the** terminus — and would have satisfied that criterion only by renaming the
  generalized forms anyway, which is what is done here directly.
* The landed terminus's proof terms stay untouched, so nothing about the parent development has to
  be re-verified.

The cost is that the two arithmetic step lemmas are restated rather than shared. They are not
weakened: `budgetPotential_step_unordered_at` and `budgetPotential_step_splitOrdered_at` have the
identical conclusions, and the only difference in either proof is which projection supplies
confinement. A reader who wants the shared form should factor the confinement facts out as
hypotheses (`∀ x ∈ nb, x ∈ U` for the unordered lemma, and the trigger-indexed form for the ordered
one) and derive all four from those two — that refactor would touch the landed proofs and is
deliberately not done here. -/

/-- **The repaired closure residual.** Clause 1 verbatim from `UniverseClosed`; clause 2 with the
merge target `t₁` restricted to a time the branch already knows.

`UniverseClosed` is strictly stronger — `universeClosedAt_of_universeClosed` is the implication, and
the converse fails at every nonempty `U` by `universeClosed_identify_retime_false`, so the two are
genuinely not interchangeable.

**What the repair does and does not fix, stated precisely.** It repairs clause **2**, which as stated
was satisfiable only at `U = ∅` and is now dischargeable at `U = signedUniverse C L` from a closure
condition on the label set (`timeMergeClosed_identifyTime_signedUniverse`). It does **not** touch
clause 1, which is carried verbatim and has an independent defect in its label coordinate:
`universeClosedAt_fresh_world_escapes` refutes this very predicate at a concrete `signedUniverse C L`.
So `UniverseClosedAt` is not satisfiable at an arbitrary `signedUniverse C L` either.
`universeClosedAt_signedUniverse_of_headroom` is what it takes — the two stock conditions, the label
closure condition, and one named residual for clause 1's label coordinate. -/
def UniverseClosedAt (fc : FormalSystem.ProofSystem.FrameClass) (U : Finset SignedFormula) : Prop :=
  (∀ (b : Branch) (ord : TimeOrdering) (tr : EventualityTracker), (∀ x ∈ b, x ∈ U) →
      ∀ nb ∈ unorderedSuccessorBranches (expandOnceUnblocked b ord fc tr).1, ∀ x ∈ nb, x ∈ U) ∧
  (∀ (b : Branch) (t₁ t₂ : TimeIndex), (∀ x ∈ b, x ∈ U) → t₁ ∈ b.knownTimes →
      ∀ x ∈ b.identifyTime t₂ t₁, x ∈ U)

/-- **The direction, stated explicitly.** `UniverseClosedAt` is the **weaker** hypothesis, so every
theorem restated against it is a **strengthening** of its `UniverseClosed`-shaped predecessor — the
same sense in which `ordTimesLeMaxTime_of_ordTimesKnown` records that `OrdTimesKnown` strengthens
the run invariant rather than weakening it.

The converse is **false** whenever `U` is nonempty, by `universeClosed_identify_retime_false`: there
is no `UniverseClosed`-shaped theorem to be recovered from a `UniverseClosedAt`-shaped one, and none
is wanted, since the stronger hypothesis is the unsatisfiable one. -/

/-- **Clause 2, supplied at an ordered split's trigger.** The bridge that makes the restriction
free: at any branch where `timeLinearity` fires, the arm-3 merge target is a known time, so
`UniverseClosedAt`'s restricted clause applies with nothing extra assumed.

This is the single lemma that would have to fail for the repair to have leaked a new hypothesis into
the terminus. It does not fail: `firstIncomparablePair_spec` is exactly what it needs. -/

  h.2 b t₁ t₂ hbU (firstIncomparablePair_spec htrig).1

/-- **Clause 2 at the engine's own orientation.** The oriented merge target is `max t₁ t₂`, and
`firstIncomparablePair_spec_oriented` puts it in `b.knownTimes` exactly as the unoriented spec puts
`t₁` there. Clause 2 is discharged *as it stands*: it already quantifies its source time freely and
restricts only its target, so swapping which member of the pair is which costs one fact the trigger
already supplies and adds no hypothesis. That is register entry 12's finding paying off — had
clause 2 been "repaired" by constraining both times, this bridge would have needed a fact no
trigger supplies. -/

/-! ### The closure condition on the label set, and the repaired clause 2 at `signedUniverse C L`

The repaired clause 2 *is* a caller's obligation about the label set, and this is it. The condition
is small, it is exactly what the clause reduces to, and it is satisfiable — the three things the
`DifficultyBounded` episode showed a residual has to be before it is worth stating.

Why it takes this shape: an identification moves a label's **time** coordinate and leaves its world
coordinate and its formula alone. So confinement of `b.identifyTime t₂ t₁` needs `L` to contain
`⟨z.label.world, t₁⟩` for each `z ∈ b`, and `t₁` is a time some `y ∈ b` already carries. Both
`z.label` and `y.label` are in `L`, so the requirement is precisely closure of `L` under taking one
member's world with another's time. -/

/-- **The closure condition on the label set.** `L` contains every label built from one member's
world and another member's time.

This is exactly the reduction of `UniverseClosedAt`'s clause 2 at `U = signedUniverse C L`, and
`timeMergeClosed_identifyTime_signedUniverse` is the reduction. It is used **once** in that proof, at
the retimed case, which is the check that it is neither stronger nor weaker than needed.

Satisfiable and non-vacuous: `timeMergeClosed_product` exhibits a whole family satisfying it, and
`timeMergeClosed_iff_product` shows the family is *all* of them — a `TimeMergeClosed` label set is
precisely a full rectangle of worlds against times. -/
def TimeMergeClosed (L : Finset Label) : Prop :=
  ∀ l ∈ L, ∀ l' ∈ L, (⟨l.world, l'.time⟩ : Label) ∈ L

/-- **The satisfiability witness.** Every rectangular label set — all of `Ws` against all of `Ts` —
is time-merge closed. Without this the condition could be vacuous, which is the failure mode
`DifficultyBounded` fell into: a residual nobody can satisfy makes its theorem a true conditional
with no reach. -/

/-- **The characterization**: the rectangles are the only time-merge closed label sets. A
`TimeMergeClosed` `L` is the full product of its own world and time projections.

Not a dependency of anything below — it is here because it is what makes the condition legible. A
caller who wants `TimeMergeClosed L` has no choice to make beyond picking the two projections. -/

/-- **The repaired clause 2, discharged at the concrete universe.** Exactly
`UniverseClosedAt`'s second conjunct at `U = signedUniverse C L`, under `TimeMergeClosed L`.

Each member of `b.identifyTime t₂ t₁` is either an untouched member of `b` — confined by hypothesis
— or a retimed one. The formula coordinate is untouched either way, so it stays in `C` by
`formula_label_of_mem_signedUniverse`; the retimed label is `⟨z.label.world, t₁⟩`, and
`TimeMergeClosed` supplies it once `t₁` is exhibited as `y.label.time` for some `y ∈ b`, which is
what `t₁ ∈ b.knownTimes` gives via `exists_mem_of_mem_knownTimes`.

**`t₂` is not constrained**, and the proof shows why it need not be: the source time is only ever
tested against, never used to build a label. Constraining it too would weaken the predicate for
nothing — register entry 12. -/

/-! ### Clause 1's label dimension is refuted at a fixed finite `signedUniverse C L`

Clause 2 was the residual's *fatal* defect and `UniverseClosedAt` repairs it. Clause 1 has a second,
**independent** defect, and this subsection settles it rather than assuming either way. The verdict is
that clause 1 is refutable at a fixed finite `signedUniverse C L` — so `UniverseClosedAt` is not
satisfiable at an arbitrary `signedUniverse C L` either, and the repair of clause 2 does not rescue
it. Both predicates carry clause 1 verbatim, so one witness refutes both.

**The cause: fresh worlds.** `applyRule_boxNeg_emitted_world` and
`applyRule_diamondPos_emitted_world` prove those two rules emit **only** at `Branch.nextWorld`, and
`nextWorld_not_mem_worldFinset` says that world is fresh — not a world of `b` at all. So a branch
confined to `signedUniverse C L` whose worlds exhaust `L`'s worlds has a `boxNeg` successor whose
label is outside `L` by construction. `freshWorldBranch` below is the minimal such configuration:
one formula, `F(□p)` at `⟨0, 0⟩`, and `L = {⟨0, 0⟩}`.

**Why blocking does not save it.** Clause 1 quantifies over **every** tracker `tr` and every ordering
`ord`, and the witness below is proved at every one of them. `blocking_fires_of_card_lt` would need
an `allEventualitiesFulfilledOrDuplicated` guard that clause 1's caller never gets to supply.

**Why no closure condition on `L` repairs it, unlike clause 2.** `freshWorldHeadroom_not_universal`
is the general statement: for **no** nonempty finite `L` whatsoever does every `L`-confined branch
have its next world already in `L`. Each enlargement of `L` raises the reachable `maxWorld` by at
least as much as it adds, so the gap re-opens. The repair therefore cannot live in `L` — it has to be
a **branch-side headroom** hypothesis, which is what `FreshWorldHeadroom` below states and what
register entry 11 records. -/

`boxNeg` and `diamondPos` emit only at `Branch.nextWorld` (`applyRule_boxNeg_emitted_world`,
`applyRule_diamondPos_emitted_world`), and this is exactly the label set membership their emissions
require. It is stated about the **branch**, not about `L`, and

For every nonempty finite `L` there is an `L`-confined branch whose `Branch.nextWorld` is outside
`L` — take a branch sitting at `L`'s largest world, whose next world is one higher. Enlarging `L` to
cover it raises the largest world too, so the gap re-opens at every enlargement. Contrast clause 2,
where `TimeMergeClosed` closes the analogous gap outright because identification moves a label
*within* the existing coordinates rather than past them.

This is why `FreshWorldHeadroom` is a hypothesis about the **branch**, not about `L`: as a condition
on `L` alone, quantified over the confined branches it would have to serve, it is unsatisfiable. -/

/-! ### Clause 1's formula dimension, unconditionally, at both unordered shapes

Clause 1 has two independent halves, and separating them is what makes the situation legible: the
**formula** coordinate of every successor stays inside `C` outright, with no side condition beyond
what `Fuel.lean` already asks; the **label** coordinate is the one that escapes
(`universeClosed_fresh_world_escapes`). Proving the formula half here, in full, is what shows the
refutation above is not a defect of the whole clause — it is confined to one coordinate.

`.extended` is `expandOnceUnblocked_extended_mem`, already landed in `Fuel.lean`. `.split` had no
analogue, and `expandOnceUnblocked_split_mem` is it. The `.splitOrdered` and `.saturated` shapes are
vacuous here because `unorderedSuccessorBranches` is `[]` on both. -/

The missing analogue of `expandOnceUnblocked_extended_mem`, and it needs **no new per-rule case
analysis**. `RuleResult.emitted` is defined on all five result shapes and sends `.branching bss` to
`bss.flatten`, so `applyRule_subformula_closed` — which is stated over `emitted` — already covers the
branching arms. What was missing is only the pick-stage destructuring, which is
`expandOnceUnblocked_extended_mem`'s own three-stage `rcases` with `pick_result_mem` (which handles
only `.linear`/`.persistent`) replaced by `applyRule_subformula_closed` directly.

/-! ### Clause 1's label dimension: the honest maximum, and where the obstruction actually sits

Phase order in this section: the formula dimension is **proved** above; the label dimension is
**refuted** as a property of a fixed finite `L` (`universeClosed_fresh_world_escapes`) and cannot be
repaired by any condition on `L` (`freshWorldHeadroom_not_universal`). What remains is to say exactly
how much of the label dimension is available and what the residue costs. That is done here, in the
style `StepLengthGrowth`'s docstring uses for its own obligation map: per rule shape, which lemma
supplies it, and which piece is absent. Read this together with section C11, which spends the time
analogue once it lands and settles that the obstruction is the world coordinate's refutation rather
than any absent lemma.

**The world coordinate is fully accounted for.** `applyRule_emitted_world_dichotomy` below is the
complete statement: every emitted formula sits either at a world the branch already has or at
`Branch.nextWorld`, with no third possibility, assembled from the landed 34 × 2 split
(`applyRule_emitted_world_mem`) and the two minting lemmas. So the world half of the label dimension
needs nothing beyond `FreshWorldHeadroom`.

**The time coordinate now has its analogue.** An earlier version of this note said there was no
`applyRule_emitted_time_mem` and that the label dimension was blocked on its absence. That is no
longer the state of the file: section D1 lands it, together with `freshTimeRules` (the census the
note said no statement supplied), `applyRule_emitted_time_dichotomy`, and the engine-level
`unorderedSuccessor_time_dichotomy`. The census is nine rules wide and is **incomparable** with
`ruleMintsFreshLabel` in both directions — `freshTimeRules_incomparable_freshLabelRules` decides
that, which is the precise content the old note gestured at when it observed that `densityRule` and
the `untlNeg` / `snceNeg` ACTIVE arms mint times while sitting outside the witness-guarded list.

One asymmetry with the world coordinate is real and is not a gap in the proof:
`applyRule_emitted_time_mem` carries `OrdTimesKnown b ord` where its world twin carries nothing,
because four rules propagate to `TimeOrdering.futureOf` / `pastOf` and nothing in `applyRule` ties
an ordering time to the branch. `applyRule_emitted_time_mem_ordTimesKnown_needed` decides that the
hypothesis is not removable, and `expandOnceUnblocked_ordTimesKnown` supplies it at every consuming
site, so nothing new reaches the terminus.

`UnorderedSuccessorLabelClosed` below is nevertheless **still a named residual**, for the reason
recorded on its own docstring: the world half of the label dimension is refuted at a fixed finite
`L` (`universeClosed_fresh_world_escapes`) and no condition on `L` repairs it
(`freshWorldHeadroom_not_universal`). The time accounting that was missing has landed; the world-side
obstruction is what remains, and it was never the missing lemma.

**What is delivered, then**: clause 1 at `signedUniverse C L` reduced to the label dimension **alone**
(`unorderedSuccessor_confined_signedUniverse_of_headroom`), with the formula dimension discharged
outright. -/

/-- **The world dichotomy, complete.** Every formula a rule emits sits either at a world the branch
already carries or at `Branch.nextWorld` — there is no third case.

Assembled from the three landed lemmas and nothing else: `applyRule_emitted_world_mem` covers the 34
rules that introduce no world, and `applyRule_boxNeg_emitted_world` /
`applyRule_diamondPos_emitted_world` cover the two that do, each pinning the emission to
`Branch.nextWorld` exactly. This is the world-coordinate half of clause 1's label dimension, and it
is the half that is available. -/

/-- **Clause 1's label dimension, as a named residual.**

Exactly the label half of `UniverseClosedAt`'s first conjunct, separated out because the formula half
is proved (`unorderedSuccessor_formula_mem`) and this half is not. It is a hypothesis, it is named,
and nothing in this file assumes it.

**The obligation map.** What discharging this needs, per coordinate:

*The world coordinate — available.* `applyRule_emitted_world_dichotomy` is the complete accounting:
every emission is at a world of `b` or at `Branch.nextWorld`. The first case is covered by
`L`-confinement of `b`; the second is exactly what `FreshWorldHeadroom L b` supplies. Note the
headroom must be branch-side: `freshWorldHeadroom_not_universal` proves that no nonempty finite `L`
supplies it for all `L`-confined branches, so this cannot be turned into a closure condition on `L`
the way `TimeMergeClosed` was for clause 2.

*The time coordinate — available, since section D1.* An earlier version of this paragraph said there
was **no** `applyRule_emitted_time_mem`, that the rule *list* was unsettled, and that supplying the
analogue was a 36-arm accounting owned elsewhere. That is no longer the state of the file:
`applyRule_emitted_time_mem`, `applyRule_emitted_time_dichotomy` and the engine-level
`unorderedSuccessor_time_dichotomy` have landed, and `freshTimeRules` is the census the old paragraph
said no statement supplied. `freshTimeRules_incomparable_freshLabelRules` decides that the census is
incomparable with `ruleMintsFreshLabel` in **both** directions, which is the precise content the old
paragraph gestured at when it observed that `densityRule` and the `untlNeg` / `snceNeg` active arms
mint times while sitting outside the witness-guarded list. One hypothesis comes with the analogue,
`OrdTimesKnown b ord`, and `applyRule_emitted_time_mem_ordTimesKnown_needed` decides that it is not
removable; `ordTimesKnown_empty` and `expandOnceUnblocked_ordTimesKnown` supply it at every consuming
site, so it is not new currency.

*Both coordinates together are still not this residual, and that is now proved rather than pending.*
Section C11 spends the completed accounting: `unorderedSuccessor_label_mem_of_headroom` proves the
label dimension outright from the branch-side rectangle `FreshLabelHeadroom`, and
`unorderedSuccessorLabelClosedOrd_of_headroom` reduces the residual to that rectangle holding at every
`L`-confined branch. The reduction is complete and the residual nevertheless survives, because
`freshLabelHeadroom_not_universal` refutes the rectangle at every nonempty finite `L`. The obstruction
was always the *world* coordinate's refutation (`universeClosed_fresh_world_escapes`,
`freshWorldHeadroom_not_universal`), never the missing time lemma. Two structural facts are worth
carrying away: a label is a **pair**, so per-coordinate dichotomies leave four quadrants rather than
two; and confinement of `b` covers none of the four, because it constrains the pairs `b` carries and
not their cross product.

*The `.splitOrdered` shape does not arise*, because `unorderedSuccessorBranches` is `[]` on it —
that shape's confinement is clause 2's business and is discharged by
`timeMergeClosed_identifyTime_signedUniverse`. -/

The deliverable of the label-dimension phase. `TableauClosed C` and `TrichStock C` discharge the
formula coordinate outright via `unorderedSuccessor_formula_mem`; what is left is exactly
`UnorderedSuccessorLabelClosed`, whose obligation map is on its own docstring. So the residue is
one coordinate, not two, and it is explicit rather than absorbed.

This is clause 1 of `UniverseClosedAt fc (signedUniverse C L)` in the form
`universeClosedAt_signedUniverse_of_headroom` consumes. -/

/-- **The label residual is refuted at this `L`** — the single-witness form, retained as the file's
original record of the finding. `universeClosed_fresh_world_escapes`'s configuration, read at the
residual's own shape: the one-formula branch `[F(□p)@⟨0,0⟩]` is confined to
`freshWorldLabels = {⟨0,0⟩}`, its step fires `.boxNeg` at every frame class and every tracker, and
the emitted `F(p)` sits at world `1`.

**The bracket this docstring used to state is false, and section C11 proves it false.** An earlier
version said the residual "holds at every `L` for which the engine never fires", and bracketed it as
*refutable at some `signedUniverse C L`, satisfiable at others*, so that the composite above would be
genuinely conditional without being vacuous. Neither half survives:
`unorderedSuccessorLabelClosed_nonempty_false` refutes the residual at **every** nonempty finite `L`,
at every frame class, and `unorderedSuccessorLabelClosed_empty` proves it at `∅`. Its satisfiability
set is therefore exactly `{∅}` — so the "engine never fires" class is not a substantive class of
label sets, it is the one-element class `{∅}`. And `signedUniverse C ∅ = ∅`, so at the only `L` where
the hypothesis is available the universe is empty and every consumer of it is a true conditional with
no reach. Register entries 11 and 21 carry the consequence for the nine theorems that take this
predicate as a hypothesis.

The statement and proof below are unchanged and are **not** withdrawn: the single witness is what the
sections between here and C11 cite, and `UnorderedSuccessorLabelClosedOrd` — needed to state the
generalized form — is not defined until C11, so the general form could not be stated here. -/

/-! ### The composite at the concrete universe, and the terminus that consumes it

What the section has established, assembled. `UniverseClosedAt fc (signedUniverse C L)` follows from
three conditions plus one named residual, and each of the four is where it belongs:

| Conjunct | Discharged by | Cost |
|----------|---------------|------|
| clause 1, formula coordinate | `unorderedSuccessor_formula_mem` | `TableauClosed C`, `TrichStock C` — both already `Fuel.lean`'s currency |
| clause 1, label coordinate | -- | `UnorderedSuccessorLabelClosed fc L`, a **named residual** with its obligation map on its own docstring |
| clause 2 | `timeMergeClosed_identifyTime_signedUniverse` | `TimeMergeClosed L` — satisfiable, `timeMergeClosed_product` |

So of the residual's two conjuncts, **clause 2 is paid outright** and clause 1 is reduced from two
coordinates to one. That is the accounting the terminus corollary below inherits, and its docstring
states it rather than leaving a reader to infer that the terminus has become unconditional. -/

/-- **The composite.** `UniverseClosedAt fc (signedUniverse C L)` from the two stock conditions, the
label-set closure condition, and the one named residual.

Read against the residual this task started from: `UniverseClosed fc (signedUniverse C L)` is
**false** whenever the universe is nonempty (`universeClosed_nonempty_false`), so there is no
composite of that shape to be had at all. This is the repaired predicate, and its clause 2 is
genuinely discharged — `TimeMergeClosed L` is a condition on the label set that a caller picks
(every rectangle satisfies it, `timeMergeClosed_product`), not a residual.

What is **not** discharged is clause 1's label coordinate. It is carried as
`UnorderedSuccessorLabelClosed fc L` and it is refutable at some `L`
(`unorderedSuccessorLabelClosed_not_universal`). An earlier version of this paragraph added that the
one lemma which would let it be reduced further — a time-coordinate analogue of
`applyRule_emitted_world_mem` — did not exist in the development. It exists now
(`applyRule_emitted_time_dichotomy`, section D1), and section C11 spends it: the reduction to the
branch-side rectangle `FreshLabelHeadroom` is complete, and the residual survives it anyway because
`freshLabelHeadroom_not_universal` refutes that rectangle at every nonempty finite `L`. So this
hypothesis is not waiting on a lemma. Its obligation map is on
`UnorderedSuccessorLabelClosed`'s docstring; register entry 21 is the verdict. -/

/-- **The terminus with the closure residual paid at `signedUniverse C L`**, at the branch-length
budget — the sibling that is live, since `DifficultyBounded` is refutable at every `D`
(`difficultyBounded_multiplicity_false`).

**Precisely which residuals remain, so that nothing here is over-read.** Five hypotheses, and the
closure residual is not among them:

* `StepLengthBounded fc (signedUniverse C L) L'` — satisfiable; `difficultyBoundedAt_ceiling_at`
  reduces it further to the rule-local `StepLengthGrowth`.
* `MintPaysForTime` — the development's one genuinely open mathematical obligation, and open only
  on the **temporal** fragment. Unchanged as a declaration, and **refuted as stated at a universe of
  temporal formulas** (`mintPaysForTime_untlNeg_false`, section D2) with both obvious repairs closed
  off and the residual obstruction located. Two successive repairs are landed in section D2 —
  `MintPaysForTimeStable`, itself refuted at nonempty `U` by
  `mintPaysForTimeStable_signedUniverse_false`, and `MintPaysForTimeFixed`, which is not — each with
  its direction lemma and its own restated terminus chain. Section D3 then **discharges the
  hypothesis outright** at every `untl`/`snce`-free universe
  (`mintPaysForTimeFixed_signedUniverse_untlSnceFree`), so on that fragment this bullet names one
  residual fewer and the terminus is
  `buildTableauAt_isSome_at_seed_lengthBudget_signedUniverse_untlSnceFree`. See its own docstring.
* `PostBlockingSettles` — unchanged.
* `β ≥ 3` — the measured split arity.
* `UnorderedSuccessorLabelClosed fc L` — **the residue of this task**: clause 1's label coordinate,
  and only that coordinate. Its obligation map is on its own docstring. It is not waiting on a
  lemma: section C11 reduces it, with both coordinates fully accounted for, to the branch-side
  rectangle `FreshLabelHeadroom`, and `freshLabelHeadroom_not_universal` refutes that rectangle at
  every nonempty finite `L`. Register entry 21 records why the reduction is complete without being a
  discharge.

What is **gone** relative to `buildTableauAt_isSome_of_lengthBudget`: the whole of clause 2, and
clause 1's formula coordinate. Clause 2's payment is the substantive one — as stated it was
unsatisfiable at every nonempty universe, and it is now a rectangle condition on the label set. -/
