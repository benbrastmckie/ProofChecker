# T3 — Justified Fuel

T1 (`SubformulaProperty.lean`) fixes the formula stock; T2 (`TimeTypeBound.lean`) bounds the
number of distinguishable times against it. T3 turns those two into a fuel figure at which
`buildTableau` cannot exhaust, so downstream phases only ever see genuinely saturated branches
rather than fuel-starved ones.

## The progress measure, and why it is set growth rather than length growth

`expandOnceUnblocked_adds_new` (landed in Phase 2.5) says an extending step is non-destructive
and adds at least one formula the branch did not carry: `b ⊆ nb ∧ ∃ g ∈ nb, g ∉ b`. Its weaker
sibling `expandOnceUnblocked_length_lt` says the *list* gets longer, and that is deliberately not
what this file consumes. The engine builds `nb = fs ++ b`, and `fs` may repeat formulas already
present, so `List.length` grows without ever approaching a ceiling. What has a ceiling is the
branch **as a set**: `Branch.toFinset` is strictly monotone along an extending step, so a run is
no longer than the finite universe the branch lives in.

`expandOnceUnblocked_card_lt` below is that observation, and it is the step T3's induction turns
into a bound. The universe it runs against has two dimensions:

* **formulas** — bounded by T1: every branch formula stays in a `TableauClosed` stock `C`;
* **labels** — *not* bounded by T1, because witness rules mint fresh times. This is exactly what
  blocking is for, and it is why T2 is a prerequisite rather than a convenience:
  `blocking_fires_of_card_lt` says a chain of more than `2 ^ (2 * |C|)` times cannot be extended,
  so the label dimension is bounded by the same T2 figure.

## Status

Landed: the progress measure, the fuel figure, the branch invariant (`BranchStock`) and its
one-step preservation (`expandOnceUnblocked_extended_stock` — T1 iterated), the signed-formula
universe and its cardinality, and the step bound `chain_le_stock`: **an unbranched run out of a
branch the stock confines takes at most `2 * |C| * |L|` steps.** The formula dimension is fully
discharged there; the label dimension enters as a hypothesis. `chain_le_soundFuel'` puts that
bound at the T2 label figure and lands on `soundFuel'` itself, so the fuel figure this file
defines is earned rather than merely stated — in the unbranched dimension.

**Also landed (the label dimension and the corrected 4.3c).** `chain_le_own_labels` discharges
`chain_le_stock`'s label hypothesis by taking `L` to be the run's own label set, which relocates
the whole obligation to a cardinality; `Branch.card_labelFinset_le` then splits that cardinality
into the two dimensions a `Label` has. `TimeChain` is the run-level chain invariant,
`timeFinset_card_le_of_not_blocked` is T2 contraposed into the direction the fuel argument
consumes, and `timeChain_of_linearity_saturated` establishes the invariant from `timeLinearity`'s
silence — the rule fires exactly while an incomparable pair remains, so its exhaustion *is* the
chain condition. On the 4.3c side, `expandBranchWithFuel_isSome_of_noSplit` proves totality with
the branch budget quantified, ruling out all three sources of `none`.

**Also landed (the general fuel figure, §4.3e).** `soundFuel'` is the **single-world**
(label-count) figure and is frozen as such; `worldFuel' φ s = (s + soundFuel' φ) * soundFuel' φ`
is the general one, and `worldFuel'_eq` shows it is `chain_le_worlds_bounded`'s right-hand side
*exactly*, by associativity and commutativity alone. `chain_le_worldFuel'` restates the chain
bound at that name and `expandBranchWithFuel_isSome_at_worldFuel'` instantiates totality there.
The two figures are a *squaring* apart, not a constant, which is why they are two names.
Three obligations survive and are named in the statements rather than hidden inside the figure:
`WorldWitness` (an invariant, not a theorem), `NoSplit` (the branching arms), and `maxBranches`
(quantified — `buildTableau_isSome` at the engine default is false at any fuel).

**Also landed (the closure duality).** `orderDual_holds` proves `OrderDual` for *every*
`TimeOrdering`, so `timeChain_of_linearity_saturated` and `chain_le_worlds_of_linearity_saturated`
no longer carry it as a hypothesis. The route is `open private` on
`reachableForward`/`reachableBackward` — pure consumption, no engine edit — plus a path
characterisation of the shared breadth-first shape (`bfsClosure`), whose completeness half needs
the `BfsInv` visited-set invariant and a joint induction.

Outstanding, and deliberately not claimed anywhere below:

1. **The branching arms.** Everything here covers `.extended` steps and the `NoSplit` invariant.
   `expandBranchWithFuel`'s `.split` / `.splitOrdered` arms fold over sub-branches and can report
   `none` through `resolveOpenArm` (`Saturation.lean:661-664, :686-689`), which is a distinct
   obligation from the step bound and from the budget guard.
2. **`buildTableau_isSome` is false as an unconditional statement**, and this is a defect of the
   *statement*, not of the engine. `buildTableau` calls `expandBranchWithFuel` at the default
   `maxBranches := 50000` and returns `none` the moment that counter is hit, no matter how much
   fuel it was given; and its own last arm returns `none` when the branch is still unsaturated
   after the post-blocking pass. The corrected statement, proved below, quantifies over the branch
   budget instead. A `buildTableau`-level corollary needs a caller willing to fix `maxBranches`,
   which the current signature's default does not permit without an engine edit.

**T3's step.** An extending expansion strictly grows the branch as a set.

This is `expandOnceUnblocked_adds_new` in the form an induction on a finite universe can consume:
a strictly increasing `Finset` cardinality bounded above by `|U|` admits at most `|U|` steps,
whereas the list-length form admits arbitrarily many.

/--
The step count out of `b` inside a universe `U` is bounded by `|U| - |b|`.

Stated as the single inequality the induction needs: an extending step both grows the branch and
keeps it inside `U`, so its cardinality is squeezed.

/-! ## The fuel figure -/

/--
The uncapped fuel figure, tied to the T2 bound.

`soundFuel` (`Saturation.lean`) is the *runtime* default and is deliberately capped at `100000`,
because blocking fires far earlier in practice and an uncapped exponential would make `#eval`
rows unusable. That cap is exactly what stops it from being a justified bound: a quadratic
constant cannot cover an exponential step count. `soundFuel'` removes the cap and multiplies the
two dimensions the module docstring names — at most `2 * n` signed formulas per time, and at most
`2 ^ (2 * n)` distinguishable times, with `n = |subformulaClosure φ|`.

The figure is *stated* here; the theorem that expansion cannot exhaust it
(`buildTableau_isSome`) is the remaining T3 obligation and is not claimed by this definition.

**This is the single-world (label-count) figure, and that is not a defect of the proof but the
content of the name.** `chain_le_soundFuel'` earns it exactly — with no slack — under a hypothesis
`hL` on the *label* count, and a label is a world *and* a time, so `hL` is reachable from T2 only
while the run stays in one world. For the general case, where `boxNeg`/`diamondPos` have minted
worlds, the figure is `worldFuel'` (this file, §4.3e), which is `soundFuel' φ * (|S| + soundFuel' φ)`
— to a `+1` at the engine's singleton seed, the *square* of this one. `soundFuel'` is kept because
it remains the true and quadratically-exponentially better bound whenever the world count is one,
which for a modal-operator-free `φ` it always is.

**Measured headroom — an empirical witness, not a second bound.** Nothing in this paragraph
weakens, strengthens, or reinterprets the figure above; it records what one concrete formula
actually costs, so a reader can see the order of magnitude the bound leaves unused. For
`φ = (G p) → □(G p)` (`|subformulaClosure φ| = 8`), `buildTableau φ n .Base` was evaluated at
every `n ∈ [0, 40]` and at `45, 50, 60, 80, 100, 200, 400, 1000`: it is `none` for every
`n ≤ 24` and `hasOpen`, with a stationary 40-formula certified open branch, for every `n ≥ 25`.
The sub-ceiling `none` is genuine exhaustion inside `expandBranchWithFuel` — it survives raising
`maxBranches` from its `50000` default to `10^9`, so it is the fuel arm and not the branch-budget
arm — which makes **25 a true measured fuel ceiling for this φ**, bracketed from both sides.
Against it:

| figure | value at this `φ` | ratio to the measured 25 |
|---|---|---|
| measured ceiling | 25 | 1× |
| `soundFuel φ` (`Saturation.lean`, capped runtime default) | 2 048 | ~82× |
| `soundFuel' φ` (this definition) | 1 048 576 | ~4.2×10⁴ |
| `worldFuel' φ 1` (§4.3e) | 1 099 512 676 352 | ~4.4×10¹⁰ |

The 25 is *measured*; the other three are *computed from their definitions* at this `φ`. They are
adjacent facts, not commensurable ones: a measurement on one formula neither confirms nor
threatens a bound quantified over all of them. What it does show is that the T3 obligation
`buildTableau_isSome` is not gated on the figure being tight — for this `φ` the engine finishes
four orders of magnitude below it.

def soundFuel' (φ : Formula) : Nat :=
  let n := (FormalSystem.Syntax.subformulaClosure φ).card

/--
The uncapped figure dominates the capped runtime default, so keeping `soundFuel` as the `#eval`
default (plan constraint 11) never runs the engine *past* the justified bound — it only ever
stops earlier.

  simpa [soundFuel, soundFuel', ← hn] using le_trans (min_le_left _ 100000) hmul

/-! ## The branch invariant

T1 is a statement about **one** rule firing at **one** formula. The fuel loop needs it to survive
iteration, and that is not automatic: `applyRule_subformula_closed` takes `TrichClosed C b` as a
hypothesis about the branch it fires on, so an induction along the loop has to re-establish that
hypothesis at every step. `BranchStock` below is the invariant that does it.
-/

/--
`orderTrichotomy`'s obligation, discharged once at the level of the stock.

`TrichClosed C b` (`SubformulaProperty.lean`) is branch-relative on purpose: as a condition on `C`
alone it re-triggers on its own second disjunct (`F(x ∧ y)` obliges `F(x ∧ F y)`, which is again of
the form `F(x ∧ y′)`), so no finite `C` satisfies it non-vacuously. That is exactly why it is not a
`TableauClosed` field.

`TrichStock` is that rejected condition, stated here **as a hypothesis rather than as a field**,
and the distinction is what keeps it honest. Nothing in this file claims it holds of every stock —
it demonstrably does not. What it does is isolate the residual obligation into a single decidable
side condition on `C`, satisfied outright whenever `C` contains no formula of the shape
`F(A ∧ B)`, which is the case for every stock produced by `closureIter` from a `φ` that does not
itself mention one. See the note on `expandOnceUnblocked_extended_stock` for what a general
argument would have to supply instead.

/-! ## Reading the pick

`expandOnceUnblocked` picks a rule through one of three stages and then appends that rule's
result to the branch. T1 speaks about `applyRule`, so the pick has to be turned back into an
`applyRule` equation before T1 applies. Each stage gets one extraction lemma; they are separate
because the three stages have different guard structure (only the ordinary stage has the
`isApplicable` / fresh-label / `branch.contains` guards).

**T1, iterated.** An extending step keeps every branch formula inside the stock.

The three-stage case split mirrors `expandOnceUnblocked_pick_ne_nil` exactly, and for the same
reason: a hypothesis about the two-stage `match` as a whole is not something the
`findApplicableRule`-level lemmas can consume, so the stages have to be destructured first.
`rw` rather than `simp` on the stage equations is again load-bearing — `simp` normalises
`List.contains` to `decide (· ∈ ·)`, after which the seriality stage's `find?` equation no longer
matches the form `rcases` produced.

The invariant survives a step.

The `trich` field is re-established from `TrichStock` rather than transported from the previous
branch, and that is the honest reading of the 4.2a decision's deferred cost: `TrichClosed` is
*anti*-monotone in the branch (a longer branch has more chances to satisfy its antecedent), so it
cannot simply be carried forward. `orderTrichotomy` itself is harmless — it emits only positive
disjuncts, so it never adds a branch-side *negated* disjunct — but the other rules are not
constrained that way: `negPos` fired on a branch formula `¬F(A ∧ B)` puts a negated `F(A ∧ B)` on
the branch, and nothing in `TableauClosed` then supplies the other two disjuncts of that triple.
`TrichStock` is what supplies them, and it is a hypothesis for exactly that reason.

A general argument that dispensed with `TrichStock` would have to bound the *negatively signed*
formulas of a run more tightly than `C` does — showing that a negated `F(A ∧ B)` reaches the
branch only for the finitely many `A ∧ B` already in the seed's trichotomy completion. That is
the remaining shape of the obligation, and it is recorded in the plan rather than assumed here.

**T3's step bound, in the two dimensions the module docstring names.**

An unbranched run out of a branch the stock `C` confines takes at most `2 * |C| * |L|` steps,
where `L` is any label set the run's last branch stays inside. The formula dimension costs the
caller nothing — `BranchStock` is re-established at every step by `branchStock_chain`, which is
T1 iterated. The label dimension is the caller's `hl`, and supplying it in general is what
`blocking_fires_of_card_lt` does; composing the two is the remaining T3 obligation recorded in
the module docstring.

/-! ## The label dimension, part 1: the hypothesis `hl` costs nothing

`chain_le_stock` takes `hl : ∀ x ∈ run n, x.label ∈ L` and `L` is universally quantified, so the
caller is free to take `L` to be the run's *own* label set, at which point `hl` is a triviality.
That is not a dodge — it relocates the whole label obligation to where it actually lives, namely
in the **cardinality** of that set. The section below performs that relocation and then splits
the cardinality into the two independent dimensions a label has: worlds and times.

Doing this first matters, because the two dimensions have completely different arguments. The
world dimension is bounded by the S5 rules' fresh-world discipline; the time dimension is what
blocking (T2) bounds. Keeping them fused inside an opaque `L` hid the fact that only one of the
two is what `blocking_fires_of_card_lt` is about.

/-! ## The label dimension, part 2: the time factor and the chain invariant

`chain_le_worlds_times` leaves two cardinalities. This section discharges the **time** one, which
is the factor T2 was built to bound, and does so in the direction the fuel argument needs: not
"a long chain makes blocking fire" but its contrapositive, "a branch on which nothing is blocked
has few times".

`blocking_fires_of_card_lt` needs its times *comparable* — pigeonhole alone produces two times of
equal type, and two incomparable times of equal type block nothing. `TimeChain` below is that
comparability, stated over exactly the set the bound is about, and it is the run-level invariant
the module docstring's residual 1 names.
-/

/--
**The run-level chain invariant.** Any two distinct times the branch mentions are comparable in
the transitive ancestor order.

This is precisely `blocking_fires_of_card_lt`'s `hchain` at `ts := b.timeFinset`, stated as a
predicate so that it can be established once (from linearity saturation, below) and consumed
wherever the time bound is needed.
-/
def TimeChain (b : Branch) (ord : TimeOrdering) : Prop :=
  ∀ t₁ ∈ b.knownTimes, ∀ t₂ ∈ b.knownTimes, t₁ ≠ t₂ →
    t₁ ∈ ancestorTimes ord t₂ ∨ t₂ ∈ ancestorTimes ord t₁

/--
**T2, contraposed — the time factor.** On a branch confined to `C` whose times form a chain and
on which `findBlockedTime` reports nothing, there are at most `2 ^ (2 * |C|)` times.

This is the direction the fuel argument consumes. `blocking_fires_of_card_lt` says a long chain
*forces* blocking; a run that is still taking unblocked steps has therefore not yet accumulated
one, and the count is bounded.

/-! ## The label dimension, part 3: where the chain comes from

`TimeChain` is not an assumption about the world; it is what `timeLinearity` produces. That rule's
trigger is `firstIncomparablePair`, which scans `Branch.knownTimes` for a pair neither of whose
members is in the other's transitive future or past, and the rule is *self-suppressing*: it fires
until no such pair remains. So a branch on which the linearity stage reports nothing has all its
times pairwise comparable — which is `TimeChain` modulo the direction the comparability is
recorded in.
-/

/--
**Linearity saturation gives comparability.** If `timeLinearity` has no applicable instance, then
any two distinct branch times are related by the transitive ordering in one direction or the other.

This is the extraction step; turning the `futureOf` disjunct into the `ancestorTimes` form
`blocking_fires_of_card_lt` wants is `TimeChain`'s remaining obligation, isolated as
`OrderDual` below.

/-! ### The breadth-first closures, and their path characterisation

`futureOf` and `pastOf` are the same breadth-first search run against `directFutureOf` and
`directPastOf`. This section factors that shared shape out as `bfsClosure`, characterises it by
paths in both directions, and uses the characterisation to prove the two closures dual.

The soundness half is routine. The awkward half is **completeness**, because the visited set makes
the naive statement false: a BFS whose `visited` was seeded with a node it never expanded can miss
everything downstream of that node. What rules this out is `BfsInv` — every visited node is either
still on the frontier or has already had all its successors recorded — which holds at the `[]`
seed and is preserved by a layer step. Completeness is then a *joint* induction over the frontier
and visited statements, because a path leaving a visited node either steps inside the
already-expanded region (visited case, one edge shorter) or restarts from the frontier (frontier
case, same length), and neither statement is provable without the other.

/-! ### Monotonicity of the closures under constraint extension

The `addFuture` arms of `timeLinearity` extend the constraint list without touching the branch.
What the progress measure needs from that is: adding a constraint can only *grow* each closure,
and the constraint just added is actually seen by the closure. Both are consumers of the BFS
calculus above — nothing new is built.

The fuel bound is not an obstacle, and for the same reason `orderDual_holds` already relies on:
`bfsClosure_sound` bounds the extracted path's length by the very fuel `bfsClosure_complete` is
allowed to spend, so a path transported along a *larger* edge set is re-found at the *same* fuel
`100`. Growing the edge set never lengthens the witnessing path. -/

**The one residual of the label dimension: the two closures are duals.**

`firstIncomparablePair` records comparability as "`t₂` is in `t₁`'s `futureOf`", while
`isTemporallyBlocked` — and hence `blocking_fires_of_card_lt` — reads it as "`t₁` is in `t₂`'s
`ancestorTimes`", which is `pastOf`. The two are the forward and backward transitive closures of
the *same* constraint list.

The condition is kept as a named `def` rather than inlined because it is the precise interface
between the two readings, and because the duality probes below evaluate it directly. It is
**no longer a hypothesis**: `orderDual_holds` discharges it for every `TimeOrdering`.
-/
def OrderDual (ord : TimeOrdering) : Prop :=

/--
**The duality holds, for every ordering.** Forward BFS membership yields a constraint path of
between one and `100` edges (`bfsClosure_sound`); reversing it edge-by-edge against
`mem_directFutureOf_iff` gives a backward path of the same length (`PathN.reverse`); and backward
BFS at the same default fuel finds it (`bfsClosure_complete`). Both closures run at fuel `100`, so
the path length that soundness bounds is exactly the one completeness can spend.

The second component of the `.splitOrdered` progress measure. `timeLinearity` fires exactly while
an incomparable pair remains, and its two `addFuture` arms leave the *branch* literally unchanged
— so the only thing that can be moving there is the ordering, and what it moves is the count of
incomparable pairs among the branch's known times.

`incomparableB` transcribes `firstIncomparablePair`'s own test **verbatim** rather than
re-deriving an equivalent one. That is deliberate: the measure must not be able to drift from the
trigger it is meant to track. -/

**What the trigger guarantees, `some` direction.** The companion to
`comparable_of_firstIncomparablePair_none`: when `timeLinearity` does fire, the pair it reports is
a genuine pair of branch times, distinct, and incomparable in both directions.

/-! ## The world dimension

`chain_le_worlds_times` leaves two cardinalities; the time one is discharged above. This section
discharges the **world** one — a dimension neither T1 nor T2 touches, since T1 bounds formulas and
T2 bounds times.

### Why worlds are bounded at all, and by what

Exactly two rules mint fresh worlds: `boxNeg` (on `F(□ψ)`) and `diamondPos` (on `T(◇ψ)`); every
other `ruleMintsFreshLabel` constructor mints a fresh *time*. Neither modal rule carries an
internal guard — `applyRule`'s `boxNeg` arm returns `.linear (witness :: …)` unconditionally — so
what stops them re-firing is `findApplicableRule`, which gates every `ruleMintsFreshLabel` rule
behind `witnessPresent`.

The shape of that gate is the whole argument, and it differs between the modal and temporal arms:

    -- modal (boxNeg): quantified over EVERY known world
    branch.knownWorlds.any fun w => branch.contains (.neg ψ { world := w, time := l.time })

    -- temporal (allFutureNeg): world HELD FIXED, quantified over times
    (timeOrd.futureOf l.time).any fun t => branch.contains (.neg ψ { world := l.world, time := t })

The modal guard is *world-indifferent*. Once any world at all carries `F(ψ)` at time `t`, no
`F(□ψ)` at time `t` mints again — not at that world, and not at any other. That is the S5
universal-accessibility discipline showing up as a termination fact: a minted world is identified
by the **sign, formula and time** of the witness it was minted for, and never by its own index.
So the non-seed worlds inject into signed formulas over the stock with the world component
normalised away, giving `2 * |C| * |times|` of them.

### Consequence for `soundFuel'` — stated, not glossed

The bound below is `|S| + 2 * |C| * |times|`, and with T2's time bound that is
`|S| + 2 * |C| * 2 ^ (2 * |C|)`. It is emphatically **not** `1`. Feeding it through
`chain_le_worlds_of_linearity_saturated` gives `chain_le_worlds_bounded`, whose figure exceeds
`soundFuel' φ = 2 * n * 2 ^ (2 * n)` by a factor of about `2 * |C| * 2 ^ (2 * |C|)`, because
`soundFuel'` has no world factor in it at all. `soundFuel'` is therefore adequate only for runs
that stay in one world; the general figure is `chain_le_worlds_bounded`'s. Redefining `soundFuel'`
is a plan-level decision and is not taken here — but no claim below asserts `soundFuel'` suffices
in the presence of fresh worlds.

**The S5 fresh-world discipline, as a branch invariant.**

Outside a seed set `S` of worlds, every world of `b` carries a witness confined to the stock `C`
and to a time `b` mentions, and distinct such worlds carry witnesses with *distinct signatures*.
The injectivity clause is the content: it is precisely what `witnessPresent`'s world-indifferent
modal arms enforce, since a second world minted for the same sign/formula/time would have found
the first one's witness and been suppressed.

This is stated as an invariant rather than derived from the rule set because deriving it is a
36-case induction over `applyRule` of the same shape and size as T1 (`SubformulaProperty.lean`),
and belongs with that work rather than with the counting argument it feeds.
-/
def WorldWitness (C : Finset Formula) (S : Finset WorldIndex) (b : Branch) : Prop :=
  ∃ wit : WorldIndex → SignedFormula,

    (∀ w₁ ∈ b.worldFinset, w₁ ∉ S → ∀ w₂ ∈ b.worldFinset, w₂ ∉ S →
      witnessSig (wit w₁) = witnessSig (wit w₂) → w₁ = w₂)

/--
**The world bound.** A branch under the fresh-world discipline has at most
`|S| + 2 * |C| * |times|` worlds: the seed, plus one per witness signature available over the
stock and the branch's own times.

The counting is the same shape as `branch_card_le` — inject into `signedUniverse` and apply
`card_signedUniverse_le` — run against `timeLabels` rather than the full label set, which is
exactly where the world-indifference of the modal guard is spent.

`OrderDual` is now discharged by `orderDual_holds`, but the rows are kept: they are what caught
the condition being true before the proof existed, and they remain the cheapest check that the
*statement* still says what it should on the shapes the engine actually builds: a chain
(`addFuture` repeated), a fork, a diamond, and a chain put through `identifyTime` — the one
operation that rewrites constraints rather than adding them, and hence the one most likely to
break a duality.

**The fuel figure is justified in the dimension proved.**

`soundFuel'` was *defined* in this file as `2 * n * 2 ^ (2 * n)`, and its docstring is careful to
say the figure is stated rather than earned. This is the theorem that earns it, for unbranched
runs: with `C` the formula stock and the label count at the T2 figure `2 ^ (2 * |C|)`, the step
bound `chain_le_stock` delivers is exactly `soundFuel'` at any `φ` whose closure has `|C|`
members. The two hypotheses that remain are `hl` (labels confined) and `hL` (their count at the
T2 figure).

**`hL` is not dischargeable in general, and this is where that becomes visible.** T2 bounds
*times* by `2 ^ (2 * |C|)` (`timeFinset_card_le_of_not_blocked`), but `L` here is a set of
**labels**, and a label is a world *and* a time. So `hL` asks for `|worlds| * |times|` to sit
under the T2 *time* figure, which holds only when the run stays in a single world. The world
count is bounded — `worldFinset_card_le` gives `|S| + 2 * |C| * |times|` — but it is not `1`, so
`hL` fails as soon as any `boxNeg` or `diamondPos` fires.

The theorem is still true as stated; `hL` is a hypothesis, not a claim. What is *not* available
is a route from T2 to `hL` in the presence of fresh worlds, and therefore `soundFuel'` is not the
general fuel figure. `chain_le_worlds_bounded` is: it takes the world dimension as a dimension
rather than assuming it away, and its figure exceeds `soundFuel' φ` by about
`2 * |C| * 2 ^ (2 * |C|)`.

/-! ## 4.3c — `expandBranchWithFuel` does not exhaust

The plan's named deliverable was `buildTableau_isSome` at `soundFuel'`, and it is **false as
stated**: `buildTableau` calls `expandBranchWithFuel` at the default `maxBranches := 50000`, whose
very first line returns `none` once `branchesUsed` reaches that figure, at *any* fuel whatsoever.
The corrected statement quantifies over the branch budget instead of inheriting the default, which
is what this section proves. The engine is untouched — `maxBranches = 50000` is a deliberate
runtime guard, and the wave-3 territory contract forbids editing it.

Three things can make `expandBranchWithFuel` report `none`, and a true theorem has to rule out all
three: the branch-budget guard, fuel exhaustion, and a `none` propagated out of a split arm's
fold. The theorem below rules out the first by hypothesis (`branchesUsed + fuel ≤ maxBranches`),
the second by the T3 progress measure (the run cannot take more steps than the universe has
members), and the third by confining attention to runs that never split. The splitting case is a
genuinely separate obligation — it needs `resolveOpenArm`, which has its own `none` — and is
recorded as such rather than waved at.
-/

/--
An invariant on branches under which the engine's step never splits, and which survives an
extending step.

Stated as a predicate rather than as a property of one run because that is what the induction on
fuel consumes: the recursion re-enters at the *new* branch with a *new* ordering and tracker, so
whatever is assumed at the start has to be re-established there, for all such parameters.

/--
**4.3c, corrected form.** With the branch budget quantified and enough fuel to outlast the finite
universe, an unbranched expansion never reports `none`.

The fuel hypothesis `U.card < b.toFinset.card + fuel` is exactly the T3 progress measure in the
form the induction needs: every extending step consumes one unit of fuel *and* adds at least one
member to the branch-as-a-set, and the branch cannot exceed `U`, so the fuel outlasts the run. At
`fuel = 0` the hypothesis is already contradictory, which is why the base case is discharged
rather than being the place the theorem fails.

The branch-budget hypothesis `branchesUsed + fuel ≤ maxBranches` is the honest replacement for the
plan's silent reliance on the default: each extending step increments `branchesUsed` by one and
decrements `fuel` by one, so the sum is invariant and the guard `branchesUsed ≥ maxBranches` is
never reached.

This is the form a caller uses: exhibit a stock `C` (by `decide`, via
`tableauClosed_of_closureStep_subset`), a label set `L`, a branch budget, and the theorem returns
totality of the expansion. Note that the fuel figure that suffices is `2 * |C| * |L|` — the step
bound of `chain_le_stock` — and `chain_le_soundFuel'` is what identifies that with `soundFuel' φ`
once the label count sits at the T2 figure.

`expandBranchWithFuel_isSome_of_noSplit` is stated over a hypothetical invariant `P`, and
`P := fun _ => False` would satisfy `NoSplit` vacuously — so the theorem is worth exactly as much
as the existence of a satisfying `P` with an inhabited branch. The witness below supplies one
outright, and it is not artificial: the empty branch is the engine's own starting shape before any
seed formula is placed, and it is `saturated` at every ordering, frame class and tracker because
all three pick stages scan the branch itself.

/-! ## 4.3d residual 3 — the branching arms: what the budget costs, and what the *fuel* costs

The budget half of this residual is exactly as report 06 §4 describes, and the description is
confirmed here: in both split arms `branchesUsed'` is a `let` bound **once, before** the fold
(`Saturation.lean:646, :675`) and the *same* value reaches every sibling (`:654, :681`), while the
fold's accumulator carries only the `Option` and no counter. Sibling usage is therefore not
accumulated — the budget is **path-shaped**, and the linear invariant
`branchesUsed + β * fuel ≤ maxBranches` is preserved by every arm. `splitBudget_preserved` below
is that preservation, with `β` a hypothesis on `branches.length` rather than the literal `3`
(`3` is the currently *measured* maximum — `orderTrichotomy`'s three disjuncts and
`timeLinearity`'s three arms — and a census is not a theorem).

**But the budget is not the binding constraint in the split arms, and the fuel is.** This is new,
and it corrects the residual's "orthogonal to the fuel figure" framing. Source:

* `estimateBranchDifficulty` (`Saturation.lean:360-364`) is `1 + 3*tempCount + 2*modCount + len/4`,
  so it is **always ≥ 1** — no arm is ever starved to `0` by a zero difficulty.
* `allocateFuelProportionally (fuel+1) branches` hands each arm
  `min (max 1 (fuel.succ * d / max 1 totalDifficulty)) fuel` — a **proportional share**, and the
  arms' difficulties sum to `totalDifficulty`, so `k` arms of equal difficulty each receive about
  `fuel / k`, not `fuel`.
* The split arms recurse at `min pair.2 fuel` (`:653, :680`).

So a sub-branch that still needs `m` extending steps receives roughly `fuel / k` units, and the
progress-measure hypothesis `U.card < b.toFinset.card + fuel` that
`expandBranchWithFuel_isSome_of_noSplit` consumes is **not** re-established at the arms by any
amount of parent fuel that is merely `> U.card`. Fuel adequate for a split run scales like
`β ^ depth * worldFuel'`, and `depth` is not bounded by anything proved here. The split arms
therefore **multiply** the fuel figure; they do not sit beside it.

This is the same *class* of fact as the 4.3b blocker (`buildTableau_isSome` is false at the engine
default `maxBranches`): a real property of a deliberate engine policy, not a gap in a proof. The
engine is untouched — the wave-3 territory contract forbids editing `allocateFuelProportionally`,
and the proportional policy is there for good `#eval` reasons. Accordingly `NoSplit` **stays** the
named hypothesis confining the arms, exactly as `expandBranchWithFuel_isSome_of_stock` and
`expandBranchWithFuel_isSome_at_worldFuel'` carry it. What is discharged here is the budget half,
which is real and reusable; what is *named* is the arm-fuel shortfall, with executable rows so it
is evidence rather than assertion.
-/

/--
**Every arm gets at least one unit of fuel.** The allocation's `max 1` floor survives the `min`
whenever the parent had at least two units, so no arm is starved outright — the shortfall
documented above is proportional, not degenerate.
-/

    (hf : 0 < fuel) (h : n ∈ allocateFuelProportionally (fuel + 1) branches) : 1 ≤ n := by

/--
**The path-shaped budget invariant is preserved by a split.** Entering with
`branchesUsed + β * (fuel + 1) ≤ maxBranches` and splitting into at most `β` arms, every arm —
which receives `branchesUsed + branches.length` and at most `fuel` units — still satisfies
`branchesUsed' + β * fuel ≤ maxBranches`.

`β` enters as a hypothesis on `branches.length`, not as the literal `3`: `3` is the measured
maximum over the current rule set, and a rule added later could break it, so the coefficient is
carried rather than baked in. Note this needs no fact about the *fold*, precisely because the
siblings do not accumulate each other's usage.

/-! ### 4.3d(i) — what a split arm inherits, and what it does *not*

The unsplit induction's progress measure is `U.card < b.toFinset.card + fuel`, and re-establishing
it at a split arm needs two things: the arm must be strictly larger as a set (so the `U.card`
side has room), and the arm's fuel allocation must be large enough (so the `fuel` side does).
This subsection settles the first question for both split constructors — and the answers differ,
which is the finding.
-/

/-- The pick-tail of `expandOnceUnblocked` reports `.split` only from a `.branching` rule result,
and the arms it reports are that result's arms appended to the branch.

Stated over an abstract `pick` for the same reason `pick_extended` is (Tableau.lean): a hypothesis
about the three-stage `match` as a whole is not something the per-stage lemmas can consume. -/

/-! ### The strict `.split` growth, in three cases

`expandOnceUnblocked_split_card_le` above is non-strict, and a `.split` depth bound needs the
strict version. What supplies it is `findApplicableRule`'s `.branching` guard — but that guard has
**exactly two bypasses**, `ruleSelfGuarded` and `ruleMintsFreshLabel`, so the argument splits into
three cases rather than one:

1. **ordinary rules** — the `bss.any (fun fs => fs.all branch.contains)` guard rejects the result
   outright when some arm adds nothing, so every accepted arm carries a formula the branch lacks;
2. **`ruleSelfGuarded`** (`.untlNeg`, `.snceNeg`) — their surviving ACTIVE arm mints
   `branch.nextTime` and emits at it, so each arm's head sits at a time the branch does not carry;
3. **`ruleMintsFreshLabel`** (`.untlPos`, `.sncePos` among the branching rules) — same argument.

Cases 2 and 3 share one lemma (`applyRule_branching_arms_fresh`) because they share the witness:
`Branch.nextTime`, and `not_mem_of_time_nextTime`.

The other two pick stages cannot reach this lemma at all: `serialityRule` reports only
`.notApplicable`/`.persistent`, and `timeLinearity` only `.notApplicable`/`.branchingOrdered`, so

**A `.split` arm is strictly larger than the branch, as a set.**

The strict companion of `expandOnceUnblocked_split_card_le`, which stays in place unmodified —
this lemma is purely additive. It is what bounds `.split` depth by `|U|`: each split level adds a
formula from the finite universe, so a run cannot split more than `|U|` times without repeating.

Contrast with `.splitOrdered`, where the analogous statement is **false** (see
`applyRule_timeLinearity_arms`): ordered-split arms replace rather than extend, and arm 3 can
shrink the branch. That asymmetry is exactly why `splitOrderedMeasure` exists.

**An ordered split hands its arms through untouched.** There is no `++ b`: the arms of a
`.branchingOrdered` result *are* branches, supplied by the rule.

This is the negative half of this subsection, and it is load-bearing. `timeLinearity` is the only
rule producing `.branchingOrdered`, and its three arms are
`(branch, ord.addFuture t₁ t₂)`, `(branch, ord.addFuture t₂ t₁)` and
`(branch.identifyTime (min t₁ t₂) (max t₁ t₂), ord.identifyTime (min t₁ t₂) (max t₁ t₂))` — the
first two carry the branch **unchanged**, and the third *identifies two times*, which can only
merge signed formulas and so cannot increase `toFinset.card` either. (Arm 3 is oriented: it retires
the smaller numeral, which is what keeps `Branch.maxTime` from falling. The orientation is
invisible to this lemma's content — a merge cannot grow the branch whichever way round it runs —
but it is why the arm reads `min`/`max` rather than `t₂`/`t₁`.) `findApplicableRule` adds no output-presence guard on
this constructor and says in its own comment why one is impossible: "the arms of an ordered split
are replacement branches, so 'the branch already contains this arm's output' is trivially true of
every arm that adds no formula, which is every arm of the only rule that produces this
constructor."

**Consequence.** There is no `.splitOrdered` analogue of `expandOnceUnblocked_card_lt`, and there
cannot be one: branch cardinality is constant (or decreasing) across an ordered split. What makes
that rule terminate is its own self-suppression — once every pair of known times is comparable
there is no candidate pair and it reports `.notApplicable` — a *comparability* measure on the
ordering, not a cardinality measure on the branch. Any argument that bounds split depth by branch
growth therefore covers `.split` only, and needs a second, order-theoretic measure for
`.splitOrdered`.

/-! ### The identification arm, and the lexicographic measure

`applyRule .timeLinearity`'s third arm rewrites both the branch and the ordering. What the measure
uses of it is only the *branch* half: identification retires one time outright, so the first
component of the measure strictly drops and the arm is discharged there.

**`timeLinearity` is the only rule producing `.branchingOrdered`** — `applyRule`'s
`.timeLinearity` case (`Tableau.lean:1513-1520`) is its sole construction site, and
`findApplicableRule`'s own `.branchingOrdered` arm records the same fact ("the only rule that
produces this constructor"). So the decrease theorem below covers every ordered split the engine
can take. -/

Membership and distinctness are symmetric in the pair, so the orientation costs exactly one case
split on `Nat.le_total` and no new content. That is the whole reason the plan rated the

**The `.splitOrdered` progress measure**, lexicographic in `(|knownTimes|, |incomparable pairs|)`.

This is the direct replacement for the refuted branch-cardinality route (see the do-not-re-attempt
register): branch cardinality is monotone-*non-increasing* across an ordered split — arm 3 merges
signed formulas — so it cannot bound ordered-split depth. The lexicographic pair can, because the
two arms that leave the branch alone strictly shrink the ordering's incomparability, and the arm
that rewrites the ordering strictly shrinks the branch's time set.

**Why there is no missing fact about `identifyTime`'s output ordering.** A reader looking for a
proof that `TimeOrdering.identifyTime`'s constraint substitution preserves comparability of the
surviving times will not find one, and should not go looking: arm 3 is discharged *entirely* on
the first component. Nothing anywhere in this development needs to know what the rewritten
ordering looks like. That is the whole point of making the measure lexicographic rather than
trying to run the incomparable-pair count across all three arms.

**Scope.** The measure bounds ordered-split depth *between fresh-time mints*, not globally:
`.split` can mint fresh times and so raise the first component. See the split-aware fuel figure
for how that residual is carried (`hT`) rather than hidden.
-/
def splitOrderedMeasure (b : Branch) (ord : TimeOrdering) : Nat × Nat :=

/--
**The measure strictly decreases at every arm of an ordered split.**

Arms 1 and 2 (`addFuture`) keep the branch literally unchanged, so the first component is equal
and the second strictly drops (`incompPairs_lt_addFuture`); arm 3 (`identifyTime`) drops the
first component outright (`knownTimes_card_lt_identifyTime`, instantiated at the oriented pair via
`firstIncomparablePair_spec_oriented`). Since `timeLinearity` is the only producer of
`.branchingOrdered`, this covers every ordered split the engine takes.

The orientation does not reach this proof: `knownTimes_card_lt_identifyTime` is quantified over
both of its times and asks only for membership and distinctness, so retiring the smaller numeral
drops the time count exactly as retiring `t₂` did.

**Split arity, proved: `β = 3` is a theorem, not a census.**

Every `.split` reported by the engine's step has at most three arms. The route is the same
three-stage pick destructuring `expandOnceUnblocked_pick_ne_nil` uses: whichever stage supplied
the rule, its extraction lemma turns the pick back into an `applyRule` equation, and
`applyRule_branching_arity_le` bounds the arms there.

**This does not license baking `3` in anywhere.** `splitBudget_preserved` and the lemmas around
it still carry `β` as a hypothesis, deliberately: a rule added later could return four arms, and
the point of carrying the coefficient is that such a rule would break exactly one lemma — this
one — rather than silently invalidating everything stated at the literal.

**Every arm's fuel allocation is at least `m`**, provided the parent's fuel covers `m` copies of
the arms' total difficulty and `m` fits under the termination cap.

The two hypotheses are exactly the two ways the allocation can fall short. `hT` is the
proportional-share condition: an arm of difficulty `d ≥ 1` out of a total `T` receives
`(fuel+1) * d / T ≥ (fuel+1) / T`, and `T * m ≤ fuel + 1` is precisely what makes that at least
`m`. `hm` is the termination cap: the allocation is `min … fuel`, so nothing above `fuel` is
obtainable no matter how favourable the proportion.

This is the lower bound `allocateFuelProportionally_pos` is the `m = 1` case of, and it is what a
split-aware progress argument has to consume.

**The total difficulty of a split, bounded by arity and a per-arm difficulty bound.**

This is what makes `allocateFuelProportionally_ge`'s hypothesis `T * m ≤ fuel + 1`
dischargeable from bounded quantities rather than from an unbounded one: `T ≤ D * β`, where `β`
bounds the arity and `D` bounds any single arm's difficulty.

**Why `D` is carried abstractly rather than computed.** `estimateBranchDifficulty` is
`1 + 3 * tempCount + 2 * modCount + len / 4`, and both counting functions (`temporalCount`,
`modalCount`) are `private` to `Saturation.lean`, so a finer bound in terms of per-formula
complexity cannot be *stated* from this file without changing their visibility — a change to an
existing declaration, which this addition deliberately does not make. `D` is therefore the
interface: a caller that can bound one arm's difficulty gets the total, and `estimateBranchDifficulty`
is monotone enough in branch content that such a bound follows from a universe bound.

/-! ### 4.3d(iii) — the split folds preserve `isSome`

The structural half of removing `NoSplit`, separated from the quantitative half. Both of
`expandBranchWithFuel`'s split folds short-circuit on the first arm reported genuinely open and
otherwise thread the accumulator, so what they need to preserve `isSome` is exactly two facts per
arm — and both are carried as **abstract hypotheses** so the quantitative phases can supply them
without restating the fold reasoning.

**`resolveOpenArm = none` is genuinely reachable, and is carried, not assumed away.** By the
landed `resolveOpenArm_eq_none_imp`, the only surviving route to `none` is its final "still not
saturated" arm: `saturateBlocked` returned an open branch that `findClosure` does not close and
that is still not saturated in the blocking-aware sense. That is precisely the configuration the
refuted unconditional `buildTableau_isSome` died on (`φ = F(G p)`), so it is a live outcome, not a
dead one. It therefore appears as the named per-arm hypothesis `hres` below rather than being
proved away. Any caller of these lemmas must discharge it, and cannot do so by accident.

**And no fuel figure can rescue that witness — the obstruction is stationary, not budgetary.**
This was measured directly on `φ = F(G p)` at `.Base`, and it forecloses the obvious wrong move
of raising a figure until the counterexample goes away:

* `expandBranchWithFuel [F φ @ initial] n TimeOrdering.empty .Base` *succeeds* at every
  `n ≥ 25` tested (`25, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2048, 4096`) and returns the **same**
  21-formula open branch each time. The branch is stationary in the fuel; more fuel provably
  buys nothing.
* `findUnexpanded` on that branch is `some _` at every one of those fuels, so the branch never
  becomes saturated and `buildTableau` falls into its final "still not saturated" arm and
  returns `none` — the very arm `resolveOpenArm_eq_none_imp` isolates.
* The residue is identifiable, and identical at fuel 25, 100 and 4096. Before
  `saturateBlocked` the unexpanded formula is `F(G p) @ (0,4)`; after it (branch grown 21 → 25)
  it is `T(F ¬p) @ (0,4)`, i.e. `T(untl ⊤ (p → ⊥))`. That is an **unfulfilled eventuality at a
  blocked time**: blocking has stopped the engine minting new times, while `untlPos` remains
  applicable at that label, so the `findUnexpanded … = none` certificate can never be produced
  at any budget whatsoever.
* `Decidability/Tableau.lean`'s `trivialEventWitnessed` does not suppress this eventuality, and
  correctly so — that guard keys on the *syntactic* `event == Formula.top`, and here the event
  is `¬p`. It is the guard that lets `(G p) → □(G p)` saturate (see `soundFuel'`); it does not
  and should not reach this one.

So `hres` is not a hypothesis awaiting a large enough constant. Discharging it requires an
argument about eventuality fulfilment under blocking, not an arithmetic one. -/

arm's `resolveOpenArm` settlement does. Stated over abstract per-arm hypotheses: no `worldFuel'`,

/-! ### 4.3d(iv) — the carried time bound `hT`, and the split-aware fuel figure

#### `hT` is a bound, not an exclusion — and specifically it is not `NoSplit` renamed

`NoSplit P fc` **forbids** the split constructors outright: it says the engine's step at any
`P`-branch is never `.split` and never `.splitOrdered`. Any theorem carrying it is therefore
*vacuous on branching runs* — it says nothing whatsoever about the behaviour this task exists to
establish.

`TimeBounded P Tmax` says something entirely different. It **permits both split constructors**
and merely quantifies the time dimension: the branches the invariant admits carry at most `Tmax`
distinct times. It is the same kind of hypothesis as the `hU : ∀ b, P b → ∀ x ∈ b, x ∈ U` that
`expandBranchWithFuel_isSome_of_noSplit` already carries — a finiteness bound on a dimension the
progress measure ranges over — and nobody calls `hU` a vacuity. A theorem carrying `hT` still
applies to runs that branch, and the branching non-vacuity witness is the mechanical check of
that claim: a theorem that only applied to unbranching runs would have removed `NoSplit` in name
only.

#### Why a naive combination of the two split measures fails, and why `hT` is needed to break it

Do not retry the following, in either ordering. The two split constructors have progress
measures that move in *opposite* directions on each other's dimension:

* `.split` **grows the branch strictly** (`expandOnceUnblocked_split_card_lt`) — but it can also
  **mint fresh times**. `untlPos` and `sncePos` are branching rules *and* are in
  `ruleMintsFreshLabel`; `untlNeg`/`snceNeg` are `ruleSelfGuarded` with their passive arms
  retired, so they fire only through an ACTIVE arm that also mints. So `.split` raises
  `|knownTimes|` and thereby *resets the ordering measure upward*.
* `.splitOrdered` **strictly drops the lexicographic ordering measure**
  (`splitOrderedMeasure_lt_of_timeLinearity`) — but its third arm `identifyTime`s two times,
  which merges signed formulas and can therefore **shrink the branch**, handing back universe
  budget the `.split` measure had spent.

So neither measure bounds the other, and no weighted sum of the two decreases at all four kinds
of step: arm 3 needs the `knownTimes` weight to dominate the branch-cardinality weight, while an
extending or splitting step needs the branch-cardinality weight to dominate the `knownTimes`
weight. `hT` exists precisely to break that circularity — it caps the ordering dimension
*a priori* rather than asking the branch dimension to pay for it. -/

**The ordered-run bound, DERIVED rather than assumed.**

Plan 02's Phase 10 wrote this figure as `Tmax + Tmax²` and instructed that it be *derived* from
the measure's own range before use, using the derived value and recording any divergence. The
derivation gives a different — larger — figure, and it is the derived one that is used here:

  `orderedRunBound Tmax = Tmax * (Tmax * Tmax + 1) + Tmax * Tmax`

i.e. `Tmax³ + Tmax² + Tmax`, not `Tmax² + Tmax`. The reason is that the two components compose
*multiplicatively*, not additively: each of the at most `Tmax` drops of component 1 can be
followed by a fresh run of up to `Tmax²` drops of component 2, because component 2 is *reset*
(not merely continued) whenever component 1 drops. `splitOrderedRank_le` is the machine-checked
statement of the range.

**The split-aware fuel figure.**

Deliberately a *new name*: `soundFuel'` and `worldFuel'` are frozen and are not overloaded here.

Two independent costs are combined. The **path** cost is `splitPathBound`, the longest chain of
engine steps the two measures jointly admit. The **decay** cost is the fuel a split arm actually
receives: `allocateFuelProportionally` hands each arm a *proportional* share, and
`allocateFuelProportionally_ge` with `totalDifficulty_le` says an arm is guaranteed `m` units
only when `D * β * m ≤ fuel + 1`, where `β` bounds the split arity and `D` bounds a single arm's
`estimateBranchDifficulty`. So the available fuel is divided by up to `D * β` at every split, and
over a path of length `splitPathBound` that is a factor of `(D * β + 1) ^ splitPathBound`.

`β` stays a **carried parameter**. The literal `3` is not baked in anywhere, even though
`expandOnceUnblocked_split_arity_le` now proves it: a rule added later could return four arms,
and the point of carrying the coefficient is that such a rule breaks exactly one lemma rather
than silently invalidating every figure stated at the literal.

/-! #### MEASURED OBSTRUCTION: this figure is *not* yet known to suffice

Read this before attempting `NoSplit`-free totality of `expandBranchWithFuel` at this figure.
The attempt was made against the real proof state and it does **not** close. The obstruction is
sharp, and it is not a missing tactic.

The unsplit induction's invariant is `U.card < b.toFinset.card + fuel`. A `.splitOrdered` arm
recurses at `min alloc fuel`, where `allocateFuelProportionally` hands out only a *proportional*
share, so any workable invariant has to make the two split measures pay for that division. The
natural candidate is the combined potential

  `Ψ(b, ord) = (|U| − |b|) * (orderedRunBound Tmax + 1) + splitOrderedRank Tmax b ord`

and it is preserved at three of the four arms:

* `.extended` and `.split` — `|b|` strictly grows (`expandOnceUnblocked_card_lt`,
  `expandOnceUnblocked_split_card_lt`), so the first term drops by a full `orderedRunBound + 1`,
  which outweighs any rise in the rank (`splitOrderedRank_le` bounds that rise by
  `orderedRunBound`);
* `.splitOrdered` arms 1-2 — `|b|` is *literally* unchanged and the rank strictly drops
  (`splitOrderedRank_lt_of_timeLinearity`).

It **fails at `.splitOrdered` arm 3**. There `identifyTime` can shrink the branch, so the first
term *grows* by `s * (orderedRunBound + 1)` for the merge count `s`, while the rank is only
guaranteed to drop by `1`. `Ψ` therefore rises.

Re-weighting does not rescue it, and the failure is circular rather than accidental. Making the
`knownTimes` weight dominate `(orderedRunBound + 1) * |U|` fixes arm 3 — but then an extending or
splitting step that mints one fresh time raises `knownTimes` by `1` and so costs more than the
`(orderedRunBound + 1)` its branch growth pays. Each ordering of the weights is broken by the
other constructor. This is the same circularity recorded above under "why a naive combination
fails"; what is new here is the finding that **`hT` does not break it after all**. `hT` caps the
ordering dimension's *value*; it does not stop `identifyTime` from *returning universe budget* to
the branch dimension, which is what arm 3 does.

What would unblock it is a bound on the branch shrinkage at `identifyTime` — or, independently, a
bound on the number of fresh-time mints along a path that is not itself stated in terms of branch
growth. Neither is available in this file today, and neither is supplied by any landed lemma.
`splitAwareFuel`, `splitPathBound` and `orderedRunBound` are therefore **definitions whose

/-! ## 4.3e — the general fuel figure `worldFuel'`

`soundFuel'` is the **single-world** figure: `chain_le_soundFuel'` earns it exactly, with no
slack, but only under a label hypothesis `hL` that asks `|worlds| * |times|` to sit under the T2
*time* bound — true only while the run stays in one world. Once any `boxNeg`/`diamondPos` mints a
world, the honest bound is `chain_le_worlds_bounded`'s, and the arithmetic below shows the two
differ by a *squaring*, not a constant: writing `F := soundFuel' φ` and `s := |S|`,

    2 * |C| * ((s + 2 * |C| * 2 ^ (2 * |C|)) * 2 ^ (2 * |C|))  =  F * (s + F)

on the nose, so at the engine's own seed (`buildTableau`'s
`initialBranch = [SignedFormula.neg φ Label.initial]` — one world, one time, so `s = 1`) the
general figure is `F * (F + 1)`. Two figures a squaring apart must not share a name, so
`soundFuel'` is kept frozen — name *and* body — and the general figure gets its own name here.

`s` is deliberately **not** specialised to `1` in the definition: `chain_le_worlds_bounded`
quantifies the seed world set `S` universally, and `chain_le_worldFuel'` has to consume it in that
form. The engine's singleton seed is a fact about one caller, not about the figure.

**Three hypotheses survive into this section and are named in the statements rather than absorbed
into the figure**, because a figure that hid them would let a later dispatch claim a world bound
that assumes itself:

* `WorldWitness` (`hww`) — an *invariant*, not a theorem (see its docstring: deriving it is a
  36-case induction over `applyRule`). `chain_le_worldFuel'` carries it, as `chain_le_worlds_bounded`
  does.
* `NoSplit` — the branching arms are still confined, not discharged.
* `maxBranches` — **quantified**, never the engine default. `buildTableau_isSome` at the default
  `50000` is false at any fuel whatsoever, and nothing here reopens it.

**The general fuel figure**, in the presence of fresh worlds.

By `worldFuel'_eq` this is *definitionally* `chain_le_worlds_bounded`'s right-hand side, so
`chain_le_worldFuel'` is a restatement rather than an estimate. `s` is the seed-world count.

See `soundFuel'` for the single-world figure and the section preamble for why they are two names.

def worldFuel' (φ : Formula) (s : Nat) : Nat :=
  (s + soundFuel' φ) * soundFuel' φ

/--
**The figure is the chain bound, exactly.** Not an estimate: with
`c := |subformulaClosure φ|` and `m := 2 ^ (2 * c)`,

    2 * c * ((s + 2 * c * m) * m) = (2 * c * m) * (s + 2 * c * m) = soundFuel' φ * (s + soundFuel' φ)

by associativity and commutativity alone. This is what lets `chain_le_worldFuel'` consume
`chain_le_worlds_bounded` with no arithmetic slack.

**The chain bound at the named general figure.** `chain_le_worlds_bounded`, restated so that
downstream has a computable `Nat` to hand `expandBranchWithFuel` rather than a five-factor
expression to re-inline.

Hypotheses are unchanged from `chain_le_worlds_bounded` — **including `hww : WorldWitness C S
(run n)`, which is an invariant and is not discharged here** — plus `hφ` identifying the stock's
cardinality with the closure's, which is what turns the bound's `|C|` into `soundFuel' φ`'s `n`.

**The 4.3 terminus.** `expandBranchWithFuel_isSome_of_stock` instantiated at the general figure.

This is instantiation, not new mathematics: the label-side hypothesis
`|L| ≤ (s + 2*|C|*2^(2|C|)) * 2^(2|C|)` yields `2 * |C| * |L| ≤ worldFuel' φ s` by
`worldFuel'_eq`'s identity, which is exactly what `expandBranchWithFuel_isSome_of_stock`'s
`hfuel` wants.

All three residuals stay visible in the statement, as the section preamble requires: `NoSplit`
confines the branching arms, `maxBranches` is quantified with an explicit budget hypothesis, and
the world dimension enters through the caller's `hL` — which `worldFinset_card_le` supplies only
from a `WorldWitness` the caller must itself provide.
