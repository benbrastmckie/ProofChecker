# The mint bound — an independent ceiling on fresh-time minting

`Fuel.lean` (T3) turns the formula stock (T1) and the time-type bound (T2) into a fuel figure at
which `expandBranchWithFuel` cannot exhaust, but its totality theorem
`expandBranchWithFuel_isSome_of_noSplit` is scoped to runs that never branch. Lifting that scope
needs a bound on the number of **fresh-time mints** along a run that is independent of branch
growth, because at an ordered split's third arm (`Branch.identifyTime`) the branch shrinks as a
set and the branch-cardinality measure the extending case relies on is not available.

This module supplies that bound in four blocks.

## A. The irreflexivity invariant (`IrreflOrd`)

Witness preservation across the identification arm is **conditional** on the ordering carrying no
self-loop. That is not a convenience hypothesis: `TimeOrdering.identifyTime` drops every
constraint whose two components rename to the same index, including a pre-existing `(a, a)`, and
a witness reachable only around such a self-loop is destroyed. The counterexample
`witnessPresent_identifyTime_unconditional_false` below refutes the unconditional form outright.
`IrreflOrd` is therefore established as an engine-level run invariant before anything is built on
top of it.

## B. Reachability transport and witness preservation

`futureOf`/`pastOf` reachability transports along the identification renaming `rho`, length
preserving, so a witness found at one fuel figure is re-found at the same one. That lifts to
`witnessPresent` for all eight fresh-label rules, with every other rule covered by a *proved*
vacuity rather than an assumed one.

## C. The mint potential

The count of `(rule, signed formula)` pairs still eligible to mint. Witness preservation makes it
non-increasing along a run and a mint makes it strictly decrease, which is what converts "each
pair mints at most once" into a per-state measure an induction can carry.

## D. The amortized counting chain

`#mints`, `#identifications`, total shrinkage, and `#extensions`, each bounded absolutely, feeding
the branch-budget-carrying restatement of the totality theorem and its terminus at
`buildTableauAt`.

## Placement

Everything here is downstream of `Fuel.lean` and purely additive: no declaration in
`Fuel.lean`, `Saturation.lean`, or `Tableau.lean` is edited, and in particular `buildTableau`,
its default fuel, and `expandBranchWithFuel`'s default branch cap are untouched.

between one and `100` edges, `PathN.reverse` turns it into a forward path of the same length
against `mem_directFutureOf_iff` read right-to-left, and `bfsClosure_complete` re-finds it at the
same default fuel. Both closures run at fuel `100`, so the length soundness bounds is exactly the

though `firstIncomparablePair`'s test — which `incomparableB` transcribes verbatim — is written
asymmetrically, as three conditions on the *ordered* pair.

The two closure conjuncts trade places under the duality rather than being preserved: `t₁ ∈
futureOf t₂` would give `t₂ ∈ pastOf t₁` by `orderDual_holds`, contradicting the *past* conjunct,
and `t₁ ∈ pastOf t₂` would give `t₂ ∈ futureOf t₁` by `orderDual_backward`, contradicting the
*future* one. That crossing is why both directions of the duality are needed and why only having
one of them is what made this look like a risk.

/-! ### `IrreflOrd` is NECESSARY, not merely convenient

`TimeOrdering.identifyTime` drops **every** constraint that collapses, including a pre-existing
self-loop `(a, a)` with `a ∉ {src, tgt}` — its two components rename to the same index. So a
witness reachable only around a self-loop is destroyed by the identification arm, and the
`IrreflOrd`-free form of `witnessPresent_identifyTime` is **false**, not merely unproved.

The four examples below are the machine-checked record of that. They belong on the
do-not-re-attempt register: a future reader who takes `IrreflOrd` for a cosmetic hypothesis and
drops it will be re-attempting a refuted statement. -/

/-- A self-loop carries reachability before identification. -/
example : (5 : TimeIndex) ∈ (TimeOrdering.mk [(5, 5)]).futureOf 5 := by decide

/-- …and that reachability is gone after it, because the self-loop is dropped. -/
example : (5 : TimeIndex) ∉ ((TimeOrdering.mk [(5, 5)]).identifyTime 1 0).futureOf 5 := by decide

/-- The incomparability side condition still holds in that configuration, so the failure is
attributable to the self-loop alone rather than to a violated trigger guarantee. -/
example : incomparableB (TimeOrdering.mk [(5, 5)]) (0, 1) = true := by decide

/-- **Counterexample to the `IrreflOrd`-free form of witness preservation.** With the
irreflexivity hypothesis dropped, `witnessPresent` for `allFutureNeg` is `true` before the
identification and `false` after it. -/
theorem witnessPresent_identifyTime_unconditional_false :
    letI p : Formula := .atom ⟨"p", none⟩
    letI sf : SignedFormula := ⟨.neg, Formula.allFuture p, ⟨0, 5⟩⟩
    letI wit : SignedFormula := ⟨.neg, p, ⟨0, 5⟩⟩
    letI b : Branch := [sf, wit]
    letI ord : TimeOrdering := ⟨[(5, 5)]⟩
    witnessPresent .allFutureNeg sf b ord = true ∧
      witnessPresent .allFutureNeg ⟨.neg, Formula.allFuture p, ⟨0, rho 1 0 5⟩⟩

/-! ## A2. `applyRule` preserves `IrreflOrd` -/

/-- A branch formula never sits at the branch's fresh time. This is the single freshness fact
every mint site reduces to, read off `not_mem_of_time_nextTime` contrapositively. -/
theorem time_ne_nextTime {b : Branch} {sf : SignedFormula} (h : sf ∈ b) :
    sf.label.time ≠ b.nextTime := fun hc => not_mem_of_time_nextTime hc h

set_option maxHeartbeats 4000000 in
/-- **Every rule except `densityRule` preserves ordering irreflexivity.**

`applyRule` mints a fresh time at exactly nine sites, all of the shape
`freshTime := branch.nextTime` followed by a single ordering edge between `sf.label.time` and
`freshTime` — five via `TimeOrdering.addFuture` and four via `TimeOrdering.addPast`. Each
reduces to `irreflOrd_addFuture` / `irreflOrd_addPast` applied to the one freshness fact
`time_ne_nextTime`. Every other rule threads the input ordering through unchanged, including
`timeLinearity`, whose `.branchingOrdered` result carries the per-arm orderings in the *result*
and returns the input ordering in the second component; the per-arm orderings are handled at
engine level rather than here.

`densityRule` is excluded because it is the sole **two-edge** site: it builds
`(ord.addFuture l.time freshTime).addFuture freshTime t'`, and the second edge needs
`freshTime ≠ t'`, which does not follow from freshness alone.

The `contradiction` alternative is load-bearing rather than defensive. `applyRule` is written as
one `match` over three discriminants with overlapping patterns, so `split` emits the arms of
*every* rule in each rule's case, each carrying a false discriminant equation such as
`TableauRule.impPos = TableauRule.densityRule`; `contradiction` is what discharges those
unreachable arms. It also discharges the genuine `densityRule` case from `hrule`. -/

`densityRule` is the sole two-edge mint site. Its second edge runs from the fresh time to a
target `t'` drawn from `ord.futureOf l.time`, so irreflexivity there needs `t' ≠ freshTime`,
which freshness alone does not give. The auxiliary invariant below is what supplies it: if every
time the ordering mentions is a time the branch already knows, then `t'` sits at or below
`b.maxTime`, strictly below the fresh time. -/

monotone in the branch, and that it dominates the fresh time once the witness is on the branch —
are not exported by `Tableau.lean` (`le_foldl_max` / `mem_le_foldl_max` there are `private`), so
the `≤`-direction is re-proved locally. -/

/-! ## A6. `OrdTimesLeMaxTime` at the branching shapes

This is the mirrored half of R1. A `.branching` step hands the *same* new ordering to every arm,
so an arm whose formula list omitted the fresh witness would hold an ordering edge to a time
absent from its own branch, and that arm's `nextTime` could then collide with the minted time.

The reading of the four branching mint sites is that this does not happen: `untlPos`, `sncePos`,
and the ACTIVE arms of `untlNeg` and `snceNeg` all build **both** arms at `freshLabel`, so each
arm's head already sits at the fresh time and dominates it. That reading is what the proof below
discharges — the `rfl` supplied for `hg` in each mint case is exactly the claim "this arm's head
sits at `b.nextTime`". -/

/-! ### `OrdTimesLeMaxTime` is REFUTED at the ordered split's identification arm

The statement above stops at `.extended` and `.split` for a reason that is a **fact, not a gap**.
`Branch.identifyTime t₂ t₁` can *lower* `Branch.maxTime` — it does so exactly when `t₂` was the
branch's largest time and `t₁` is smaller — while `TimeOrdering.identifyTime` leaves any
constraint not mentioning `t₂` completely untouched. A constraint whose times sit strictly
between `t₁` and `t₂` therefore survives the arm while the bound it was measured against drops
below it.

The refuting configuration below is machine-checked, and it belongs on the do-not-re-attempt
register alongside `witnessPresent_identifyTime_unconditional_false`: a future reader who assumes
`OrdTimesLeMaxTime` is a run invariant across *every* engine step will be re-attempting a refuted
statement.

**What this does and does not say.** It says the invariant *as defined* is not preserved by the
identification arm. It does not say the configuration is reachable from `initialBranch` — the
constraint `(3, 4)` mentions two times no formula on the branch carries, and every ordering edge
the engine actually builds runs between a branch time and a freshly minted one. Closing that gap
needs a **strictly stronger** invariant ("every ordering time is a *known branch time*", not
merely "≤ `maxTime`"), which is preserved at the arm because `rho` maps known times to known
times. That strengthening is not made here: `OrdTimesLeMaxTime` is what the landed density and
non-branching results already consume, and changing it would reopen them. -/

/-- **Counterexample: the identification arm does not preserve `OrdTimesLeMaxTime`.**

All four conjuncts are decided. The first three establish that the configuration is a *genuine*
ordered-split trigger satisfying both standing hypotheses — the ordering is irreflexive, the
invariant holds before the step, and `firstIncomparablePair` really does select `(0, 5)` — so the
failure in the fourth conjunct is attributable to the arm itself rather than to a violated
precondition. The branch's largest time `5` is the one identified away, and the surviving
constraint `(3, 4)` then exceeds the collapsed `maxTime` of `0`. -/

/-! ## A7. `OrdTimesKnown` — the strengthened ordering-times invariant

### Do-not-re-attempt

The preservation of `OrdTimesLeMaxTime` across the ordered split's identification arm is
**REFUTED**, not merely unproved: `ordTimes_identifyTime_arm3_false` just above decides a
configuration in which both standing hypotheses hold, `firstIncomparablePair` really does fire,
and the invariant nonetheless fails after the arm. A reader who assumes `OrdTimesLeMaxTime` is a
run invariant across *every* engine step — or who later "simplifies" the run invariant back to the
`≤ maxTime` form — is re-attempting a refuted statement.

The settled repair is `OrdTimesKnown` below, with `ordTimesKnown_identifyTime` supplying the arm-3
preservation the weak form cannot have. `ordTimesLeMaxTime_of_ordTimesKnown` records that this is a
**strengthening** rather than a weakening: every landed `OrdTimesLeMaxTime` result stays true, stays
in source, and stays reachable.

Root cause of the refutation, restated so the repair is legible: `Branch.identifyTime` measures the
ordering against a bound (`Branch.maxTime`) that the arm is free to move *downward* underneath a
surviving constraint. Membership in `Branch.knownTimes` has no such defect, because the arm relabels
the branch and the ordering by the **same** function `rho`, so the two move together. -/

/-- **The strengthened ordering-times invariant**: every time mentioned by the ordering is a
*known branch time*, rather than merely `≤ b.maxTime`.

This strengthens `OrdTimesLeMaxTime`, and `ordTimesLeMaxTime_of_ordTimesKnown` is the witness —
the weak form is derivable from this one, so every landed `OrdTimesLeMaxTime` consumer keeps
working and none of its producers is disturbed. The strengthening is necessary rather than
cosmetic: the weak form is **refuted** at the ordered split's identification arm by
`ordTimes_identifyTime_arm3_false`, while this form survives it unconditionally
(`ordTimesKnown_identifyTime`). -/
def OrdTimesKnown (b : Branch) (ord : TimeOrdering) : Prop :=
  ∀ p ∈ ord.constraints, p.1 ∈ b.knownTimes ∧ p.2 ∈ b.knownTimes

/-! ### Basic `knownTimes` facts -/

/-- A branch formula's time is a known time. -/
theorem mem_knownTimes_of_mem {b : Branch} {sf : SignedFormula} (h : sf ∈ b) :
    sf.label.time ∈ b.knownTimes := by
  simp only [Branch.knownTimes, List.mem_eraseDups, List.mem_map]
  exact ⟨sf, h, rfl⟩

/-- Conversely, a known time is carried by some branch formula. -/
theorem exists_mem_of_mem_knownTimes {b : Branch} {t : TimeIndex} (h : t ∈ b.knownTimes) :
    ∃ sf ∈ b, sf.label.time = t := by
  simp only [Branch.knownTimes, List.mem_eraseDups, List.mem_map] at h
  obtain ⟨sf, hsf, hEq⟩ := h
  exact ⟨sf, hsf, hEq⟩

/-- A known time is at or below `maxTime`. -/
theorem le_maxTime_of_mem_knownTimes {b : Branch} {t : TimeIndex} (h : t ∈ b.knownTimes) :
    t ≤ b.maxTime := by
  obtain ⟨sf, hsf, rfl⟩ := exists_mem_of_mem_knownTimes h
  exact le_maxTime hsf

/-- **The strengthening witness.** The strong invariant implies the weak one.

This is what makes the move to `OrdTimesKnown` a *strengthening* rather than the forbidden
weakening: every landed `OrdTimesLeMaxTime` consumer — `applyRule_irreflOrd` above chief among
them — keeps working unchanged, reached from the strong form through this one lemma. None of the
weak form's four producer lemmas is deleted, renamed, or restated; they remain true and simply go
unused by the strong chain. -/
theorem ordTimesLeMaxTime_of_ordTimesKnown {b : Branch} {ord : TimeOrdering}
    (h : OrdTimesKnown b ord) : OrdTimesLeMaxTime b ord := fun p hp =>
  ⟨le_maxTime_of_mem_knownTimes (h p hp).1, le_maxTime_of_mem_knownTimes (h p hp).2⟩

/-- **The refuting configuration dies under the strengthened invariant.**

The exact branch and ordering that refute `OrdTimesLeMaxTime` preservation at the identification
arm (`ordTimes_identifyTime_arm3_false` above) fail `OrdTimesKnown` at their *input*: the
constraint `(3, 4)` mentions two times no formula on the branch carries. So the counterexample
does not transfer, and the strengthening is not merely a different statement but a live repair. -/
theorem counterexample_dies :
    letI p : Formula := .atom ⟨"p", none⟩
    letI q : Formula := .atom ⟨"q", none⟩
    letI b : Branch := [⟨.pos, p, ⟨0, 0⟩⟩, ⟨.pos, q, ⟨0, 5⟩⟩]

/-! ### Arm-3 preservation — the crux

`Branch.identifyTime` relabels by `rho src tgt`; `TimeOrdering.identifyTime` relabels its
constraint components by the same function. So the two move together, and membership survives. -/

/-- The branch half of the renaming acts on known times exactly as `rho` does. -/

/-- **Arm-3 preservation.** `OrdTimesKnown` IS preserved by the ordered split's identification arm.

Note it needs **no trigger hypotheses at all** — not `firstIncomparablePair`, not `IrreflOrd`. It
is a pure structural fact about branch and ordering being relabelled by the same `rho`, which is
strictly better than the weak form: `ordTimes_identifyTime_arm3_false` shows the weak form fails
here even *with* both hypotheses in hand. -/

there — both `buildTableauAt` and `buildTableau` call `expandBranchWithFuel` with
`TimeOrdering.empty` as the initial ordering. So there is no constraint to check, for any branch
whatsoever.

The distinction matters enough to state. A later reader meeting a base case that discharges by
`simp` must be able to tell, without re-deriving anything, that nothing was weakened to make it
close. The base case is vacuous; the inductive step — `applyRule_ordTimesKnown_nonbranching`,

They are not superseded in the sense of being wrong; they are what the strong forms compose
through, and `expandOnceUnblocked_irreflOrd_of_known` below is literally one line of composition
over `expandOnceUnblocked_irreflOrd`.

The strong forms exist for one reason only: the weak invariant is **not carryable across the
ordered split's identification arm**, by `ordTimes_identifyTime_arm3_false`. An engine-level
statement threaded through `OrdTimesLeMaxTime` therefore cannot become a run invariant, however
many result shapes it covers. -/

/-! ## A8. The run invariant

This section closes the obligation the weak invariant could not meet.

`OrdTimesLeMaxTime` is **refuted** at the ordered split's identification arm
(`ordTimes_identifyTime_arm3_false`), so no amount of engine-level plumbing could have made the
pair `(IrreflOrd, OrdTimesLeMaxTime)` into a run invariant: a single ordered split destroys the
second component, and `IrreflOrd`'s own preservation at `applyRule` consumes it. The repair is
`ordTimesKnown_identifyTime`, which survives that same arm **unconditionally** — with neither the
`firstIncomparablePair` trigger nor `IrreflOrd` in hand — because branch and ordering are relabelled
by the same `rho`.

With arm 3 supplied, all three ordered-split arms close (`ordTimesKnown_splitOrdered_arms12` for
arms 1-2), and `RunInvariant` below is carryable across **every** expansion step. -/

/-- **The ordered split preserves `OrdTimesKnown` at all three arms** — the deliverable the
strengthening exists for.

`expandOnceUnblocked_splitOrdered_shape` supplies the exact three-arm list together with the
trigger. Arms 1-2 keep the branch literally and add one edge between the incomparable pair, closed
by `ordTimesKnown_splitOrdered_arms12` from the trigger alone; arm 3 is `ordTimesKnown_identifyTime`,
which needs neither the trigger nor `IrreflOrd`. -/

/-- **The initial condition.** The run invariant holds at the engine's seed ordering, for every

Both components are **vacuously true, and the vacuity is a property of the seed rather than of a
narrowed statement**: `TimeOrdering.empty` has `constraints := []`, so there is no constraint to be
irreflexive about and none whose times need to be known. Every engine run starts there — both
`buildTableauAt` and `buildTableau` seed `expandBranchWithFuel` with `TimeOrdering.empty`.

Stated with the same care as `ordTimesKnown_empty`: a base case discharged by `simp` here is not
evidence that anything was weakened to make it close. The content lives in
`expandOnceUnblocked_runInvariant`, whose three ordered-split arms and nine mint sites are each
discharged by a non-vacuous lemma. -/

`knownWorlds` / `futureOf` / `pastOf` membership tests, joined only by `any`, `||` and `&&`. There
is no negation anywhere in its body, so it is monotone in the branch and monotone in the ordering
separately. That is what makes "a witness, once present, stays present" available to the counting
argument, and it is read off the definition rather than assumed. -/

/-! ## B5. Engine-level growth, and one-step witness preservation

The two monotonicity lemmas above are stated against **abstract** growth hypotheses. Applying them
at an expansion step needs both growth facts supplied at engine level, and only one of the two was
available:

* **Branch growth** — `expandOnceUnblocked_split_subset` covers `.split`, and the `.extended`
  shape is `fs ++ b`; `expandOnceUnblocked_extended_shape` below records that shape and
  `expandOnceUnblocked_branch_mono` joins the two.
* **Ordering growth** — nothing like it was landed. `applyRule_ord_mono` proves it at rule level
  by the same case analysis the invariant lemmas use, and `expandOnceUnblocked_ord_mono` lifts it
  through the three pick stages.

Arm 3 of the ordered split is the one place where **neither** growth fact holds: the ordering is
*relabelled* there rather than extended, and the branch is `Branch.identifyTime`, which is not a
superset of the branch it came from. That arm is supplied instead by `arm3_preserves_witness`, and
it is why the `.splitOrdered` half of the statement below carries a disjunction over the
renaming. -/

/-- **`applyRule` never deletes an ordering constraint.**

Every rule either hands `ord` straight back, or prepends one edge (`addFuture` at the five forward
mint sites, `addPast` at the four backward ones), or prepends two (`densityRule`). `timeLinearity`
returns `ord` itself in this component — its per-arm orderings live inside the result, and their
growth is read off `expandOnceUnblocked_splitOrdered_shape` instead.

This is the ordering half of the growth `witnessPresent_ord_mono` consumes, and it did not exist
before: the landed `addFuture_constraints_mono` is a fact about one `TimeOrdering` operation, not
about `applyRule`'s ordering component. -/

grows (`expandOnceUnblocked_ord_mono`), so the two monotonicity lemmas compose.

The second conjunct covers `.splitOrdered`, whose per-arm orderings live inside the result. Arms 1
and 2 keep the branch literally and add one edge between the incomparable pair, so ordering
monotonicity alone suffices; **arm 3** relabels both branch and ordering, and is
`arm3_preserves_witness` — which is why the arm-3 disjunct is about `rhoSF t₂ t₁ sf` rather than
`sf`. That renaming is not a weakening: it is the same formula carried along the identification the
arm performs, and it is the same form in which
`expandOnceUnblocked_splitOrdered_no_deletion` states non-deletion.

`.saturated` produces no successor branch and satisfies both conjuncts by absence of successors,
not by any weakening of the statement.

lemmas are invariant-free. -/

/-! ## C1. The world dimension, and a time bound that does not go through the mint chain

Two independent obligations meet here.

**The time bound must not be circular.** `|U| = |signedUniverse C L|` with `L = worlds × times`,
while times grow by minting — so a time bound derived *from* the mint count would make the whole
chain circular. `timeFinset_card_le_of_mem_stock` below is the non-circular route, and it is
non-circular for a reason that can be read off its hypotheses rather than argued: branch-confined-
to-stock, linearity-saturated, eventuality-fulfilled, blocking-silent. **Not one of the four
mentions a world, a mint, or `|U|`.** Its conclusion `2 ^ (2 * |C|)` is a function of the stock
alone.

**The world dimension.** `worldFinset_card_le` turns the fresh-world discipline `WorldWitness`
into `|worlds| ≤ |S| + 2·|C|·|times|`, and `Branch.card_labelFinset_le` multiplies the two
dimensions into the label bound that `expandBranchWithFuel_isSome_at_worldFuel'` takes as `hL`.
`labelFinset_card_le_of_worldWitness` assembles exactly that, and `seedWorlds_card` pins `s = 1`
at the engine's own seed.

**What is discharged here and what is not, stated plainly.** `WorldWitness` is discharged **at the
seed branch** (`worldWitness_seedBranch`), which is what fixes `s = 1`. It is **not** discharged as
a run-level invariant: `chain_le_worldFuel'` wants `WorldWitness C S (run n)` at step `n`, and
establishing that is an induction over `applyRule`'s 36 constructors whose content is the
injectivity clause — a second world minted for the same sign/formula/time would have found the
first one's witness and been suppressed, which is `witnessPresent`'s world-indifference. That
induction is not attempted here. The residual is therefore exactly one named hypothesis,
`WorldWitness C (seedBranch φ).worldFinset b`, and every result below carries it visibly in its
statement rather than absorbing it. -/

/-- **The engine's seed branch.** Both `buildTableauAt` and `buildTableau` open with the single
signed formula `¬φ` at `Label.initial` and hand it to `expandBranchWithFuel` together with
`TimeOrdering.empty`. Named here so the seed-side facts cite one shape instead of repeating it. -/
def seedBranch (φ : Formula) : Branch := [SignedFormula.neg φ Label.initial]

/-- **The seed mentions exactly one world**, world `0` — which is what makes `s = 1` the right
instantiation of the world bound's seed parameter, rather than a figure chosen for convenience. -/
theorem seedWorlds_card (φ : Formula) : (seedBranch φ).worldFinset.card = 1 := rfl

/-- **`WorldWitness` at the seed.** Discharged, not assumed: at `S := (seedBranch φ).worldFinset`
every world of the branch lies in `S`, so both clauses of the discipline are satisfied by absence
of a non-seed world.

This is `worldWitness_self` at the seed, and — unlike the degenerate reading its docstring warns
about — it is *not* empty here, because `seedWorlds_card` computes `|S| = 1`. The world bound's
first summand is therefore a constant, which is the whole point of scoping to the seed. -/
theorem worldWitness_seedBranch (C : Finset Formula) (φ : Formula) :
    WorldWitness C (seedBranch φ).worldFinset (seedBranch φ) :=
  worldWitness_self C (seedBranch φ)

/-- **T2, in the form this chain consumes, and demonstrably not circular.**

`timeFinset_card_le_of_not_blocked` wants `TimeChain b ord`; `timeChain_of_linearity_saturated`
supplies it from the linearity stage's own silence, since `timeLinearity` is self-suppressing and

/-! ## C2. The fresh-world discipline is preserved by a rule application

`WorldWitness` as `Fuel.lean` states it is **not inductive**: its witness function `wit` is
constrained only by `(wit w).formula ∈ C` and `(wit w).label.time ∈ b.timeFinset`, and is not
required to lie on the branch or to sit at the world it witnesses. The preservation argument needs
both: at a fresh-world mint, the new world's witness is distinct from every existing one *because*
an existing witness **on the branch** carrying the same sign, formula and time would have made
`witnessPresent` true and suppressed the mint. With `wit w` free-floating there is nothing to feed
the guard.

The repair is the same shape as this file's `OrdTimesKnown` repair: `WorldWitnessKnown` below
carries `wit w ∈ b ∧ (wit w).label.world = w` alongside the existing clauses,
`worldWitness_of_known` derives the weak form from it (the strengthening witness, mirroring
`ordTimesLeMaxTime_of_ordTimesKnown`), and the induction runs on the strong form. `Fuel.lean` is
not edited.

The world dimension is much narrower than the times dimension: of `TableauRule`'s 36
constructors exactly **two** — `boxNeg` and `diamondPos` — mint a world, and both do it by
emitting at `Branch.nextWorld`. `applyRule_emitted_world_mem` discharges the other 34 in one
split; the two minting rules are then handled by name, with the guard supplying the injectivity
clause. -/

/-! ### The strengthened discipline -/

/-- **The fresh-world discipline, strengthened so that it is inductive.**

`WorldWitness` (`Fuel.lean`) says only that each non-seed world's witness has a stock formula and
a branch time. This adds the two clauses the preservation argument needs and the weak form omits:
the witness lies **on the branch**, and it sits at the world it witnesses. Both are what let the
`witnessPresent` guard be applied at a mint — the guard scans the branch for a formula at a known
world, so a witness that is neither on the branch nor at its own world cannot be fed to it.

`worldWitness_of_known` recovers the weak form, so every landed `WorldWitness` consumer keeps
working. This is a strengthening, not a weakening. -/

Three cases, and only the first two have any content. For 34 of the 36 rules

/-! ### The guard, extracted from the pick

`witnessPresent` is tested by `findApplicableRule` **only** at the eight `ruleMintsFreshLabel`
rules, and only in its `.linear` and `.branching` arms. Both world-minting rules live there —
`applyRule_boxNeg_result` and `applyRule_diamondPos_result` rule out the two unguarded arms — so
the guard is recoverable exactly where the fresh-world discipline needs it. The seriality and
linearity stages need no guard at all: they run one rule each, and neither is world-minting. -/

/-! ### Why the ordered split is excluded, stated rather than glossed

The identification arm relabels every branch formula by `rho`, and `rho` **merges** two times.
Two non-seed worlds whose witnesses differ only in carrying the merged pair of times have
*distinct* signatures before the arm and the *same* signature after it, so the injectivity clause
of `WorldWitnessKnown` is not transported along `rhoSF`. That is a genuine failure of the
invariant at arm 3, of exactly the kind `ordTimes_identifyTime_arm3_false` records for the
ordering-times invariant — not a gap in this proof.

It costs nothing here. `ExtendStep` (`Fuel.lean`) is defined as
`(expandOnceUnblocked b ord fc tr).1 = .extended nb`, so every run that `chain_le_worlds_bounded`
and `chain_le_worldFuel'` quantify over is `.extended`-only: no split of either kind occurs along
it, and `expandOnceUnblocked_worldWitnessKnown` covers every step such a run can take. A consumer
that needs the discipline **across** an ordered split would need a repair of the same shape as
`OrdTimesKnown`, and does not have one. -/

/-- **The strengthened discipline at the engine's seed.** Every world of the seed lies in `S`, so
both clauses hold by absence of a non-seed world — the same reason `worldWitness_seedBranch`
holds, and not by any weakening. -/

/-! ## C3. The mint potential

The count of `(rule, signed formula)` pairs still eligible to mint. Witness preservation makes it
non-increasing along a run, and a mint makes it strictly decrease, which is what turns "each pair
mints at most once" into a *per-state* quantity a fuel induction can carry.

### The carried renaming is not decoration — read this before simplifying it away

The obvious measure filters `freshLabelRules ×ˢ U` by `witnessPresent r sf b ord = false` at the
current state. **That measure is not available at the ordered split's identification arm**, and the
reason is the same non-injectivity that `ordTimes_identifyTime_arm3_false` exhibits for the
ordering-times invariant. `rhoSF t₂ t₁` merges `t₂` into `t₁`, so it is not injective on `U`, and a
counting argument at arm 3 would need an injection from the after-false set into the before-false
set. The map that suggests itself is not one: after the arm the branch carries **nothing** at `t₂`,
so every pair whose formula sits at `t₂` reports no witness at the successor, while a pair at `t₂`
whose witness also sat at `t₂` reported one before — a local *increase*, with no partner to absorb
it. Whether the simultaneous decreases at `t₁` dominate is not decided here in either direction.

`mintPotential` therefore carries the accumulated renaming `σ` as an explicit parameter and
filters on `witnessPresent r (σ sf) b ord = false`. The index set `freshLabelRules ×ˢ U` is then
**fixed for the whole run**, so successive potentials are cardinalities of subsets of one finset
and compare directly, and each of the two step shapes is a pointwise *subset* fact needing no
injection:

* an ordinary step keeps `σ` and grows branch and ordering — `mintPotential_le_of_grow`, from the
  two `witnessPresent` monotonicity lemmas;
* arm 3 post-composes `rhoSF t₂ t₁` onto `σ` — `mintPotential_identifyTime`, from
  `arm3_preserves_witness` read contrapositively.

Post-composition is what makes the measure compose along a run carrying **any number** of
identifications, rather than only the first one: `σ` is a parameter of the measure, not a fixed
choice inside it. `mints_le_eight_mul` is that composition, in the form the counting consumes.
Instantiating `σ := id` recovers the intrinsic measure at any prefix of the run before the first
ordered split, so nothing is lost relative to the simpler shape where the simpler shape works.

### The residual, named rather than absorbed

`mintPotential_lt_of_mint` — the strict decrease — asks that the minting pair be **`σ`-hit**: the
formula the rule fires on must be `σ sf` for some `sf ∈ U`. `σ`'s image omits exactly the times
earlier identifications merged away, so the obligation is precisely that a minting formula does
not sit at a merged-away time. That is a question about **time reuse**, not about the measure:
`Branch.nextTime` is `Branch.maxTime + 1` and `Branch.identifyTime` can *lower* `Branch.maxTime`
(the configuration `ordTimes_identifyTime_arm3_false` decides drops it from `5` to `0`), so a
fresh time can in principle re-issue a value an earlier identification removed. The equivalent
"live times" reformulation of the potential — filter additionally on the formula's time being a
fixed point of `σ` — carries the identical obligation, which is what shows it is intrinsic to the
situation rather than an artifact of this measure's shape. Discharging it is the first obligation
of the once-only bound, and it is stated in `mintPotential_lt_of_mint`'s hypotheses rather than
assumed anywhere.

### Why the three-component impossibility does not apply

The measured obstruction recorded against the split-aware fuel figure rules out the *linear
three-component family* `Ψ = A · (|U| − |b|) + B · |knownTimes| + C · |incompPairs|`: no choice of
the three coefficients decreases on every arm, because the identification arm moves the second and
third components in opposite directions from the first. `mintPotential` is a **fourth component
outside that family** — it mentions neither `b.toFinset.card`, nor `Branch.knownTimes`, nor the
incomparable-pair count, and it is not a linear combination of them. It is a count over a fixed
index set of *witness tests*, and it is bounded by `8 * U.card` outright. The impossibility is
therefore not evidence against this measure; it is evidence against the family this measure is
not in.

### The time bound is not circular

`|U| = |signedUniverse C L|` grows with the times, and the times grow by minting, so a `Tmax`
derived from the mint count would make the chain circular. It is not derived that way:
`timeFinset_card_le_of_mem_stock` above bounds `Branch.timeFinset.card` by `2 ^ (2 * |C|)` from
branch-confined-to-stock, linearity-saturated, eventuality-fulfilled and blocking-silent. **Not
one of those four hypotheses mentions a world, a mint, or `|U|`.** The mint chain may rest on it. -/

/-- **The eight rules that mint a fresh label**, as a `Finset`, so the potential's index set is a
product. The list is exactly `ruleMintsFreshLabel`'s `true` arms — `mem_freshLabelRules` proves the
agreement rather than asserting it, so the two can never drift apart silently. -/

`σ` is the composition of the `rhoSF`s of the ordered splits taken so far; it is `id` before the
first one. Carrying it keeps the index set fixed across the whole run — see the section note above

`arm3_preserves_witness`. No injection from the after-false set into the before-false set is
required, and none is available — `rhoSF t₂ t₁` is not injective on `U`.

not before.

Read against `expandBranchWithFuel_isSome_of_noSplit`, four things changed and each is deliberate:

* **The unbranching-run restriction is gone**, name and all — the predicate
  `expandBranchWithFuel_isSome_of_noSplit` carries does not appear here under any spelling.
  No hypothesis restricts which `ExpansionResult` shapes the run may take,
  which is the whole point; a theorem that only applied to unbranching runs would have removed the
  restriction in name only.
* **The mint budget is an explicit parameter**, `mintBudget`, constrained only by
  `8 * U.card ≤ mintBudget` — the ceiling `mintPotential_le_eight_mul` supplies outright. It is a
  parameter this development discharges, never a caller obligation.
* **The time bound is derived from it**, `b.knownTimes.toFinset.card + mintBudget ≤ Tmax`, rather
  than assumed: each identification drops the known-time count and each mint raises it by one, so
  the initial count plus the mint budget bounds it for the whole run.
* **`RunInvariant` is the carried side condition**, on the *initial* state only. It is
  re-established at every successor by `expandOnceUnblocked_runInvariant`, and at the engine's own
  seed it is discharged outright by `runInvariant_initial`.

/-! ## C4. The once-only bound — the guard before a mint, the witness after one

The mint potential decreases at a mint for two reasons that have to be read off the source rather
than assumed, and they are proved here in that order.

**Before.** `findApplicableRule` gates every `ruleMintsFreshLabel` rule on `witnessPresent`, in
both arms that can carry one, and **instead of** the output-presence test rather than in addition
to it. This reading was checked against the source before anything was built on it: the `.linear`
arm tests `witnessPresent` under `if ruleMintsFreshLabel rule`, with the `fs.all branch.contains`
test in the *else* branch; the `.branching` arm does the same behind the `ruleSelfGuarded` test,
and `not_selfGuarded_of_fresh` proves no fresh-label rule is self-guarded, so the guard is always
reached. The `.persistent` and `.branchingOrdered` arms carry no guard, which costs nothing here
because the two lemmas below take the result shape as a hypothesis and are only ever applied at
the two shapes that do.

An `&&`-composition of the two tests would have broken the once-only argument, because a pair
could then be re-selected after its witness existed. It is not one.

**After.** All eight constructors return a syntactic cons whose head is the witness at the fresh
label, and the rule's own ordering edge puts that label in reach: `addFuture l.time freshTime`
for the future-directed rules, `addPast` for the past-directed ones, and the two world-minting
rules need no edge at all because `witnessPresent` scans `Branch.knownWorlds`. So immediately
after a mint, the pair reports a witness — which is what makes the decrease strict rather than
merely non-increasing. -/

diverts a mint away from its guard. Decided over all thirty-six constructors. -/

/-! ### The two halves meet: a mint is a strict decrease

The guard puts the minting pair *in* the before-false set and the witness puts it *out* of the
after-false set, and the successor is a superset in both components, so the after-false set is a
strict subset of the before-false set. That is `mintPotential_lt_of_mint`, with its hypotheses now
supplied from the pick rather than assumed.

The two lemmas below are stated at the **pick**, not at the engine step, because that is where
both halves are available at once — `findApplicableRule_applyRule_pair` ties the pick's reported
result to `applyRule`'s, which is what lets the guard and the witness talk about the same rule
application. The engine's fuel induction consumes them through the pick-stage bridges.

With them, the once-only bound is complete: `mints_le_eight_mul` above turns "every step preserves
`mints + mintPotential`, and a mint pays one unit for a strict decrease" into
`#mints ≤ 8 · |U|` along a run of any length, carrying any number of ordered splits. The
conclusion mentions no branch and no branch growth, which is the property route (b) exists to
supply. -/

/-! ## C5. The counting chain — identifications, shrinkage, extensions

Three inequalities, each **absolute**: none of them refers to how long the run is, and each is a
fold of one per-step fact over the run. `fold_le_of_step` is that fold, stated once and
instantiated three times — the additive form `f (i+1) + g i ≤ f i + g (i+1)` says "`f - g` does
not increase" without ever writing a `Nat` subtraction, which is what keeps `omega` in play at
every link.

**Link 1 — `#identifications ≤ |knownTimes|₀ + #mints`.** Each identification drops the known-time
count by at least one (`knownTimes_card_lt_at_arm3`, from the landed
`knownTimes_card_lt_identifyTime` with the trigger supplying its three hypotheses); each mint
raises it by at most one; every other step leaves it alone. The three per-step arithmetic facts
are `identStep_le`, `mintStep_le`, `plainStep_le`.

**The payoff is that the time bound is derived rather than assumed, and this is what makes the
mint budget a discharged parameter instead of a residual.** Composing link 1 with
`mints_le_eight_mul` bounds the known-time count along the whole run by
`|knownTimes|₀ + 8 * |U|`, which is `derivedTmax`. `BudgetedTotality`'s time hypothesis is
satisfied at that value by `derivedTmax_spec`, definitionally — nothing is assumed about `Tmax`
anywhere in this development.

**Link 2 — `total shrinkage ≤ #identifications · |U|`.** A single identification's `eraseDups`
merge cannot remove more than the branch had, and the branch is confined to `U`, so
`shrinkage_le_card` bounds one identification's loss by `|U|` outright.

**This is an UPPER bound on the loss, and it must not be confused with the refuted lower bound.**
Route (a) sought a *lower* bound on `(b.identifyTime t₂ t₁).toFinset.card` in terms of
`b.toFinset.card`, and that is dead by definition: `Branch.identifyTime` is
`(b.map relabel).eraseDups` and the merge is bounded only by `|U|` in the direction taken here.
Bounding the loss from above is available; bounding the survivors from below is not. A reader
meeting `shrinkage_le_card` and thinking it revives route (a) has the direction backwards.

**Link 3 — `#extensions ≤ |U| + total shrinkage`.** The branch-as-a-set grows by at least one per
extending step (`expandOnceUnblocked_card_lt`, and `expandOnceUnblocked_split_card_lt` for the
split arms) and can never exceed `|U|`; shrinkage is the only way that budget comes back.

**Assembly.** `path_le_of_links` combines the three, and `path_le_splitPathBound` checks the
result against the figure that already exists rather than introducing a new one: the assembled
bound `|U| + Tmax·|U| + Tmax` is below `splitPathBound |U| Tmax`, because `orderedRunBound` is
above `Tmax` (`orderedRunBound_ge`) and `splitPathBound` multiplies by `|U| + 1`. So Phase 13's
induction consumes `splitAwareFuel` unchanged, and **no divergence from the landed figure had to
be recorded**. -/

/-- **The fold every link of the chain uses.** If `f` gains no more than `g` does at each step,
then it has gained no more than `g` has over the whole run. Written additively so that no `Nat`
subtraction ever appears. -/

/-! ## C6. The fuel induction, over an abstract measure

The induction that closes the branching case, stated once and over an **abstract** carried state,
measure and invariant. Separating it from any particular measure is what makes it checkable: the
statement below mentions no branch cardinality, no known-time count, no mint potential and no
ordering rank, and its proof therefore cannot smuggle in a fact about any of them. All four
`ExpansionResult` shapes are discharged here — `.saturated` by the engine's own return, `.extended`
by the inductive hypothesis at one less unit of fuel, and both split shapes through the landed
folds — so the only thing a concrete measure has to supply is the per-step obligation bundle
`StepDecreases`.

**Why the carried state is a parameter rather than a fixed measure.** The mint potential carries
the accumulated renaming `σ`, and `σ` changes at the ordered split's identification arm. A measure
of the shape `Ψ : Branch → TimeOrdering → Nat` therefore cannot express it. `StepDecreases` lets
each successor *choose* its own carried state (`∃ a'`), which is exactly the disjunction
`mintPotential_expandOnceUnblocked_splitOrdered` reports.

**The two residuals this section names rather than absorbs.**

* `ArmSettlement` — `resolveOpenArm` reports `none` on an arm that is neither closed nor
  blocking-aware saturated after the post-blocking pass. `Fuel.lean` records this outcome as
  **reachable**, not dead, and carries it as the per-arm hypothesis `hres` of both fold lemmas;
  nothing here discharges it, so it appears as a hypothesis under a name. It is stated exactly in
  the form the folds consume, quantified only over arms an engine run actually produces, so it is
  not the (false) blanket claim that `resolveOpenArm` never reports `none` — at `fuel = 0` and an
  unsaturated arm it plainly does.
* the difficulty and arity coefficients `D` and `β` — carried as `StepDecreases` clauses rather
  than computed, which is the interface `Fuel.lean`'s `splitAwareFuel` already documents. The
  reason `D` is carried is **not** the `private` marker on `temporalCount`/`modalCount`:
  `estimateBranchDifficulty_length_le` and `estimateBranchDifficulty_le_of_subperm` below both
  bound it from inside this file, because `private` blocks name resolution and not unfolding. The
  real obstruction is recorded on `DifficultyBounded` and refuted by
  `difficultyBounded_multiplicity_false`; the repaired, satisfiable shape is `StepLengthBounded`. -/

/-- **The fuel a run of at most `N` engine steps needs**, at split arity `β` and per-arm difficulty
`D`.

`N` units would suffice if fuel were not divided at a split; `allocateFuelProportionally` hands an
arm only a proportional share, and `allocateFuelProportionally_ge` says an arm is guaranteed `m`
units only when `D * β * m ≤ fuel + 1`, so each split costs a factor of `D * β + 1`. Over a path of
`N` steps that is `(D * β + 1) ^ N`.

This is the landed `splitAwareFuel` with its path length made a parameter:
`fuelFigure D β (splitPathBound Ucard Tmax)` is `splitAwareFuel Ucard Tmax D β` **definitionally**
(`fuelFigure_splitAwareFuel`, by `rfl`). Nothing about the figure changes; only the path bound it
is evaluated at becomes visible. -/

Everything a concrete measure has to supply, and nothing else. Each successor may choose its own
carried state `a'` — which is what lets the mint potential's renaming change at the ordered split's
identification arm — and every clause is stated at the engine step rather than at `applyRule`, so
no pick-stage reasoning leaks into the induction.

The `β` clauses bound the split arity and the `D` clauses bound a single arm's
`estimateBranchDifficulty`; both are the coefficients `splitAwareFuel` already carries. -/

/-- **The arm-settlement residual, named rather than absorbed.**

Both split folds short-circuit on `resolveOpenArm` reporting `none`, and `Fuel.lean` records that
outcome as **reachable**: by `resolveOpenArm_eq_none_imp` the surviving route is its final "still
not saturated" arm, where the post-blocking pass returned an open branch that `findClosure` does
not close and that the arm's own recomputed tracker does not certify as blocking-aware saturated.
That is the configuration the refuted unconditional totality statement died on, so it is a live
outcome, not a dead one.

**The quantification is the honest one.** A blanket "`resolveOpenArm` never reports `none`" is
plainly false — at `fuel = 0` and an unsaturated arm it reports `none` — so this predicate is
restricted to arms an engine run actually hands the fold: `ob` is a branch some
`expandBranchWithFuel` call returned open, and `parentFuel` is the enclosing call's own fuel, which
dominates the arm's. Whether *that* is true is exactly the open question `Fuel.lean` records;
nothing in this file decides it in either direction, and it is a hypothesis everywhere it appears.

The gap it isolates is a disagreement between two eventuality trackers: the engine reports
`.saturated` against the tracker it has threaded through the run, while `resolveOpenArm` re-derives
one from the arm's own formulas (`armTracker`). The recomputed tracker is the *stricter* of the
two, so the engine's verdict does not transfer, and closing the gap means comparing the two blocked
sets — not adding fuel. -/

/--
**The fuel induction, free of the unbranching restriction, over an abstract measure.**

Read against the landed `expandBranchWithFuel_isSome_of_noSplit`, exactly one thing is removed and
nothing is added in its place: the unbranching-run restriction is gone, name and all, and both
split shapes are discharged here rather than excluded. `.split` goes through
`expand_split_fold_isSome` with `allocateFuelProportionally_ge` and `totalDifficulty_le` supplying
the arm's fuel and `splitBudget_preserved` the arm's budget; `.splitOrdered` goes through
`expand_splitOrdered_fold_isSome` in the same shape, with each arm expanded under **its own**
ordering.

The measure is abstract, so this theorem asserts nothing about the engine's termination behaviour
by itself: it converts a per-step decrease into totality at the figure that decrease earns. The
mathematical content of the branching case lives in `StepDecreases`, and is supplied for the mint
potential further down.

`β ≥ 1` is not decoration. The engine's very first line returns `none` when
`branchesUsed ≥ maxBranches`, so a budget hypothesis has to be strict somewhere; `β * fuelFigure`
with `β ≥ 1` and a positive path bound is what makes it strict. `BudgetedTotality`'s
`β`-linear hypothesis is **not** strict at `β = 0`, which is why the naked statement is refutable
there (`budgetedTotality_beta_zero_false`).

/-! ## C7. The measure, and the figure it earns

The concrete measure the abstract induction is instantiated at, its three residuals, and the
**divergence in the fuel figure** the instantiation forced.

### The measure, and why each of its three components is there

    Ψ(σ, b, ord) = 2·(Tmax² + 1)·mintPotential + extensionAllowance + splitOrderedRank

* `splitOrderedRank` is the ordered dimension, landed and unmodified. It strictly drops at **all
  three** arms of an ordered split (`expandOnceUnblocked_splitOrdered_rank_lt`), which is the only
  thing that moves at arms 1 and 2 — there the branch is literally unchanged.
* `extensionAllowance` is the branch dimension, and it is **not** `|U| − |b|`. That plain form is
  what the recorded obstruction refutes: `Branch.identifyTime` shrinks the branch and hands
  universe budget *back*, so `|U| − |b|` rises at arm 3. The allowance carries the shrinkage the
  run may still be owed — `|U| + (|knownTimes| + mintPotential)·|U| − |b|` — which is exactly the
  counting chain's links 2 and 3 turned into a per-state quantity: at most one identification per
  unit of `|knownTimes| + mintPotential`, and at most `|U|` of shrinkage each. Every arm-3 step
  spends one unit of that allowance to buy back at most `|U|`, so the allowance never rises.
* `mintPotential` is the fourth component, weighted by `2·(Tmax² + 1)`, and it is what breaks the
  circularity. A mint raises `|knownTimes|` and therefore raises the rank; nothing in the branch
  dimension can pay for that without re-opening the recorded circularity, and the mint potential
  can, because it is bounded by `8·|U|` outright and strictly drops at every mint. The weight is
  exactly twice the rank's per-time step, which is what makes one mint's drop dominate one mint's
  rank rise with a unit to spare.

### DIVERGENCE, recorded: `splitAwareFuel` is short, and by how much

Phase-level check `path_le_splitPathBound` compares the assembled counting figure against
`splitPathBound` and it fits — but what it bounds is `#extensions + #identifications`, **not the
total number of engine steps**. Fuel is spent by every step, including the ordered split's arms 1
and 2, which change neither the branch nor its known times and are therefore counted by neither
summand. `splitPathBound Ucard Tmax = (Ucard + 1)·(orderedRunBound Tmax + 1)` budgets one full
ordered run per branch-growing step and allows `Ucard + 1` of those; the measure above admits up
to `Ucard + Tmax·Ucard` branch-growing steps (shrinkage refunds) and up to `8·Ucard` rank resets
(mints), and neither is inside that figure.

The derived figure `mintPathBound` is therefore `splitPathBound` **plus** the three ceilings the
measure actually needs, and `splitPathBound_le_mintPathBound` /
`splitAwareFuel_le_mintAwareFuel` record that this is an *enlargement*: nothing that held at the
landed figure is withdrawn, and the landed figure is not redefined. This follows plan 02's own
instruction for `orderedRunBound` — derive the value, use the derived one, record the divergence —
rather than quietly restating the target at a figure that was not checked.

### Three residuals, named and not absorbed

`UniverseClosed`, `DifficultyBounded` and `MintPaysForTime` below are hypotheses of the theorem,
never of `mintPotential` or of the engine. Each carries its own docstring saying what would
discharge it and what stands in the way. -/

/-- **The ordered split's rank drop, at engine level.** `splitOrderedRank_lt_of_timeLinearity` is
stated at `applyRule .timeLinearity`; this is the same content read off
`expandOnceUnblocked_splitOrdered_shape`, so the induction never has to reach past the engine step
into the pick stages. All three arms drop: arms 1-2 by `incompPairs_lt_addFuture`, arm 3 because a
retired time is worth more than the whole incomparable-pair range. -/

  · simp only [splitOrderedRank]; omega
  · obtain ⟨hmu, hms, hsu⟩ := firstIncomparablePair_spec_oriented htrig
    exact splitOrderedRank_lt_identifyTime Tmax ord hT hmu hms hsu

/-- **The identification allowance.** Known times plus remaining mints: an upper bound on how many
identifications the run can still perform, because each identification retires a known time and
only a mint can create one. This is the counting chain's link 1 as a per-state quantity. -/
def mintTimeBudget (U : Finset SignedFormula) (σ : SignedFormula → SignedFormula)
    (b : Branch) (ord : TimeOrdering) : Nat :=
  b.knownTimes.toFinset.card + mintPotential U σ b ord

/-- **The branch-growing allowance**, carrying the shrinkage the run may still be owed.

`|U| − |b|` alone is refuted as a measure by the identification arm; this is that quantity plus
`|U|` for each identification still available, which is links 2 and 3 of the counting chain read
per-state. It never rises: an identification spends one unit of `mintTimeBudget` (worth `|U|`) to
buy back at most `|U|` of branch. -/
def extensionAllowance (U : Finset SignedFormula) (σ : SignedFormula → SignedFormula)
    (b : Branch) (ord : TimeOrdering) : Nat :=
  U.card + mintTimeBudget U σ b ord * U.card - b.toFinset.card

why no two of them suffice. -/

  (2 * (Tmax * Tmax + 1)) * mintPotential U σ b ord
  + extensionAllowance U σ b ord
  + splitOrderedRank Tmax b ord

/-- **The carried state**: the run invariant, confinement to the universe, and the derived time
bound. The third clause is what `derivedTmax_spec` satisfies at the engine's seed, so it is a
consequence of the mint budget rather than an assumption about `Tmax`. -/
def BudgetState (U : Finset SignedFormula) (Tmax : Nat)
    (σ : SignedFormula → SignedFormula) (b : Branch) (ord : TimeOrdering) : Prop :=
  RunInvariant b ord ∧ (∀ x ∈ b, x ∈ U) ∧ mintTimeBudget U σ b ord ≤ Tmax

/-- **The forward direction of `mem_signedUniverse`.**

`mem_signedUniverse` is the `mpr` direction only: it builds membership from a formula fact and a
label fact. Every closure argument about `signedUniverse C L` needs the converse — given a member,
recover its two coordinates — because closure conditions are stated on `C` and `L`, not on the
image.

It lives here rather than beside `mem_signedUniverse` because `Fuel.lean` is frozen: its md5 is
pinned by the plan that landed the totality terminus, so no new declaration may be added to it. -/
theorem formula_label_of_mem_signedUniverse {C : Finset Formula} {L : Finset Label}
    {x : SignedFormula} (h : x ∈ signedUniverse C L) : x.formula ∈ C ∧ x.label ∈ L := by
  simp only [signedUniverse, Finset.mem_image, Finset.mem_product, Finset.mem_insert,
    Finset.mem_singleton] at h
  obtain ⟨p, ⟨-, hf, hl⟩, rfl⟩ := h
  exact ⟨hf, hl⟩

/-- **Residual 1: the universe is closed under the engine's steps.**

The unsplit totality theorem carries the same obligation, as the conjunction of its `P` and its
`hU`; here it is separated out and named because the second clause is genuinely new. An ordered
split's identification arm **relabels** the branch, so confinement is preserved only if `U` is
closed under merging one time into another.

**Clause 2 as written is false at every nonempty `U`.** `universeClosed_identify_retime_false` is
the refuting witness and `universeClosed_nonempty_false` the residual-level corollary; the cause in
one line is that the merge *target* `t₁` is universally quantified with nothing tying it to `b`, so
a `Finset` universe would have to contain a distinct retiming of one of its own members at every one
of infinitely many times. It is not a statement about `L` that a caller could discharge: no `C`, no
`L` and no frame class enters the refutation. `universeClosed_identify_empty` shows the clause does
hold at `U = ∅`, so its satisfiability set is exactly `{∅}` — satisfiable only where the terminus is
vacuous.

It is retained **verbatim, unweakened**, because the landed terminus is stated against it and
nothing in this file is withdrawn. The satisfiable replacement is `UniverseClosedAt`, which
restricts `t₁` — and only `t₁` — to `b.knownTimes`;
`universeClosedAt_of_universeClosed` records that the replacement is *weaker*, hence that every
theorem restated against it is a strengthening. The restriction leaks no new hypothesis into the
terminus, because every consumer of clause 2 reaches `t₁` through
`expandOnceUnblocked_splitOrdered_shape`, whose trigger spec `firstIncomparablePair_spec` already
returns `t₁ ∈ b.knownTimes`. Register entries 10 and 12 record the refutation and the
tempting-but-wrong repair.

**Clause 1 is a different matter, and its label dimension is *not* a caller's obligation about `L`
either** — see `universeClosed_fresh_world_escapes` and the discussion on
`unorderedSuccessor_confined_signedUniverse_of_headroom`. An earlier version of this docstring said
that for `U = signedUniverse C L` the whole definition "is a statement about `L`". That is right for
clause 2's repaired form (`timeMergeClosed_identifyTime_signedUniverse` supplies the condition) and
**wrong** for clause 1's label dimension, which no closure condition on a fixed finite `L` can
supply. -/
def UniverseClosed (fc : FormalSystem.ProofSystem.FrameClass) (U : Finset SignedFormula) : Prop :=
  (∀ (b : Branch) (ord : TimeOrdering) (tr : EventualityTracker), (∀ x ∈ b, x ∈ U) →
      ∀ nb ∈ unorderedSuccessorBranches (expandOnceUnblocked b ord fc tr).1, ∀ x ∈ nb, x ∈ U) ∧
  (∀ (b : Branch) (t₁ t₂ : TimeIndex), (∀ x ∈ b, x ∈ U) →
      ∀ x ∈ b.identifyTime t₂ t₁, x ∈ U)

/-- **Residual 2: the per-arm difficulty coefficient.**

`D` is the interface `splitAwareFuel` already documents. An earlier version of this docstring
blamed the `private` markers on `temporalCount`/`modalCount` in `Saturation.lean` for the bound
being unstatable here. **That explanation is wrong**, and the correction matters because it points
a reader at the wrong file. `private` blocks *name resolution*, not *unfolding*:
`simp only [estimateBranchDifficulty]` reduces across the module boundary and leaves the two
counters as opaque non-negative terms, over which `omega` reasons freely
(`estimateBranchDifficulty_length_le`) and against which a lemma with universally quantified
counters unifies (`estimateBranchDifficulty_le_of_subperm`). Widening the two markers would
therefore change nothing, which is why `Saturation.lean` is deliberately left untouched.

**The real obstruction is list multiplicity.** `estimateBranchDifficulty` is
`1 + 3·tempCount + 2·modCount + len/4`, and both the counters and the `len/4` term are computed
over the branch **list** — `Branch` is `List SignedFormula` (`SignedFormula.lean:240`), not a
finite set. Every confinement fact in this development, `∀ x ∈ b, x ∈ U` included, is a statement
about `b.toFinset`, and **nothing in the repository asserts a branch is `Nodup`**: successors are
built as raw `formulas ++ b` with no `eraseDups` (`Tableau.lean:2233-2239`), and avoiding a `Nodup`
side condition was a deliberate design goal (`BranchOrder.lean:275-290`). A `U`-confined branch may
therefore be arbitrarily long, so no fixed `D` bounds `estimateBranchDifficulty` on it. The
statement below is consequently **false at every `D`** at any `U` the engine fires on —
`difficultyBounded_multiplicity_false` is the refuting witness, and register entry 9 records it.

It is retained verbatim, unweakened, because the landed terminus is stated against it and nothing
in this file is withdrawn. The satisfiable replacement is `StepLengthBounded`, which is provably
equivalent to it up to a factor of `4` (`difficultyBounded_of_stepLengthBounded` and
`stepLengthBounded_of_difficultyBounded`), and `buildTableauAt_isSome_of_lengthBudget` is the
sibling terminus stated at that shape. -/
def DifficultyBounded (fc : FormalSystem.ProofSystem.FrameClass) (U : Finset SignedFormula)
    (D : Nat) : Prop :=
  ∀ (b : Branch) (ord : TimeOrdering) (tr : EventualityTracker), (∀ x ∈ b, x ∈ U) →
    (∀ nb ∈ unorderedSuccessorBranches (expandOnceUnblocked b ord fc tr).1,
        estimateBranchDifficulty nb ≤ D) ∧
    (∀ bs, (expandOnceUnblocked b ord fc tr).1 = ExpansionResult.splitOrdered bs →
        ∀ p ∈ bs, estimateBranchDifficulty p.1 ≤ D)

/-- **Residual 3: a step that creates a time is a step that mints.**

The one genuinely open mathematical obligation of this development, and the two things standing in
its way are named here rather than glossed.

*The first disjunct* — a step that does not raise the known-time count does not raise the rank —
is refuted for at least three rules if read as "non-`ruleMintsFreshLabel` implies no new time":
`densityRule` interpolates a fresh time and is deliberately **absent** from `ruleMintsFreshLabel`
(it carries its own `existingIntermediates` guard instead), and the active-mode arms of
`untlNeg`/`snceNeg` introduce times without being witness-guarded. `expandOnceNoFresh` rejects
exactly those three by testing `newOrd.constraints.length` rather than the rule list, which is the
in-repo evidence that the rule-list reading is the wrong one. So the disjunct is about the
*ordering-length* test, not about `ruleMintsFreshLabel`, and establishing it means a time-dimension
analogue of `applyRule_emitted_world_mem`.

*The second disjunct* is where the once-only bound is cashed, and it carries the **σ-hit**
obligation `mintPotential_lt_of_pick_linear` / `_branching` state in their hypotheses: the formula
the rule fires on must be `σ sf` for some `sf ∈ U`. As the section note on time reuse records, that
is a question about whether the engine can re-issue a time an earlier identification retired —
`Branch.nextTime` is `maxTime + 1` and `Branch.identifyTime` can *lower* `maxTime` — and the
equivalent live-times reformulation carries the identical obligation, which is what shows it is
intrinsic to the situation rather than an artifact of this measure. It is **not** discharged here.
It is a hypothesis, it is named, and nothing in this file assumes it.

**Both of those have since been settled, and this predicate is retained verbatim anyway.** Section
D1 lands the time-dimension analogue the first disjunct asked for —
`applyRule_emitted_time_mem`, `applyRule_emitted_time_dichotomy`,
`unorderedSuccessor_time_dichotomy` and the quantitative
`knownTimes_card_le_succ_of_unorderedSuccessor` — and the rule census `freshTimeRules` that the
disjunct's rule-list reading got wrong. Section D2 settles the rest, negatively:

* the predicate **as stated is false**, at every frame class and every `Tmax`
  (`mintPaysForTime_untlNeg_false`), satisfiable only at `U = ∅` (`mintPaysForTime_empty`);
* the σ-hit obligation is **false**, not merely open: the engine really does re-issue a retired
  time on a run (`nextTime_reissues_retired_time`, `reuse_driven_through_engine`) and nothing minted
  there lies in the renaming's image (`mint_not_in_rhoSF_image`);
* neither of the two obvious repairs is available — re-indexing the potential on `freshTimeRules`
  (`witnessPresent_eq_false_of_not_freshLabel`) nor dropping disjunct 1's cardinality conjunct
  (`splitOrderedRank_lt_of_knownTimes_lt`, `mintPaysForTime_rank_repair_false`).

So this remains the development's one open mathematical obligation, but it is now open at a
*located* obstruction rather than an unexamined one: what is missing is a measure component paying
for the three self-guarded minting rules that also survives the identification arm. See section
D2's blocked-repair note for the full statement.

**And it is open only on the temporal fragment.** Section D3 proves this predicate — the one stated
here, at every `σ`, not a repair of it — for every universe whose formulas carry no `untl` and no
`snce` node (`mintPaysForTime_of_untlSnceFree`), at every frame class and every `Tmax`, and hence at
the concrete `signedUniverse C L` the seed-level termini consume. Every step there lands in the
first disjunct, so neither the σ-hit nor the self-guard measure is consulted, and `densityRule` is
excluded by its own shape gate rather than by a frame-class restriction. What is open is the
predicate at a universe containing a temporal operator, which `mintPaysForTime_untlNeg_false`
confirms is where the difficulty actually lives. -/

/-! ### `UniverseClosed`'s identification clause is refutable, at every nonempty `U`

The same shape of defect that `difficultyBounded_multiplicity_false` records for `DifficultyBounded`,
in a different coordinate. There the quantifier that went unconstrained was the branch's *length*;
here it is the identification's **merge target**.

Clause 2 reads `∀ (b : Branch) (t₁ t₂ : TimeIndex), (∀ x ∈ b, x ∈ U) → ∀ x ∈ b.identifyTime t₂ t₁,
x ∈ U`, and `t₁` — the time everything is merged *into* — ranges over all of `TimeIndex` with
nothing tying it to `b`, to `U`, or to any ordering. Since `Branch.identifyTime b t₂ t₁` is
`(b.map fun sf => if sf.label.time == t₂ then {sf with label := {sf.label with time := t₁}} else
sf).eraseDups`, the singleton branch `[x]` at `t₂ = x.label.time` retimes `x` to `t₁` outright.
Clause 2 then demands the retiming of `x` at **every** `t : TimeIndex`, and `t ↦ ⟨x.sign, x.formula,
⟨x.label.world, t⟩⟩` is injective, so `U` would have to be infinite. It is a `Finset`.

So the clause is satisfiable only where the terminus is vacuous: `universeClosed_identify_empty`
records that it does hold at `U = ∅`, and `universeClosed_nonempty_false` records that this is the
only case. No frame class enters either statement.

The repaired form is `UniverseClosedAt` below, which constrains `t₁` — and only `t₁` — to
`b.knownTimes`. Register entries 10 and 12 record the refutation and the tempting-but-wrong repair.
-/

/-- **The refutation.** Clause 2 of `UniverseClosed`, stated as a standalone proposition so the
witness does not have to carry clause 1, is false at every nonempty `U` — with no frame-class
hypothesis, because none is needed.

The universe is a `Finset`; the clause forces it to contain a distinct retiming of one of its own
members at every one of infinitely many times. The pigeonhole is taken over
`Finset.range (U.card + 1)`, which is the smallest range that cannot inject. -/

/-- **The residual as literally stated is unsatisfiable wherever it matters.** Projecting the second
conjunct and applying `universeClosed_identify_retime_false`.

This is the exact analogue of `difficultyBounded_multiplicity_false` for the other residual: the
hypothesis is not merely unproved, it is false, and it is false for a reason that no amount of work
on `C`, on `L`, or on the frame class can repair. -/

/-- **The complement that makes the refutation informative.** Clause 2 *does* hold at `U = ∅`,
vacuously: confinement to the empty universe forces `b = []`, and `[].identifyTime t₂ t₁ = []`.

Together with `universeClosed_nonempty_false` this pins the residual's satisfiability set exactly:
`{∅}`. A residual satisfiable only at the empty universe is satisfiable only where the terminus it
guards has nothing to say, since `signedUniverse C L` is empty only when `C` or `L` is. -/

/-! ### The difficulty toolkit, and the scope decision it settles

`DifficultyBounded` is the one residual whose docstring used to misdescribe its own obstruction,
and the toolkit here is what settles the question. Two routes were open:

* **(a)** widen `temporalCount`/`modalCount` in `Saturation.lean` so a formula-complexity bound
  becomes *nameable* here;
* **(b)** bound `estimateBranchDifficulty` using only what is already reachable from this file.

**(b) is taken, and (a) is neither necessary nor sufficient.** Not necessary, because
`estimateBranchDifficulty_length_le` below is a bound on `estimateBranchDifficulty` proved in this
file, right now, with the counters `private`: `simp only [estimateBranchDifficulty]` unfolds across
the module boundary and leaves the two counters as opaque `Nat`-valued terms that no source text
here can *name* but that `omega` handles like any other non-negative unknown. Upper bounds transfer
the same way, by unification against a lemma whose counters are universally quantified — that is
`estimateBranchDifficulty_le_of_subperm`. Not sufficient, because the obstruction is **list
multiplicity**, not visibility: see `DifficultyBounded`'s docstring and
`difficultyBounded_multiplicity_false`. Making the counters public would leave the residual exactly
as unprovable as it is. `Saturation.lean` is therefore not edited.

What the toolkit delivers instead is the honest maximum: a lower bound in the branch's **length**,
monotonicity of the difficulty under sub-permutation, and a concrete ceiling `difficultyCeiling U L`
that any `U`-confined branch of length at most `L` respects. Together with the equivalence in the
next block, these say that the coefficient `D` the fuel allocation consumes is, up to a factor of
`4`, a bound on branch length and nothing about formula complexity at all. -/

/-- **The difficulty is at least the branch's length, quartered.**

The lemma that retires the visibility framing of the `DifficultyBounded` residual. Its proof is
`simp only [estimateBranchDifficulty]; omega` — the unfolding crosses the `Saturation.lean`
boundary even though `temporalCount` and `modalCount` are `private` there, because `private`
governs which names this file may *write*, not which definitions the elaborator may *unfold*. What
`omega` sees after the `simp only` is `1 + 3 * ?t + 2 * ?m + b.length / 4` with the two counters
opaque non-negative terms, and dropping two non-negative summands is all the bound needs.

Read in the contrapositive this is the whole content of the multiplicity obstruction: a bound
`estimateBranchDifficulty b ≤ D` *forces* `b.length ≤ 4 * D`, so a residual asserting the former
for every `U`-confined `b` is asserting a bound on branch length in disguise. -/

/-! #### The equivalence: a difficulty bound *is* a length bound

The pair below is **the** answer to the `DifficultyBounded` residual, and it is worth stating what
it settles. `D` looks like a bound on formula complexity — `estimateBranchDifficulty` weights
`untl`/`snce` by `3` and `box` by `2`, so the name invites that reading. It is not. Up to a factor
of `4`, `DifficultyBounded fc U D` and `StepLengthBounded fc U L` are the same hypothesis:

* forwards, `stepLengthBounded_of_difficultyBounded` turns any `D` into the length budget `4 * D`;
* backwards, `difficultyBounded_of_stepLengthBounded` turns any length budget `L` into the
  difficulty coefficient `difficultyCeiling U L`.

So the residual carries **no** information about the shapes of the formulas on a branch beyond what
confinement to `U` already gives. Everything it asks for is a bound on how *long* a successor branch
can get, and that is a statement this file can make about the engine on its own — which is what
`StepLengthGrowth` below does. The visibility of `temporalCount`/`modalCount` never entered into it. -/

/-- **The residual's real content: successors of `U`-confined branches have bounded length.**

`DifficultyBounded`'s two conjuncts verbatim — same quantifier prefix, same confinement hypothesis,
same split between the unordered successors and the `.splitOrdered` arms — with
`estimateBranchDifficulty _ ≤ D` replaced by `_.length ≤ L`. -/
def StepLengthBounded (fc : FormalSystem.ProofSystem.FrameClass) (U : Finset SignedFormula)
    (L : Nat) : Prop :=
  ∀ (b : Branch) (ord : TimeOrdering) (tr : EventualityTracker), (∀ x ∈ b, x ∈ U) →
    (∀ nb ∈ unorderedSuccessorBranches (expandOnceUnblocked b ord fc tr).1, nb.length ≤ L) ∧
    (∀ bs, (expandOnceUnblocked b ord fc tr).1 = ExpansionResult.splitOrdered bs →
        ∀ p ∈ bs, p.1.length ≤ L)

/-- **A length budget buys the difficulty coefficient outright.**

`UniverseClosed` supplies confinement of every successor, `StepLengthBounded` supplies the length,
and `estimateBranchDifficulty_le_ceiling` converts the pair into `difficultyCeiling U L`.

**On the `.splitOrdered` arms.** `UniverseClosed`'s *second* conjunct is exactly what they need, and
no extra hypothesis is required: by `expandOnceUnblocked_splitOrdered_shape` the three arms are
`(b, _)`, `(b, _)` and `(b.identifyTime t₂ t₁, _)`, so arms 1-2 are confined by the incoming
hypothesis and arm 3 by the identification clause. That the identification clause was introduced for
this shape is why it is stated about `Branch.identifyTime` rather than about the engine step.

**Correction, recorded rather than glossed.** That second conjunct is **false at every nonempty `U`**
(`universeClosed_identify_retime_false`), so this theorem is a true conditional whose closure
antecedent no caller can supply. The cause is that the conjunct quantifies the merge *target* `t₁`
over all of `TimeIndex`, whereas this proof only ever needs it at the trigger's own `t₁` — which
`firstIncomparablePair_spec` puts in `b.knownTimes`. `difficultyBounded_of_stepLengthBounded_at` is
the same statement at the repaired `UniverseClosedAt`, and it is the usable one. This theorem's
statement and proof are unchanged; the sibling is additive. Register entry 10 records the refutation. -/

/-! #### The satisfiable form, and the rule-local obligation it isolates

The equivalence above says what the residual *is*; it does not make it true, and
`difficultyBounded_multiplicity_false` says it is not. What is true is the same statement with the
incoming branch's length bounded — `DifficultyBoundedAt` — and that form is reachable from a single
rule-local growth inequality, `StepLengthGrowth`. The reduction is
`difficultyBoundedAt_ceiling`, and the difference in character between the two obligations is the
point of this block:

* `DifficultyBounded` asks for a bound on `estimateBranchDifficulty` at *every* `U`-confined branch,
  which by `estimateBranchDifficulty_length_le` means a bound on the length of every `U`-confined
  branch. Confinement provides none, and no invariant supplies one. There is nothing to prove.
* `StepLengthGrowth fc c` asks, for each of `applyRule`'s arms separately, that the emitted list be
  linear in the incoming branch. That is a finite case analysis over a fixed function, with every
  arm's answer already visible in its source text. It is left unproved **by scope decision**, not by
  discovery of an obstruction, and the obligation map below is recorded so a follow-up needs no
  fresh reconnaissance. -/

/-- **The rule-local growth obligation: every successor is linear in the branch it came from.**

`c` is a parameter, so the constant may be widened freely without restating anything downstream.
`RunInvariant b ord` is present because four arms emit a list indexed by the *ordering* rather than
by the branch, and only `OrdTimesKnown` ties the two together.

### The obligation map

`applyRule` (`Tableau.lean:630`) has **36** arms. Every one is accounted for here; the largest
emitted list anywhere is `2 + 4 * b.length`, so a successor `formulas ++ b` has length at most
`2 + 5 * b.length` and `c = 5` suffices.

**Constant arms** — emitted length independent of the branch:
* `.andPos` 635, `.orNeg` 650, `.impNeg` 658: exactly `2`.
* `.andNeg` 640, `.orPos` 645, `.impPos` 655: `.branching`, each arm exactly `1`.
* `.negPos` 661, `.negNeg` 666: exactly `1`.
* `.boxTemporal` 743: a `filter` of a two-element list, so at most `2`.
* `.orderTrichotomy` 1282: `.branching` with three arms, each of length exactly `2`
  (`[pos d l0, sf]`).
* `.denseIndicatorClosure` 1331: `.linear []`, length `0`.
* `.priorUZ` 1388, `.priorSZ` 1398, `.z1Rule` 1408, `.priorUGap` 1429, `.priorSGap` 1445,
  `.sepRule` 1464: six arms, each `.persistent [newSf]`, length exactly `1`.
* `.serialityRule` 1486: a `filter` of a two-element list, so at most `2`.

**Branch-mapped arms** — emitted length `Θ(b.length)`, thirteen of them:
* `.boxPos` 671 and `.diamondNeg` 731: one `filterMap` over `branch.knownWorlds`, so at most
  `b.length`.
* `.boxNeg` 679 and `.diamondPos` 704: `witness :: boxProps ++ diaProps`, two `filterMap`s over
  branch selectors, so at most `1 + 2 * b.length`.
* `.densityRule` 1338: `witness :: gProps`, so at most `1 + b.length`.
* `.allFutureNeg` 760, `.allPastNeg` 800, `.someFuturePos` 831, `.somePastPos` 875:
  `witness :: gProps ++ fNegProps ++ modalProps`, where `modalProps` is
  `boxDiamondPersistence` (`Tableau.lean:434-442`) and is itself two branch `filterMap`s
  concatenated — four branch-length terms in all, so at most `1 + 4 * b.length`.
* the `.branching` arms of `.untlPos` 921, `.sncePos` 968, `.untlNeg` 1013, `.snceNeg` 1144:
  `[…] ++ autoProp` with `autoProp = gProps ++ fNegProps ++ modalProps`, so at most
  `2 + 4 * b.length`. **These are the widest arms in the function**, and they are what fixes
  `c = 5`.

**Ordering-driven arms** — four of them, and the reason `RunInvariant` appears in the hypothesis:
* `.allFuturePos` 751 and `.someFutureNeg` 863 `filterMap` over `timeOrd.futureOf l.time`;
  `.allPastPos` 791 and `.somePastNeg` 907 over `timeOrd.pastOf l.time`.
* `futureOf`/`pastOf` (`SignedFormula.lean:776`, `782`) are duplicate-free: `reachableForward` and
  `reachableBackward` (`SignedFormula.lean:741-758`) `eraseDups` each layer and filter it against
  the visited set. Every element is the target of an ordering constraint, so `OrdTimesKnown`
  (`MintBound.lean:1260`) puts it in `b.knownTimes`, whose length is at most `b.length` because
  `Branch.knownTimes` is a map-then-`eraseDups` of `b`. Hence at most `b.length` again — but only
  under the invariant, which is why the invariant is a hypothesis here and not in
  `StepLengthBounded`.

**The `.branchingOrdered` arm** — `.timeLinearity` 1513, the one already-benign family: its three
arms are `(b, _)`, `(b, _)` and `(b.identifyTime t₂ t₁, _)`, and `Branch.identifyTime` is
`(b.map relabel).eraseDups`, so all three have length at most `b.length` with no `c` needed. -/

`DifficultyBounded`'s two conjuncts with `RunInvariant b ord` and `b.length ≤ L` added as
hypotheses, in `MintPaysForTime`'s hypothesis order so the residual family reads uniformly. The
added length hypothesis is precisely what `difficultyBounded_multiplicity_false` shows cannot be
dispensed with: without it the statement is false at every `D`. -/

/-- **The reduction.** A rule-local growth constant plus universe closure gives the satisfiable form
of the difficulty residual outright, with `D` read off as `difficultyCeiling U (c * L + c)`.

Proving `StepLengthGrowth fc c` for a concrete `c` — the map on `StepLengthGrowth` says `c = 5`
works — would therefore turn this into an **unconditional** discharge of the satisfiable form,
which is the furthest this residual can be taken. -/

/-! #### The residual as literally stated is refutable, at every `D`

The refutation, in one paragraph. Take `sf₀ := F(p → q)` at the initial label and
`U₀ := {sf₀, T p, F q}` — closed enough that `sf₀`'s one step stays inside it. Take
`b := List.replicate n sf₀`: a branch consisting of `n` copies of a single formula, which is
`U₀`-confined for every `n` because confinement is a statement about *membership*, not about
multiplicity. The engine's step at `b` is `.impNeg`, emitting `[T p, F q]`, so the successor has
length `n + 2`, and `estimateBranchDifficulty_length_le` puts its difficulty at least
`1 + (n + 2) / 4`. Instantiating at `n := 4·D + 4` makes that `D + 2`, which exceeds `D`. Hence no
`D` bounds the difficulty of the successors of `U₀`-confined branches, and
`DifficultyBounded fc U₀ D` is false — at **every** `D` and at **every** frame class.

**Why the reduction goes through generically in `n`.** Every engine function the step consults is
insensitive to the duplication:

* `blockedTimes b ord fc tr` is `b.knownTimes.filter (isTemporallyBlockedSaturated …)`, and at
  `ord = TimeOrdering.empty` the candidate list `blockCandidates` is empty at every time, so the
  filter's predicate is `false` everywhere. `blockedTimes_empty` records this for an **arbitrary**
  branch, frame class and tracker — it is not a fact about this witness at all.
* `findUnexpandedUnblockedWith` is a `List.find?`, so it short-circuits on the head, which is `sf₀`.
* `findApplicableRule` consults `allRulesForFC fc`, whose first three entries are the Dedekind rules
  and whose next two are `.negPos`/`.negNeg`; all five are inapplicable to a `.neg`-signed
  implication between atoms, so `.impNeg` — third in `allRules` — is the first rule to fire, at every
  frame class. Its `fs.all branch.contains` guard passes because `T p` is not among the copies of
  `sf₀`.

None of this is a `decide` on a fixed `n`: `findApplicableRule_multWitness` holds for any branch not
already carrying `T p`, and `expandOnceUnblocked_multBranch` for any `n ≥ 1`. -/

theorem length_multBranch (n : Nat) : (multBranch n).length = n := by simp [multBranch]

/-- **`DifficultyBounded fc U D` is refuted, at every `D` and every frame class.**

Not merely unproved: false. The witness is `multUniverse` and the padded branch
`multBranch (4 * D + 4)`, which is `U`-confined because confinement is about membership, and whose
`.impNeg` successor has length `4 * D + 6` and hence difficulty at least `D + 2`.

This is why the landed terminus's `hD` hypothesis is unsatisfiable at any universe the engine fires
on, and hence why `buildTableauAt_isSome_of_lengthBudget` is a repair rather than a convenience: the
`DifficultyBounded`-shaped statements are true conditionals that no caller can discharge. The
repaired hypothesis is `StepLengthBounded`, and `stepLengthBounded_of_difficultyBounded` shows the
exchange loses nothing that was ever available.

Note where the refutation does **not** come from. It is not about formula complexity — the witness is
an implication between two atoms, with zero temporal and zero modal operators, so both of
`estimateBranchDifficulty`'s weighted counters are `0` on it. The entire refutation runs through the
`b.length / 4` term. Making `temporalCount` and `modalCount` public in `Saturation.lean` would leave
every step of this argument intact. -/

Both residual disjuncts are discharged, and the second is the interesting one: a mint may raise the
known-time count by as much as it lowered the potential, so the rank may rise by that many units of
`Tmax² + 1` plus a full incomparable-pair range. The weight `2·(Tmax² + 1)` pays for both with a
unit left over, which is why the drop is by at least one however many times the step mints. -/

The measure is instantiated at `σ = id`, which is the intrinsic mint potential: the renaming is
introduced by the run's own identification arms, not by the statement.

**The residual hypotheses, listed as the phase's scope hypothesis requires.** Four appear, and each
is named above with what would discharge it: `UniverseClosed` (closure of `U` under the engine's
steps *and* under an identification's relabelling), `DifficultyBounded` and `β ≥ 3` (the two
coefficients `splitAwareFuel` already carries as an interface), `MintPaysForTime` (the time
dimension — the one genuinely open mathematical obligation, carrying the σ-hit/time-reuse question,
and discharged outright on the `untl`/`snce`-free fragment by section D3)
and `ArmSettlement` (`resolveOpenArm`'s reachable `none`, which `Fuel.lean` carries in the same
form). None of them is the unbranching restriction under another name: each is a bound or a
closure condition, all
four `ExpansionResult` shapes remain admissible under every one of them, and
`branchingWitness_splits` exhibits a branch at which the engine genuinely splits.

`BudgetedTotality`'s branch-budget hypothesis is `branchesUsed + β · fuel ≤ maxBranches`, which at
`β = 0` says only `branchesUsed ≤ maxBranches` — and the engine's very first line returns `none`
when `branchesUsed ≥ maxBranches`. Taking both to be zero satisfies every hypothesis and refutes
the conclusion, at every frame class, every difficulty coefficient and every branch.

This is why `BudgetedTotalityAt` above is stated with `β ≥ 3` on the theorem rather than with the
budget hypothesis left as it stands: `β ≥ 1` is what makes the budget hypothesis strict, and
`β ≥ 3` is what the measured split arity asks for. A reader who "simplifies" the coefficient away
is re-attempting a refuted statement. -/

`expandBranchWithFuel_isSome_of_budget` would be worth nothing if its hypotheses secretly excluded

name while keeping
the exclusion would be removing it in name only. The witness below is the mechanical check: at a
branch carrying `T(p → q)` the engine's step is a genuine `.split` with two arms, and the expansion
still terminates. The check is by evaluation and by `decide`, not by inspection. -/

/-! ## C8. The terminus at `buildTableauAt`

`expandBranchWithFuel` is one of four things `buildTableauAt` calls, and the other three have to be
discharged before totality of the expansion becomes totality of the entry point. Two of them are
landed and go through unchanged; the third is the arm that made the original entry point non-total,
and it is **still there**.

### The post-blocking arm is not eliminated by the certificate change — a correction

The expectation carried into this phase was that replacing the literal saturation test with the
engine's blocking-aware one removes `buildTableauAt`'s `| some _ => none  -- Still not saturated
after post-blocking` arm. Reading the landed function rather than the expectation: that arm is
present, textually, in `Saturation.lean`'s definition of `buildTableauAt`, and the certificate
change did not remove it. What the change removed is the *permanent* disagreement — the literal
test counts label-introducing work that `saturateBlocked` refuses by construction, so it could
never stop reporting it, at any fuel — and the measured probes confirm that the formulas which
died there now settle. What it did not do is prove the arm unreachable.

So the arm is discharged here the only honest way: by a **named hypothesis**,
`PostBlockingSettles`, that says the post-blocking pass leaves a blocking-aware saturated branch.
That hypothesis also settles `resolveOpenArm` (`armSettlement_of_postBlockingSettles`), because
`resolveOpenArm`'s own `none` arm is the same test on the same branch — so the terminus carries
**one** settlement residual, not two, and it is the same one the fuel induction consumes.

`resolveOpenArm` and `buildTableauAt` are not interchangeable, which is why the bridge is proved
rather than asserted: `resolveOpenArm` tests `findClosure satBr` before the saturation test and
reports the arm closed if it fires, and `buildTableauAt` does not. `ArmSettlement` alone is
therefore strictly too weak for the terminus, and `PostBlockingSettles` is what covers both.

### What the terminus does discharge

* the `expandBranchWithFuel` call — Phase 13's theorem, at the seed;
* `RunInvariant` — discharged **inside**, by `runInvariant_initial`, and absent from the statement.
  It is vacuous at `TimeOrdering.empty` because that ordering has no constraints, which is a
  property of the engine's seed and not of a narrowed statement;
* the `saturateBlocked` call's `none` arm — the landed `saturateBlocked_ne_none`, so the plan's
  "provably dead" annotation on that arm is consumed rather than trusted. -/

/-- **The post-blocking settlement residual.**

The post-blocking pass leaves a branch that the blocking-aware saturation test certifies. This is
the one statement that closes both `resolveOpenArm`'s `none` arm and `buildTableauAt`'s, and it is
**false**: `saturateBlocked` at `fuel = 0` returns its input unchanged, and above zero it stops when
no *label-free* work remains, which is a weaker condition than the saturation test it is measured
against.

**The open question this docstring used to pose is decided, and the answer is no.** It read
"whether the gap can be closed by fuel alone is exactly the question `Saturation.lean` leaves open,
and nothing here decides it"; section C12 decides it. `postBlockingSettles_fuel_zero_false` refutes
the predicate at the `fuel = 0` arm and `postBlockingSettles_fuel_gap_false` refutes it at a nonzero
one, both at every frame class, and `postBlockingSettles_gap_at_every_fuel` exhibits both halves of
the disagreement simultaneously at **every** fuel figure. Fuel does not close it, because
`expandOnceNoFresh` *skips* label-minting candidates while `findUnexpandedUnblockedWith` counts
them, and no fuel figure appears anywhere in that disagreement. Register entry 22 records it.

The statement is retained verbatim, and the terminus chain still names it, because nothing in this
file is withdrawn — but it is a conditional no caller can discharge, in the same sense as
`DifficultyBounded` (entry 9), `UniverseClosed`'s clause 2 (entry 10) and `MintPaysForTime`
(entry 14).

**The settled repair is `PostBlockingSettlesRun`**, this statement with the pass's input branch
restricted to a branch some `expandBranchWithFuel` call returned open, at that call's own fuel —
which is the only way `buildTableauAt` reaches it. `postBlockingSettlesRun_of_postBlockingSettles`
fixes the direction: the hypothesis list is longer, so the predicate is **weaker**, so every
theorem restated against it is a **strengthening**. `buildTableauAt_isSome_of_budget_run` and its
siblings are the termini stated at it, and `buildTableauAt_isSome_of_budget_of_run` certifies the
strengthening by re-deriving the landed statement from the restated one. Entry 23 records the
repair that was tried first and rejected, and why this one is not that.

It is a hypothesis wherever it appears, and it is never an axiom. -/

**THE TERMINUS.** `buildTableauAt` is total at the derived fuel figure and a quantified branch
budget, with the branching arms discharged rather than excluded.

Read against what this replaces: `buildTableau_isSome` is false at the engine's default budget at
*any* fuel, and the register below records why. This statement quantifies the budget, names the
fuel figure it earns, discharges `RunInvariant` at the seed via `runInvariant_initial` so that it
does **not** appear as a caller obligation, and applies to runs that branch — both split shapes are
proved, not confined.

**The residuals, stated once.** `UniverseClosed`, `DifficultyBounded` with `β ≥ 3`,
`MintPaysForTime` and `PostBlockingSettles`, each with its own docstring above saying what would
discharge it. The mint budget is **not** among them: it is a parameter this development discharges
(`mintPotential_le_eight_mul` supplies the ceiling outright), and the time bound is derived from it
rather than assumed (`derivedTmax_spec`).

**One of the four is refutable, and has a repaired sibling.** `DifficultyBounded fc U D` is false at
**every** `D` whenever `U` contains a formula the engine fires on, because
`estimateBranchDifficulty` sums over the branch *list* and confinement to `U` bounds only its
`toFinset`. The witness is `difficultyBounded_multiplicity_false`; register entry 9 below records the
cause; and the docstring on `DifficultyBounded` itself corrects the older, wrong explanation that
blamed `Saturation.lean`'s `private` markers. This theorem is therefore a true conditional whose
antecedent no caller can supply. The usable form is `buildTableauAt_isSome_of_lengthBudget` (and
`buildTableauAt_isSome_at_seed_lengthBudget`), which is this statement with the difficulty
hypothesis exchanged for the branch-**length** hypothesis `StepLengthBounded fc U L` that
`difficultyBounded_of_stepLengthBounded` shows is sufficient. Nothing below is withdrawn: the
statement and proof here are unchanged, and the sibling is additive.

/-! ### The sibling terminus, at the length budget

The two theorems above are stated against `DifficultyBounded`, and `DifficultyBounded` is
**refutable at every `D`** at any universe the engine fires on
(`difficultyBounded_multiplicity_false`). They are not thereby wrong — they are conditionals, and a
conditional with an unsatisfiable antecedent is true — but a caller cannot use them, which is a
defect worth repairing rather than describing.

The repair is a substitution, not a re-proof. `StepLengthBounded fc U L` is `DifficultyBounded`'s
own statement with `estimateBranchDifficulty _ ≤ D` weakened to `_.length ≤ L`, it implies
`DifficultyBounded fc U (difficultyCeiling U L)` under `UniverseClosed`
(`difficultyBounded_of_stepLengthBounded`), and it is satisfiable — `StepLengthGrowth` reduces it to
a finite case analysis over `applyRule`'s 36 arms. So the siblings below are the landed termini with
one hypothesis exchanged and `D` read off as `difficultyCeiling U L`; each is a single application of
the landed theorem, with no new induction and no change to `stepDecreases_budgetPotential`.

**What changed is the *shape* of one residual, and only that.** `UniverseClosed`,
`MintPaysForTime`, `PostBlockingSettles` and `β ≥ 3` are carried across unaltered and are still
named. `Fuel.lean` needs nothing new: every occurrence of `D` in the terminus chain flows through
`mintAwareFuel`'s `D` argument (`mintAwareFuel`, `stepDecreases_budgetPotential`,
`expandBranchWithFuel_isSome_of_budget`), all inside this file, so instantiating it at
`difficultyCeiling U L` is a substitution into statements that already quantify over it. -/

/-- **The terminus at a branch-length budget.** `buildTableauAt_isSome_of_budget` with
`hD : DifficultyBounded fc U D` replaced by `hL : StepLengthBounded fc U L`, and every `D`
instantiated at `difficultyCeiling U L`. Unlike its `DifficultyBounded` sibling, this statement's
difficulty hypothesis is not refutable. -/

/-! ## C10. The repaired closure residual, and the chain stated at it

`UniverseClosed`'s second conjunct is refuted above at every nonempty `U`
(`universeClosed_identify_retime_false`), so the four theorems that assume it are conditionals no
caller can discharge. This section supplies the repair and restates the chain at it.

**The repair, and why it is exactly this.** Clause 2's defect is a single unconstrained quantifier:
the merge *target* `t₁`. `UniverseClosedAt` restricts it to `b.knownTimes` and changes nothing else
— clause 1 is carried verbatim and the merge *source* `t₂` stays free. Restricting `t₂` as well
would weaken the predicate for no gain, since the proof of
`timeMergeClosed_identifyTime_signedUniverse` below never appeals to it; register entry 12 records
that as a tempting-but-wrong repair.

**The restriction is free at every consuming site**, which is what makes this a repair rather than a
new caller obligation. Both sites that consume clause 2 reach `t₁` through
`expandOnceUnblocked_splitOrdered_shape`, which returns the trigger
`firstIncomparablePair b ord = some (t₁, t₂)` alongside the arms; `firstIncomparablePair_spec`
turns that trigger into `t₁ ∈ b.knownTimes` on the spot. So the hypothesis is discharged locally and
never surfaces on the terminus.

### DIVERGENCE, recorded: the chain is restated additively, not generalized in place

The plan's Phase 3 wrote this as an in-place generalization of the ten signatures carrying
`hUcl : UniverseClosed fc U`, with the original shapes retained afterwards as corollaries. It is
done the other way round here: **every one of those ten theorems is left byte-identical**, and the
chain at the repaired predicate is added alongside under `…_at` names. Two reasons, both of which
the plan's own acceptance criteria prefer:

* Its Testing & Validation asks that "every pre-existing theorem statement still resolves by name
  with the same statement". An in-place hypothesis-type change alters ten landed statements —
  including **the** terminus — and would have satisfied that criterion only by renaming the
  generalized forms anyway, which is what is done here directly.
* The landed terminus's proof terms stay untouched, so nothing about the parent development has to
  be re-verified.

The cost is that the two arithmetic step lemmas are restated rather than shared. They are not
weakened: `budgetPotential_step_unordered_at` and `budgetPotential_step_splitOrdered_at` have the
identical conclusions, and the only difference in either proof is which projection supplies
confinement. A reader who wants the shared form should factor the confinement facts out as
hypotheses (`∀ x ∈ nb, x ∈ U` for the unordered lemma, and the trigger-indexed form for the ordered
one) and derive all four from those two — that refactor would touch the landed proofs and is
deliberately not done here. -/

/-- **The repaired closure residual.** Clause 1 verbatim from `UniverseClosed`; clause 2 with the
merge target `t₁` restricted to a time the branch already knows.

`UniverseClosed` is strictly stronger — `universeClosedAt_of_universeClosed` is the implication, and
the converse fails at every nonempty `U` by `universeClosed_identify_retime_false`, so the two are
genuinely not interchangeable.

**What the repair does and does not fix, stated precisely.** It repairs clause **2**, which as stated
was satisfiable only at `U = ∅` and is now dischargeable at `U = signedUniverse C L` from a closure
condition on the label set (`timeMergeClosed_identifyTime_signedUniverse`). It does **not** touch
clause 1, which is carried verbatim and has an independent defect in its label coordinate:
`universeClosedAt_fresh_world_escapes` refutes this very predicate at a concrete `signedUniverse C L`.
So `UniverseClosedAt` is not satisfiable at an arbitrary `signedUniverse C L` either.
`universeClosedAt_signedUniverse_of_headroom` is what it takes — the two stock conditions, the label
closure condition, and one named residual for clause 1's label coordinate. -/
def UniverseClosedAt (fc : FormalSystem.ProofSystem.FrameClass) (U : Finset SignedFormula) : Prop :=
  (∀ (b : Branch) (ord : TimeOrdering) (tr : EventualityTracker), (∀ x ∈ b, x ∈ U) →
      ∀ nb ∈ unorderedSuccessorBranches (expandOnceUnblocked b ord fc tr).1, ∀ x ∈ nb, x ∈ U) ∧
  (∀ (b : Branch) (t₁ t₂ : TimeIndex), (∀ x ∈ b, x ∈ U) → t₁ ∈ b.knownTimes →
      ∀ x ∈ b.identifyTime t₂ t₁, x ∈ U)

/-- **The direction, stated explicitly.** `UniverseClosedAt` is the **weaker** hypothesis, so every
theorem restated against it is a **strengthening** of its `UniverseClosed`-shaped predecessor — the
same sense in which `ordTimesLeMaxTime_of_ordTimesKnown` records that `OrdTimesKnown` strengthens
the run invariant rather than weakening it.

The converse is **false** whenever `U` is nonempty, by `universeClosed_identify_retime_false`: there
is no `UniverseClosed`-shaped theorem to be recovered from a `UniverseClosedAt`-shaped one, and none
is wanted, since the stronger hypothesis is the unsatisfiable one. -/

    {U : Finset SignedFormula} (h : UniverseClosed fc U) : UniverseClosedAt fc U :=
  ⟨h.1, fun b t₁ t₂ hbU _ => h.2 b t₁ t₂ hbU⟩

/-- **Clause 2, supplied at an ordered split's trigger.** The bridge that makes the restriction
free: at any branch where `timeLinearity` fires, the arm-3 merge target is a known time, so
`UniverseClosedAt`'s restricted clause applies with nothing extra assumed.

This is the single lemma that would have to fail for the repair to have leaked a new hypothesis into
the terminus. It does not fail: `firstIncomparablePair_spec` is exactly what it needs. -/

  h.2 b t₁ t₂ hbU (firstIncomparablePair_spec htrig).1

/-- **Clause 2 at the engine's own orientation.** The oriented merge target is `max t₁ t₂`, and
`firstIncomparablePair_spec_oriented` puts it in `b.knownTimes` exactly as the unoriented spec puts
`t₁` there. Clause 2 is discharged *as it stands*: it already quantifies its source time freely and
restricts only its target, so swapping which member of the pair is which costs one fact the trigger
already supplies and adds no hypothesis. That is register entry 12's finding paying off — had
clause 2 been "repaired" by constraining both times, this bridge would have needed a fact no
trigger supplies. -/

/-! ### The closure condition on the label set, and the repaired clause 2 at `signedUniverse C L`

The repaired clause 2 *is* a caller's obligation about the label set, and this is it. The condition
is small, it is exactly what the clause reduces to, and it is satisfiable — the three things the
`DifficultyBounded` episode showed a residual has to be before it is worth stating.

Why it takes this shape: an identification moves a label's **time** coordinate and leaves its world
coordinate and its formula alone. So confinement of `b.identifyTime t₂ t₁` needs `L` to contain
`⟨z.label.world, t₁⟩` for each `z ∈ b`, and `t₁` is a time some `y ∈ b` already carries. Both
`z.label` and `y.label` are in `L`, so the requirement is precisely closure of `L` under taking one
member's world with another's time. -/

/-- **The closure condition on the label set.** `L` contains every label built from one member's
world and another member's time.

This is exactly the reduction of `UniverseClosedAt`'s clause 2 at `U = signedUniverse C L`, and
`timeMergeClosed_identifyTime_signedUniverse` is the reduction. It is used **once** in that proof, at
the retimed case, which is the check that it is neither stronger nor weaker than needed.

Satisfiable and non-vacuous: `timeMergeClosed_product` exhibits a whole family satisfying it, and
`timeMergeClosed_iff_product` shows the family is *all* of them — a `TimeMergeClosed` label set is
precisely a full rectangle of worlds against times. -/
def TimeMergeClosed (L : Finset Label) : Prop :=
  ∀ l ∈ L, ∀ l' ∈ L, (⟨l.world, l'.time⟩ : Label) ∈ L

/-- **The satisfiability witness.** Every rectangular label set — all of `Ws` against all of `Ts` —
is time-merge closed. Without this the condition could be vacuous, which is the failure mode
`DifficultyBounded` fell into: a residual nobody can satisfy makes its theorem a true conditional
with no reach. -/

`TimeMergeClosed` supplies it once `t₁` is exhibited as `y.label.time` for some `y ∈ b`, which is
what `t₁ ∈ b.knownTimes` gives via `exists_mem_of_mem_knownTimes`.

**`t₂` is not constrained**, and the proof shows why it need not be: the source time is only ever
tested against, never used to build a label. Constraining it too would weaken the predicate for
nothing — register entry 12. -/

/-! ### Clause 1's label dimension is refuted at a fixed finite `signedUniverse C L`

Clause 2 was the residual's *fatal* defect and `UniverseClosedAt` repairs it. Clause 1 has a second,
**independent** defect, and this subsection settles it rather than assuming either way. The verdict is
that clause 1 is refutable at a fixed finite `signedUniverse C L` — so `UniverseClosedAt` is not
satisfiable at an arbitrary `signedUniverse C L` either, and the repair of clause 2 does not rescue
it. Both predicates carry clause 1 verbatim, so one witness refutes both.

**The cause: fresh worlds.** `applyRule_boxNeg_emitted_world` and
`applyRule_diamondPos_emitted_world` prove those two rules emit **only** at `Branch.nextWorld`, and
`nextWorld_not_mem_worldFinset` says that world is fresh — not a world of `b` at all. So a branch
confined to `signedUniverse C L` whose worlds exhaust `L`'s worlds has a `boxNeg` successor whose
label is outside `L` by construction. `freshWorldBranch` below is the minimal such configuration:
one formula, `F(□p)` at `⟨0, 0⟩`, and `L = {⟨0, 0⟩}`.

**Why blocking does not save it.** Clause 1 quantifies over **every** tracker `tr` and every ordering
`ord`, and the witness below is proved at every one of them. `blocking_fires_of_card_lt` would need
an `allEventualitiesFulfilledOrDuplicated` guard that clause 1's caller never gets to supply.

**Why no closure condition on `L` repairs it, unlike clause 2.** `freshWorldHeadroom_not_universal`
is the general statement: for **no** nonempty finite `L` whatsoever does every `L`-confined branch
have its next world already in `L`. Each enlargement of `L` raises the reachable `maxWorld` by at
least as much as it adds, so the gap re-opens. The repair therefore cannot live in `L` — it has to be
a **branch-side headroom** hypothesis, which is what `FreshWorldHeadroom` below states and what
register entry 11 records. -/

`applyRule_diamondPos_emitted_world`), and this is exactly the label set membership their emissions
require. It is stated about the **branch**, not about `L`, and

For every nonempty finite `L` there is an `L`-confined branch whose `Branch.nextWorld` is outside
`L` — take a branch sitting at `L`'s largest world, whose next world is one higher. Enlarging `L` to
cover it raises the largest world too, so the gap re-opens at every enlargement. Contrast clause 2,
where `TimeMergeClosed` closes the analogous gap outright because identification moves a label
*within* the existing coordinates rather than past them.

This is why `FreshWorldHeadroom` is a hypothesis about the **branch**, not about `L`: as a condition
on `L` alone, quantified over the confined branches it would have to serve, it is unsatisfiable. -/

/-! ### Clause 1's formula dimension, unconditionally, at both unordered shapes

Clause 1 has two independent halves, and separating them is what makes the situation legible: the
**formula** coordinate of every successor stays inside `C` outright, with no side condition beyond
what `Fuel.lean` already asks; the **label** coordinate is the one that escapes
(`universeClosed_fresh_world_escapes`). Proving the formula half here, in full, is what shows the
refutation above is not a defect of the whole clause — it is confined to one coordinate.

`.extended` is `expandOnceUnblocked_extended_mem`, already landed in `Fuel.lean`. `.split` had no
analogue, and `expandOnceUnblocked_split_mem` is it. The `.splitOrdered` and `.saturated` shapes are
vacuous here because `unorderedSuccessorBranches` is `[]` on both. -/

`bss.flatten`, so `applyRule_subformula_closed` — which is stated over `emitted` — already covers the
branching arms. What was missing is only the pick-stage destructuring, which is
`expandOnceUnblocked_extended_mem`'s own three-stage `rcases` with `pick_result_mem` (which handles
only `.linear`/`.persistent`) replaced by `applyRule_subformula_closed` directly.

/-! ### Clause 1's label dimension: the honest maximum, and where the obstruction actually sits

Phase order in this section: the formula dimension is **proved** above; the label dimension is
**refuted** as a property of a fixed finite `L` (`universeClosed_fresh_world_escapes`) and cannot be
repaired by any condition on `L` (`freshWorldHeadroom_not_universal`). What remains is to say exactly
how much of the label dimension is available and what the residue costs. That is done here, in the
style `StepLengthGrowth`'s docstring uses for its own obligation map: per rule shape, which lemma
supplies it, and which piece is absent. Read this together with section C11, which spends the time
analogue once it lands and settles that the obstruction is the world coordinate's refutation rather
than any absent lemma.

**The world coordinate is fully accounted for.** `applyRule_emitted_world_dichotomy` below is the
complete statement: every emitted formula sits either at a world the branch already has or at
`Branch.nextWorld`, with no third possibility, assembled from the landed 34 × 2 split
(`applyRule_emitted_world_mem`) and the two minting lemmas. So the world half of the label dimension
needs nothing beyond `FreshWorldHeadroom`.

**The time coordinate now has its analogue.** An earlier version of this note said there was no
`applyRule_emitted_time_mem` and that the label dimension was blocked on its absence. That is no
longer the state of the file: section D1 lands it, together with `freshTimeRules` (the census the
note said no statement supplied), `applyRule_emitted_time_dichotomy`, and the engine-level
`unorderedSuccessor_time_dichotomy`. The census is nine rules wide and is **incomparable** with
`ruleMintsFreshLabel` in both directions — `freshTimeRules_incomparable_freshLabelRules` decides
that, which is the precise content the old note gestured at when it observed that `densityRule` and
the `untlNeg` / `snceNeg` ACTIVE arms mint times while sitting outside the witness-guarded list.

One asymmetry with the world coordinate is real and is not a gap in the proof:
`applyRule_emitted_time_mem` carries `OrdTimesKnown b ord` where its world twin carries nothing,
because four rules propagate to `TimeOrdering.futureOf` / `pastOf` and nothing in `applyRule` ties
an ordering time to the branch. `applyRule_emitted_time_mem_ordTimesKnown_needed` decides that the
hypothesis is not removable, and `expandOnceUnblocked_ordTimesKnown` supplies it at every consuming
site, so nothing new reaches the terminus.

`UnorderedSuccessorLabelClosed` below is nevertheless **still a named residual**, for the reason
recorded on its own docstring: the world half of the label dimension is refuted at a fixed finite
`L` (`universeClosed_fresh_world_escapes`) and no condition on `L` repairs it
(`freshWorldHeadroom_not_universal`). The time accounting that was missing has landed; the world-side
obstruction is what remains, and it was never the missing lemma.

**What is delivered, then**: clause 1 at `signedUniverse C L` reduced to the label dimension **alone**

rules that introduce no world, and `applyRule_boxNeg_emitted_world` /
`applyRule_diamondPos_emitted_world` cover the two that do, each pinning the emission to
`Branch.nextWorld` exactly. This is the world-coordinate half of clause 1's label dimension, and it
is the half that is available. -/

/-- **Clause 1's label dimension, as a named residual.**

Exactly the label half of `UniverseClosedAt`'s first conjunct, separated out because the formula half
is proved (`unorderedSuccessor_formula_mem`) and this half is not. It is a hypothesis, it is named,
and nothing in this file assumes it.

**The obligation map.** What discharging this needs, per coordinate:

*The world coordinate — available.* `applyRule_emitted_world_dichotomy` is the complete accounting:
every emission is at a world of `b` or at `Branch.nextWorld`. The first case is covered by
`L`-confinement of `b`; the second is exactly what `FreshWorldHeadroom L b` supplies. Note the
headroom must be branch-side: `freshWorldHeadroom_not_universal` proves that no nonempty finite `L`
supplies it for all `L`-confined branches, so this cannot be turned into a closure condition on `L`
the way `TimeMergeClosed` was for clause 2.

*The time coordinate — available, since section D1.* An earlier version of this paragraph said there
was **no** `applyRule_emitted_time_mem`, that the rule *list* was unsettled, and that supplying the
analogue was a 36-arm accounting owned elsewhere. That is no longer the state of the file:
`applyRule_emitted_time_mem`, `applyRule_emitted_time_dichotomy` and the engine-level
`unorderedSuccessor_time_dichotomy` have landed, and `freshTimeRules` is the census the old paragraph
said no statement supplied. `freshTimeRules_incomparable_freshLabelRules` decides that the census is
incomparable with `ruleMintsFreshLabel` in **both** directions, which is the precise content the old
paragraph gestured at when it observed that `densityRule` and the `untlNeg` / `snceNeg` active arms
mint times while sitting outside the witness-guarded list. One hypothesis comes with the analogue,
`OrdTimesKnown b ord`, and `applyRule_emitted_time_mem_ordTimesKnown_needed` decides that it is not
removable; `ordTimesKnown_empty` and `expandOnceUnblocked_ordTimesKnown` supply it at every consuming
site, so it is not new currency.

*Both coordinates together are still not this residual, and that is now proved rather than pending.*
Section C11 spends the completed accounting: `unorderedSuccessor_label_mem_of_headroom` proves the
label dimension outright from the branch-side rectangle `FreshLabelHeadroom`, and
`unorderedSuccessorLabelClosedOrd_of_headroom` reduces the residual to that rectangle holding at every
`L`-confined branch. The reduction is complete and the residual nevertheless survives, because
`freshLabelHeadroom_not_universal` refutes the rectangle at every nonempty finite `L`. The obstruction
was always the *world* coordinate's refutation (`universeClosed_fresh_world_escapes`,
`freshWorldHeadroom_not_universal`), never the missing time lemma. Two structural facts are worth
carrying away: a label is a **pair**, so per-coordinate dichotomies leave four quadrants rather than
two; and confinement of `b` covers none of the four, because it constrains the pairs `b` carries and
not their cross product.

*The `.splitOrdered` shape does not arise*, because `unorderedSuccessorBranches` is `[]` on it —
that shape's confinement is clause 2's business and is discharged by
`timeMergeClosed_identifyTime_signedUniverse`. -/

/-- **Clause 1 at `signedUniverse C L`, reduced to the label dimension alone.**

The deliverable of the label-dimension phase. `TableauClosed C` and `TrichStock C` discharge the
formula coordinate outright via `unorderedSuccessor_formula_mem`; what is left is exactly
`UnorderedSuccessorLabelClosed`, whose obligation map is on its own docstring. So the residue is
one coordinate, not two, and it is explicit rather than absorbed.

This is clause 1 of `UniverseClosedAt fc (signedUniverse C L)` in the form
`universeClosedAt_signedUniverse_of_headroom` consumes. -/

/-- **The label residual is refuted at this `L`** — the single-witness form, retained as the file's
original record of the finding. `universeClosed_fresh_world_escapes`'s configuration, read at the
residual's own shape: the one-formula branch `[F(□p)@⟨0,0⟩]` is confined to
`freshWorldLabels = {⟨0,0⟩}`, its step fires `.boxNeg` at every frame class and every tracker, and
the emitted `F(p)` sits at world `1`.

**The bracket this docstring used to state is false, and section C11 proves it false.** An earlier
version said the residual "holds at every `L` for which the engine never fires", and bracketed it as
*refutable at some `signedUniverse C L`, satisfiable at others*, so that the composite above would be
genuinely conditional without being vacuous. Neither half survives:
`unorderedSuccessorLabelClosed_nonempty_false` refutes the residual at **every** nonempty finite `L`,
at every frame class, and `unorderedSuccessorLabelClosed_empty` proves it at `∅`. Its satisfiability
set is therefore exactly `{∅}` — so the "engine never fires" class is not a substantive class of
label sets, it is the one-element class `{∅}`. And `signedUniverse C ∅ = ∅`, so at the only `L` where
the hypothesis is available the universe is empty and every consumer of it is a true conditional with
no reach. Register entries 11 and 21 carry the consequence for the nine theorems that take this
predicate as a hypothesis.

The statement and proof below are unchanged and are **not** withdrawn: the single witness is what the
sections between here and C11 cite, and `UnorderedSuccessorLabelClosedOrd` — needed to state the
generalized form — is not defined until C11, so the general form could not be stated here. -/

/-! ### The composite at the concrete universe, and the terminus that consumes it

What the section has established, assembled. `UniverseClosedAt fc (signedUniverse C L)` follows from
three conditions plus one named residual, and each of the four is where it belongs:

| Conjunct | Discharged by | Cost |
|----------|---------------|------|
| clause 1, formula coordinate | `unorderedSuccessor_formula_mem` | `TableauClosed C`, `TrichStock C` — both already `Fuel.lean`'s currency |
| clause 1, label coordinate | -- | `UnorderedSuccessorLabelClosed fc L`, a **named residual** with its obligation map on its own docstring |
| clause 2 | `timeMergeClosed_identifyTime_signedUniverse` | `TimeMergeClosed L` — satisfiable, `timeMergeClosed_product` |

So of the residual's two conjuncts, **clause 2 is paid outright** and clause 1 is reduced from two
coordinates to one. That is the accounting the terminus corollary below inherits, and its docstring
states it rather than leaving a reader to infer that the terminus has become unconditional. -/

/-- **The composite.** `UniverseClosedAt fc (signedUniverse C L)` from the two stock conditions, the
label-set closure condition, and the one named residual.

Read against the residual this task started from: `UniverseClosed fc (signedUniverse C L)` is
**false** whenever the universe is nonempty (`universeClosed_nonempty_false`), so there is no
composite of that shape to be had at all. This is the repaired predicate, and its clause 2 is
genuinely discharged — `TimeMergeClosed L` is a condition on the label set that a caller picks
(every rectangle satisfies it, `timeMergeClosed_product`), not a residual.

What is **not** discharged is clause 1's label coordinate. It is carried as
`UnorderedSuccessorLabelClosed fc L` and it is refutable at some `L`
(`unorderedSuccessorLabelClosed_not_universal`). An earlier version of this paragraph added that the
one lemma which would let it be reduced further — a time-coordinate analogue of
`applyRule_emitted_world_mem` — did not exist in the development. It exists now
(`applyRule_emitted_time_dichotomy`, section D1), and section C11 spends it: the reduction to the
branch-side rectangle `FreshLabelHeadroom` is complete, and the residual survives it anyway because
`freshLabelHeadroom_not_universal` refutes that rectangle at every nonempty finite `L`. So this
hypothesis is not waiting on a lemma. Its obligation map is on
`UnorderedSuccessorLabelClosed`'s docstring; register entry 21 is the verdict. -/

/-- **The terminus with the closure residual paid at `signedUniverse C L`**, at the branch-length
budget — the sibling that is live, since `DifficultyBounded` is refutable at every `D`
(`difficultyBounded_multiplicity_false`).

**Precisely which residuals remain, so that nothing here is over-read.** Five hypotheses, and the
closure residual is not among them:

* `StepLengthBounded fc (signedUniverse C L) L'` — satisfiable; `difficultyBoundedAt_ceiling_at`
  reduces it further to the rule-local `StepLengthGrowth`.
* `MintPaysForTime` — the development's one genuinely open mathematical obligation, and open only
  on the **temporal** fragment. Unchanged as a declaration, and **refuted as stated at a universe of
  temporal formulas** (`mintPaysForTime_untlNeg_false`, section D2) with both obvious repairs closed
  off and the residual obstruction located. Two successive repairs are landed in section D2 —
  `MintPaysForTimeStable`, itself refuted at nonempty `U` by
  `mintPaysForTimeStable_signedUniverse_false`, and `MintPaysForTimeFixed`, which is not — each with
  its direction lemma and its own restated terminus chain. Section D3 then **discharges the
  hypothesis outright** at every `untl`/`snce`-free universe
  (`mintPaysForTimeFixed_signedUniverse_untlSnceFree`), so on that fragment this bullet names one
  residual fewer and the terminus is
  `buildTableauAt_isSome_at_seed_lengthBudget_signedUniverse_untlSnceFree`. See its own docstring.
* `PostBlockingSettles` — unchanged.
* `β ≥ 3` — the measured split arity.
* `UnorderedSuccessorLabelClosed fc L` — **the residue of this task**: clause 1's label coordinate,
  and only that coordinate. Its obligation map is on its own docstring. It is not waiting on a
  lemma: section C11 reduces it, with both coordinates fully accounted for, to the branch-side
  rectangle `FreshLabelHeadroom`, and `freshLabelHeadroom_not_universal` refutes that rectangle at
  every nonempty finite `L`. Register entry 21 records why the reduction is complete without being a
  discharge.

What is **gone** relative to `buildTableauAt_isSome_of_lengthBudget`: the whole of clause 2, and
clause 1's formula coordinate. Clause 2's payment is the substantive one — as stated it was
unsatisfiable at every nonempty universe, and it is now a rectangle condition on the label set. -/

/-! ## D1. The time coordinate: the minting census

The world coordinate is complete (`applyRule_emitted_world_dichotomy`). This section builds the
same accounting in the **time** coordinate, and the first thing it needs is the list of rules that
can put a formula at a time the branch does not already know. The section notes above record that
no statement in the development says what that list is. This is that statement.

**`ruleMintsFreshLabel` is the wrong list, in both directions.** It is a list of *witness-guarded*
rules — the ones `findApplicableRule` gates on `witnessPresent` — and witness-guardedness and
time-minting are two different properties:

* `boxNeg` and `diamondPos` are in `ruleMintsFreshLabel` and mint **no time**. Both emit at
  `Branch.nextWorld` while carrying the trigger's own time (their witness) or a branch formula's own
  time (their `boxPosFormulas` / `diamondNegFormulas` propagation blocks). Fresh *world*, known time.
* `densityRule` mints a time and is deliberately **absent** from `ruleMintsFreshLabel`: it carries
  its own `existingIntermediates`-style gap guard (the maximal-target filter on
  `TimeOrdering.futureOf`) instead of a witness test, so re-guarding it would have been redundant.
* the ACTIVE arms of `untlNeg` and `snceNeg` mint `Branch.nextTime` and are absent from
  `ruleMintsFreshLabel` too, because they are `ruleSelfGuarded`: they filter their target times
  through their own `unprocessed` test and re-include the trigger in every arm.

So neither list contains the other, and `freshTimeRules_incomparable_freshLabelRules` decides that
rather than asserting it. `expandOnceNoFresh` is the in-repo operational evidence for the same fact:
it runs the `ruleMintsFreshLabel` test **and then**, separately, a
`newOrd.constraints.length > timeOrd.constraints.length` test. Two tests in sequence are necessary
only when neither subsumes the other — a single test would do if one list contained the other.

**The census is read off `applyRule`, not guessed from the sibling list.** Every fresh time in
`applyRule` is `branch.nextTime`, bound at exactly nine sites: the `allFutureNeg` / `allPastNeg` /
`someFuturePos` / `somePastPos` / `untlPos` / `sncePos` arms, the ACTIVE arms of `untlNeg` /
`snceNeg`, and `densityRule`'s interpolation site. There is no `nextTime + k` anywhere, which is why
the dichotomy below has the same two-case shape as its world twin. -/

/-- **The nine rules that can emit at a time outside `Branch.knownTimes`.**

Derived by walking `applyRule`'s thirty-six constructor arms and recording which reach a
`freshTime := branch.nextTime` binding. Deliberately *not* derived from `ruleMintsFreshLabel`: see
the section note above for why the two lists are incomparable. -/

/-- There are exactly nine, decided rather than counted by hand. -/
theorem freshTimeRules_card : freshTimeRules.card = 9 := by decide

/-- **The two rule lists are incomparable, not nested.** Both directions, decided.

The first two conjuncts are the world-minting-is-not-time-minting direction: `boxNeg` and
`diamondPos` are witness-guarded and mint no time. The last three are the converse: `densityRule`
(gap-guarded) and the `untlNeg` / `snceNeg` ACTIVE arms (`ruleSelfGuarded`) mint a time while
sitting outside `freshLabelRules`.

`expandOnceNoFresh` is the operational evidence: it tests `ruleMintsFreshLabel` and **then** tests
`newOrd.constraints.length`, two tests in sequence, which is only necessary because neither list
subsumes the other. A reader who reads "not in `ruleMintsFreshLabel`" as "introduces no time" is
re-attempting a refuted statement — see the register entry. -/

/-! ### The time-coordinate plumbing

The closers the time sweep is built from, one per emission shape `applyRule` uses. Three are
mirrors of the world sweep's helpers (`mem_filterMap_world`, `mem_filterMap_const_world`,
`mem_boxDiamondPersistence_label`); the rest have no world counterpart, and the reason each is
needed is worth stating because it is exactly the asymmetry between the two coordinates.

**The time coordinate needs an ordering hypothesis and the world coordinate does not.** Four rules —
`allFuturePos`, `allPastPos`, `someFutureNeg`, `somePastNeg` — propagate to *every* time in
`TimeOrdering.futureOf` / `pastOf` of the trigger. Nothing about `applyRule` ties those times to the
branch: a formula may be emitted at an ordering time the branch has never carried. Their world
counterparts have no such freedom, because all four emit at `l.world`. This is why
`applyRule_emitted_time_mem` below carries `OrdTimesKnown b ord` where its world twin carries
nothing, and `applyRule_emitted_time_mem_ordTimesKnown_needed` is the witness that the hypothesis is
not removable. `mem_knownTimes_of_mem_futureOf` / `_pastOf` are the bridge, and they are exactly the
reason section A7's strengthened invariant exists.

**Identification rewrites times; it does not rewrite worlds.** `mem_identifyTime_world` concludes
`∈ b.worldFinset` outright. Its time analogue cannot: `Branch.identifyTime src tgt` moves everything
at `src` to `tgt`, and `tgt` is an arbitrary parameter of the function. So `mem_identifyTime_time`
states the honest disjunction, and `mem_identifyTime_time_at_trigger` collapses it at the only place
the engine calls it — where `tgt` is the `t₁` of `firstIncomparablePair`, already a known time. An
unconditional `∈ b.knownTimes` conclusion is not available and must not be attempted. -/

/-- A backward path of at least one edge has a last edge, so its endpoint is some constraint's
*source*. The past-directed mirror of `exists_constraint_to_of_pathN`. -/

/-! #### The `boxDiamondPersistence` time component is *not* a standalone declaration

The plan for this section called for a `mem_boxDiamondPersistence_time` beside its five siblings,
projected from `mem_boxDiamondPersistence_label`. It cannot be one: `boxDiamondPersistence` is
`private` to `Tableau.lean`, so no statement outside that module can *mention* it, and a lemma
whose hypothesis is `g ∈ boxDiamondPersistence branch w t ft` is unstateable here. What is available
is the projection *applied to a hypothesis already in scope* — `(mem_boxDiamondPersistence_label
hg).1` rewrites `g.label` to `{ world := w, time := ft }`, from which the time component follows —
and that is how the per-rule `nextTime` pinning lemmas below use it, exactly as
`applyRule_emitted_world_mem` uses it in the world coordinate.

This is register entry 9's observation in the one direction where it bites: `private` blocks name
resolution, and here the *name* is what the statement needs. It does not block unfolding, so nothing
is lost at the point of use. No `boxDiamondPersistence` block occurs in any rule the sweep below
covers — all eight rules carrying one are in `freshTimeRules` — so the sweep never needs it. -/

/-- **Identification, honestly.** Everything on `b.identifyTime src tgt` sits either at the merge
target or at a time the branch already knew.

This is where the time coordinate departs from `mem_identifyTime_world`, deliberately and
irreducibly: the world lemma concludes `∈ b.worldFinset` because identification never touches a
world, whereas here `tgt` is an arbitrary parameter and everything at `src` is moved onto it. An
unconditional `∈ b.knownTimes` conclusion is therefore false as stated — take `tgt` outside
`b.knownTimes` and any nonempty branch carrying `src`. The disjunction is collapsed at the engine's
own call site by `mem_identifyTime_time_at_trigger`; it must not be collapsed here. -/
theorem mem_identifyTime_time {b : Branch} {src tgt : TimeIndex} {g : SignedFormula}

/-- **The disjunction collapses at the trigger.** `applyRule .timeLinearity` identifies `t₂` into
`t₁` where `(t₁, t₂)` is `firstIncomparablePair b ord`, and `firstIncomparablePair_spec` already
returns `t₁ ∈ b.knownTimes`. So at the engine's own identification site — the only site there is —
the honest disjunction of `mem_identifyTime_time` closes to plain membership.

This is the same bridge move `universeClosedAt_identify_at_trigger` makes for the closure repair:
the restriction that looks like a new obligation is already discharged by the pick. -/

/-! ### `applyRule_emitted_time_mem`: the time analogue of the world sweep

Three docstrings in this file say the same thing — `MintPaysForTime`'s own, the section note
preceding `applyRule_emitted_world_dichotomy`, and `UnorderedSuccessorLabelClosed`'s obligation
map: *there is no `applyRule_emitted_time_mem`, no statement bounding the times a rule emits at by
`b.knownTimes` with the time-minting rules separated out.* This is that statement.

**Which arm falls to which closer.** The twenty-seven non-minting constructors split five ways:

* *The trigger's own time.* The propositional rules (`andPos` … `negNeg`), the modal-temporal
  bridge `boxTemporal`, the discrete rules `priorUZ` / `priorSZ` / `z1Rule`, the Dedekind rules
  `priorUGap` / `priorSGap` / `sepRule`, `serialityRule`, and `denseIndicatorClosure` all emit at
  `l` itself. Closed by `mem_knownTimes_of_mem hsf`.
* *A constant time carried across a world change.* `boxPos` / `diamondNeg` propagate to
  `b.knownWorlds` at the trigger's time; `boxNeg` / `diamondPos` mint a fresh *world* and carry the
  trigger's time onto it. Closed by `mem_filterMap_const_time_mem` — note the source list ranges
  over worlds, which is why `mem_filterMap_const_time` was stated generically in the element type.
* *A branch formula's own time.* `boxNeg` / `diamondPos`'s `boxPosFormulas` / `diamondNegFormulas`
  auto-propagation blocks relabel branch formulas to the fresh world while keeping their times.
  Closed by `mem_filterMap_time`.
* *An ordering time.* `allFuturePos` / `allPastPos` / `someFutureNeg` / `somePastNeg` propagate to
  every time in `TimeOrdering.futureOf` / `pastOf` of the trigger. Closed by
  `mem_filterMap_futureOf_time` / `mem_filterMap_pastOf_time` — **and only under
  `OrdTimesKnown b ord`**, which is why this theorem carries a hypothesis its world twin does not.
  `applyRule_emitted_time_mem_ordTimesKnown_needed` decides that the hypothesis is not removable.
* *The identification arm.* `timeLinearity` returns whole branches: arms 1 and 2 hand back `b`
  unchanged, arm 3 hands back `b.identifyTime t₂ t₁`. Closed by `mem_knownTimes_of_mem` and
  `mem_identifyTime_time_at_trigger` respectively — the pre-declared fallback of excluding
  `timeLinearity` by hypothesis was **not** needed, because `firstIncomparablePair_spec` already
  discharges the merge target.

`orderTrichotomy` is the one arm that gets its own lemma rather than a line in the sweep: it emits
at the *common predecessor* `t₀`, which is not the trigger's time and reaches the branch only
through the candidate list's `ord.pastOf` source. Extracting that needs a `find?`-to-membership
step the sweep's `first` chain cannot perform by unification alone. -/

/-- `mem_filterMap_const_time` composed with membership of the constant. Stated separately rather
than inlined because the sweep below must run entirely in tactic mode: a term-level `by` block
inside a `first` alternative elaborates with error recovery, so a *failing* side goal would be
silently filled with `sorryAx` and the alternative would appear to succeed. Every closer in the
sweep is therefore a `refine … ?_` whose failure is a real, backtrackable failure. -/

/-- **The time-dimension analogue of `applyRule_emitted_world_mem`.** A rule outside the minting
census emits only at times the branch already knows.

The exclusion is carried as `ruleMintsFreshTime rule = false` rather than as a chain of
`rule ≠ …` inequalities: the census is nine rules wide where the world lemma's was two, and the
`Bool` form keeps this signature stable if the census is ever re-derived. `mem_freshTimeRules`
is what ties the `Bool` back to the `Finset`.

**`OrdTimesKnown b ord` is a genuine hypothesis, not a convenience.** Its world twin needs
nothing, because every non-minting rule emits at a world some branch formula already carries.
The time coordinate has no such luck: `allFuturePos` and its three siblings propagate to
`TimeOrdering.futureOf` / `pastOf`, and nothing in `applyRule` ties an ordering time to the
branch. `applyRule_emitted_time_mem_ordTimesKnown_needed` decides a configuration where dropping
the hypothesis makes the statement false. The invariant is available at every consuming site —
it is section A7's, threaded by `ordTimesKnown_expandOnceUnblocked`.

**Footnote, added later.** On the `untl`/`snce`-free fragment the hypothesis is nevertheless
avoidable — not by weakening this statement, which stays exactly as it is, but by an incomparable
one stated beside it in section D3: `applyRule_emitted_time_mem_of_untlSnceFree` trades
`OrdTimesKnown b ord` for `∀ x ∈ b, untlSnceFree x.formula = true`, because the four propagation
arms above and `.orderTrichotomy` are all shape-gated by that condition. The refutation is
untouched: what it refutes is the *unconditional* statement, and its witness branch `[T(G p)]`
carries an `untl` node. -/

The witness: one branch carrying `T(G p)` at the initial label, and an ordering asserting `0 < 5`
with nothing at time `5` on the branch. `allFuturePos` propagates `T(p)` to every time in
`ord.futureOf 0`, hence to time `5`, which `b.knownTimes = [0]` does not contain. The rule is
outside the minting census — it mints no time, it *reads* one off the ordering — so the exclusion
hypothesis is satisfied and the only thing standing between this configuration and a

/-! ### The time dichotomy, and its lift to the engine

The world coordinate is complete because `applyRule_emitted_world_dichotomy` says every emission
sits at a branch world or at `Branch.nextWorld`, with no third case. This subsection closes the
time coordinate the same way. The shape is the same because the *fact* is the same: every fresh
time in `applyRule` is `branch.nextTime`, bound at exactly nine sites, with no `nextTime + k`
anywhere.

The nine minting rules split two ways, and the split is not cosmetic:

* the **six** in `freshTimeRules ∩ freshLabelRules` are *consumable* — they do not re-include their
  trigger — so every one of their emissions is pinned to `Branch.nextTime` outright
  (`applyRule_emitted_nextTime_of_freshLabel`);
* the **three** in `freshTimeRules \ freshLabelRules` re-include the trigger in every arm
  (`untlNeg` and `snceNeg` are `ruleSelfGuarded`; `densityRule` emits alongside branch-carried
  material), so a `= Branch.nextTime` conclusion is *false* for them and the honest statement is
  the disjunction directly. That is why they get their own lemmas rather than joining the group. -/

`mem_boxDiamondPersistence_label` pins to `{ world := _, time := freshTime }`.

the two `Bool` census predicates rather than on rule names, which is what keeps it nine-and-27

/-! ## D2. `MintPaysForTime`: the verdict

**Verdict: refutable as literally stated.** `mintPaysForTime_untlNeg_false` is the witness, and it
is universally quantified in the frame class and in `Tmax`. This is the third residual on this
terminus to come out refutable rather than merely unproved, after `DifficultyBounded`
(`difficultyBounded_multiplicity_false`) and `UniverseClosed`
(`universeClosed_identify_retime_false`).

**The cause, in one line.** `untlNeg` is in `freshTimeRules` and **not** in `freshLabelRules`
(`freshTimeRules_incomparable_freshLabelRules`), so a step that fires it mints a time while moving
no pair of `mintPotential`'s index set `freshLabelRules ×ˢ U`. Disjunct 1's first conjunct then
fails because a known time was added, and disjunct 2's second conjunct fails because the potential
is unchanged — `mintTimeBudget = knownTimes.card + mintPotential` even *rises*, so disjunct 2's
first conjunct fails too. All three failures are decided at the concrete configuration below.

**Re-indexing the potential on `freshTimeRules` does not repair it**, and that is worth stating
before anyone tries. `mintPotential` filters on `witnessPresent r (σ sf) b ord = false`, and
`witnessPresent`'s match has exactly eight arms — one per `freshLabelRules` member — with
everything else falling to the catch-all `false`. `witnessPresent_eq_false_of_not_freshLabel`
decides that. So widening the index set to `freshTimeRules` adds `densityRule`, `untlNeg` and
`snceNeg` columns that are *permanently* false at every state, contributing a constant to the count
and never decreasing. The wider potential is the narrower one plus `3 * |U|`, and it moves exactly
when the narrower one does. The rule coordinate is not where the repair lives.

**Where the repair does live**, and what Phase 7 builds: disjunct 1's first conjunct is the wrong
inequality. `applyRule_emitted_time_dichotomy` says an unordered successor's times are the branch's
plus at most `Branch.nextTime` — one new time per step, never more. The satisfiable statement is
therefore `nb.knownTimes.card ≤ b.knownTimes.card + 1`, which is a *theorem*
(`knownTimes_card_le_succ_of_unorderedSuccessor`) rather than a hypothesis, leaving the ordering
rank as disjunct 1's only real content.

**The satisfiability boundary.** `mintPaysForTime_empty` holds at `U = ∅`: confinement forces
`b = []`, on which the engine reports `.saturated` and there are no unordered successors at all.
As with `UniverseClosed`, the predicate is satisfiable exactly where the terminus it guards is
vacuous — `signedUniverse C L` is empty only when `C` or `L` is.

`MintPaysForTime` itself is retained **verbatim**. Nothing in this file is withdrawn. -/

/-- **`witnessPresent` is identically `false` outside `freshLabelRules`.** Its match has eight
arms, one per witness-guarded rule, and every other `(rule, sign, formula)` triple reaches the
catch-all.

This is the fact that rules out repairing `MintPaysForTime` by widening `mintPotential`'s index
set from `freshLabelRules` to `freshTimeRules`: the three added columns — `densityRule`, `untlNeg`,
`snceNeg` — would be false at every state of every run, so they contribute `3 * |U|` to the count
and never move. See the register entry. -/

/-! ### The refuting configuration

`untlNeg`'s ACTIVE arm fires when `timeOrd.futureOf l.time` is empty while `timeOrd.timeCount` is
in `(0, 4)`. The configuration below meets that with the least machinery possible: the trigger
`F(U(e,g))` sits at time `0`, and the ordering's single constraint `1 < 2` involves neither `0` nor
anything reachable from it. Two atoms at times `1` and `2` carry those times on the branch, which
is what `OrdTimesKnown` needs; atoms fire no rule, so nothing pre-empts the trigger.

`untlNeg` is a `carrierBase` rule, so this configuration is available at **every** frame class —
the witness quantifies over `fc` and the four cases are decided separately. It also quantifies over
`Tmax`: disjunct 1 fails at its *first* conjunct, which does not mention `Tmax` at all. -/

At the configuration above the engine fires `untlNeg`'s ACTIVE arm and reports a two-arm `.split`.
On the first arm: `knownTimes` goes from `{0,1,2}` to `{0,1,2,3}`, so disjunct 1's first conjunct
`4 ≤ 3` is false; `mintPotential` is `24` before and `24` after, so disjunct 2's second conjunct
`24 < 24` is false. Both disjuncts fail and the four frame classes are decided separately.

The step is a genuine mint — it issues `Branch.nextTime` — but it is invisible to `mintPotential`
because `untlNeg` is not in `freshLabelRules`, and `witnessPresent_eq_false_of_not_freshLabel`
records that no re-indexing recovers it. -/

/-! ### The repair, attempted and BLOCKED

The repair this section was to land is **not available**, and this subsection records why with
machine-checked evidence rather than leaving the attempt undocumented. Nothing vacuous is
substituted for it.

*The rule-coordinate repair is out.* Widening `mintPotential`'s index set from `freshLabelRules` to
`freshTimeRules` adds three columns that `witnessPresent_eq_false_of_not_freshLabel` proves are
`false` at every state of every run. The wider potential is the narrower one plus `3 · |U|` and
moves exactly when it does.

*The disjunct-1 repair is out too, and this is the one that had to be tested.* The obvious
remaining narrowing is to drop disjunct 1's first conjunct — `nb.knownTimes.card ≤ b.knownTimes.card`
is exactly what a minting step falsifies, and `knownTimes_card_le_succ_of_unorderedSuccessor` shows
the true bound is one larger — leaving the ordering-rank conjunct as disjunct 1's whole content.
That does not work: `splitOrderedRank Tmax b ord` is
`b.knownTimes.card * (Tmax² + 1) + (incompPairs b ord).card`, the second summand is bounded by
`Tmax²` (`incompPairs_card_le` plus the carried time bound), and the base `Tmax² + 1` is *one more*
than that bound by construction. So one extra known time raises the rank by at least `1` no matter
what the incomparable-pair count does — `splitOrderedRank_lt_of_knownTimes_lt`. The rank conjunct
therefore fails at **every** time-minting step, not just at the refuting one, and
`mintPaysForTime_rank_repair_false` decides the weakened predicate false at the same configuration
that refuted the original.

*What is actually missing.* A fourth measure component that pays for the three self-guarded minting
rules. Each has its own termination argument, and none of them is `mintPotential`:

* `untlNeg` / `snceNeg` fire only when `ord.futureOf l.time` (resp. `pastOf`) is empty **and**
  `ord.timeCount < 4`, and their own `newOrd` makes that first test fail at the next call — the
  `ruleSelfGuarded` mechanism. The natural potential, "branch times with empty forward reach", does
  **not** decrease: the arm removes the trigger's empty future and mints a fresh time whose future
  is empty, for a net change of zero.
* `densityRule` splits each maximal unfilled gap at most once, an argument about the *gap set*,
  which mentions neither `knownTimes` nor `incompPairs` nor any `witnessPresent` count.

Composing those into one measure that also survives the identification arm is open. The
identification arm is the specific obstruction: `ord.timeCount` is the quantity `untlNeg`'s cap is
stated against, and `TimeOrdering.identifyTime` can lower it — the same `maxTime`-lowering
mechanism the time-reuse verdict above turns on.

**Status: this phase is BLOCKED, and so is the concrete-instantiation discharge that depends on
it.** What is delivered instead is the accounting the residual was blocked on
(`applyRule_emitted_time_mem`, `applyRule_emitted_time_dichotomy`,
`unorderedSuccessor_time_dichotomy`, `knownTimes_card_le_succ_of_unorderedSuccessor`), the
satisfiability verdict on the residual as stated, the time-reuse verdict, and the two refutations
below that close off the repair routes a reader would try first. `MintPaysForTime` remains a named,
open hypothesis, retained verbatim; nothing in this file assumes it.

**Since this note was written, the fourth component has been attempted and decided.** The subsection
"The fourth measure component: the self-guard discharge potential" below builds the natural
candidate — a second defect ledger over `selfGuardRules ×ˢ U`, measured against each rule's own
discharge rather than against `ord.timeCount`, and therefore immune to the two routes the register
already refutes — and `mintPaysForTimeAt_reuse_false` decides it **false**, at every frame class and
every `Tmax`. So the paragraph above is now sharper than "open": the identification arm is not only
the obstruction to composing a measure in general, it defeats this composition specifically, through
the σ-hit route of the time-reuse verdict in a weakened *time-hit* form that escapes nothing.
Register entry 17 is the standing record, and the subsection "The density residual" below records
the one coordinate the verdict leaves untouched. `MintPaysForTime` is still a named, open
hypothesis, and is still assumed by nothing.

**And since *that* note was written, the verdict has been scoped and then overturned.** The
reorientation of the ordered split's identification arm (register entry 18) removed the σ-hit
configuration from the engine path, and the subsection "The self-guard component re-gated at the
oriented arm" below re-runs the gate at the renaming the oriented arm actually produces: the
component's potential falls where it previously did not, and the repaired predicate
`MintPaysForTimeStable` — the self-guard disjunct paired with a combined-budget conjunct, under a
σ-time-stability hypothesis the engine discharges — carries the four-component measure
`budgetPotentialAt` through both step lemmas and up to the two seed-level termini. So the paragraph
above is now sharper again, in the other direction: the identification arm is no longer the
obstruction, the σ-hit obligation is discharged rather than carried, and what remains open is the
**density** coordinate alone. `mintPaysForTimeAt_reuse_false` is untouched and stays true; it is a
statement about `MintPaysForTimeAt`, whose σ is tied to nothing. Register entry 19 is the standing
record, and `MintPaysForTime` — as literally stated — is still refuted, still named, and still
assumed by nothing. -/

/-- **One extra known time strictly raises the ordered rank**, whenever the smaller time count is
within the carried bound.

The base `Tmax * Tmax + 1` in `splitOrderedRank` is one more than `incompPairs`' range, and this is
that design fact used in the direction it was built for: a *rise* in the first component cannot be
absorbed by any fall in the second, exactly as a *fall* in the first cannot be absorbed by a rise.
`splitOrderedRank_le` is the range statement it rests on. -/

/-- **Dropping disjunct 1's cardinality conjunct does not repair `MintPaysForTime`.**

The weakened predicate is spelled out inline rather than given a name, because a repaired predicate
that is itself false must not be landed as a definition for a later reader to pick up. It is
`MintPaysForTime` with disjunct 1's first conjunct removed — the narrowing the satisfiability
verdict pointed at — and it is false at the *same* configuration, at every frame class, for every
`Tmax ≥ 3`.

The `3` is not arbitrary: it is the witness branch's time count, and the hypothesis is exactly what
`splitOrderedRank_lt_of_knownTimes_lt` needs. Any `Tmax` too small to bound the witness's own times
is one the terminus could not have been instantiated at. -/

/-! ### Verdict on the time-reuse sub-question

**Verdict: reuse is possible.** Decided, at a configuration the engine itself drives.

*The obligation, restated precisely.* `mintPotential_lt_of_mint` asks that the minting pair be
**σ-hit**: the formula the rule fires on must be `σ sf` for some `sf ∈ U`, where `σ` is the
composition of the `rhoSF`s of the ordered splits taken so far. `rhoSF src tgt` never lands on
`src` (`rhoSF_time_ne_src`), so σ's image omits exactly the times earlier identifications merged
away. The obligation is therefore: *a minting formula does not sit at a merged-away time.*

*The affirmative direction fails.* The available facts about identification are
`src_not_mem_knownTimes_identifyTime` (the retired time leaves `knownTimes`) and
`knownTimes_card_lt_identifyTime` (the count strictly drops). Neither says anything about
`Branch.maxTime`, and `Branch.nextTime` is `maxTime + 1`. When the retired time is the branch's
largest, `maxTime` drops with it and the next fresh time lands *back on the retired value*.
`nextTime_reissues_retired_time` decides exactly that: `firstIncomparablePair` selects `(0, 2)` on
a three-time branch, `2` leaves `knownTimes`, and the post-identification `nextTime` is `2` again.

*And the engine drives it.* `reuse_driven_through_engine` decides that two `expandOnceUnblocked`
steps after the identification, the branch carries time `2` once more. So this is not a
configuration reachable only by hand-assembling a `Branch`; it is on a run.

*The consequence for the measure.* `mint_not_in_rhoSF_image` is the σ-hit failure stated directly:
a formula minted at `b.nextTime`, when that value is the retired `src`, is in the image of no
`rhoSF src tgt`. The hypothesis of `mintPotential_lt_of_mint` is therefore not discharged — it is
**false** at this step — and Phase 7's repair must carry it structurally rather than discharge it.

*The live-times reformulation carries the identical obligation, verified rather than asserted.*
That reformulation filters additionally on the formula's time being a fixed point of `σ`. But
`rho_src_ne_src` says `src` is not a fixed point of `rho src tgt`, and the re-issued time **is**
`src`. So the extra filter excludes the re-minted formula for precisely the reason the image
condition does, and defeating one defeats the other. The obstruction is intrinsic to
identification-plus-`maxTime`, not to this measure's shape. -/

  simp [rho, h]

/-- **`rhoSF src tgt`'s image omits the time `src` entirely.** Everything at `src` is moved to
`tgt`, and everything else keeps a time that was not `src` to begin with. This is why σ's image
omits exactly the merged-away times. -/

/-- **The σ-hit failure, stated directly.** If the branch's next fresh time *is* the time an
earlier identification retired, then nothing the rule mints there lies in the renaming's image —
so `mintPotential_lt_of_mint`'s hypothesis is false, not merely unproved, at that step. -/

/-- **The retired time comes back.** `firstIncomparablePair` selects `(0, 2)` here, so the
identification arm merges the branch's *largest* time away; `Branch.maxTime` drops from `2` to `1`
and `Branch.nextTime` becomes `2` — the value just retired.

All six conjuncts are decided. The first three establish that this is a genuine ordered-split
trigger meeting both standing hypotheses, so the coincidence in the last three is attributable to
the arm rather than to a violated precondition — the same discipline
`ordTimes_identifyTime_arm3_false` uses. -/

/-- **The engine really does re-issue it.** Two `expandOnceUnblocked` steps after the
identification, time `2` is back on the branch. Decided.

This is what turns the coincidence above into a statement about *runs* rather than about
hand-assembled branches, and it is why the verdict is "reuse possible" rather than "open".

**This statement is UNCHANGED by the arm's reorientation, and that is not an oversight.** The plan
that reoriented arm 3 anticipated this `decide` flipping value and required an honest restatement
if it did. It did not flip, for a reason worth stating precisely rather than absorbing: `reuseStep`
is driven from `reuseWitnessState`, which is *hand-assembled* by a direct
`Branch.identifyTime reuseWitnessBranch 2 0` call and not by the engine's arm. What this theorem
decides is therefore conditional — *if* a run ever reaches a branch whose `maxTime` has fallen
below an index it once carried, the engine re-mints that index — and that conditional is as true
now as it was before. What the repair changes is whether the engine can *reach* such a branch:
`oriented_engine_does_not_produce_reuse` below decides that it no longer produces this one, and
`maxTime_monotone_along_run` proves it produces no other. Keeping this theorem at its original
value and adding the reachability statement beside it is the accurate record; re-tuning the witness
until the number moved would have destroyed exactly the conditional worth keeping. -/
theorem reuse_driven_through_engine :
    ((reuseStep reuseWitnessState).bind reuseStep).map
      (fun s => s.1.knownTimes.contains 2) = some true := by decide

/-- **…and the engine no longer produces the state it is conditional on.** The measurement
`reuse_driven_through_engine` cannot make, decided at the same witness.

`reuseWitnessState` is what arm 3 *used to* hand back here. Conjuncts 4 and 5 record that state's
numbers — `maxTime` fallen to `1`, `nextTime` back down to `2`, the retired index — and conjuncts 2
and 3 record what the arm now hands back instead: `maxTime` still `2`, `nextTime` `3`. Conjunct 1
pins the trigger, so the comparison is at the pair the engine itself selects rather than at a pair
chosen to make it come out right; the arm's `min 0 2` / `max 0 2` are written unevaluated for the
same reason, so the statement is read at the arm's own form. Conjunct 6 drives one further engine
step and finds `nextTime` still at `3`: nothing along the continuation recovers the retired value.

Together with `reuse_driven_through_engine` this is the whole of the repair at this witness: the
implication is untouched, and its antecedent is now unreachable. -/

/-! ### The fourth measure component: the self-guard discharge potential

The component the blocked-repair note above says is missing: a potential paying for the
**self-guarded** minting rules, measured against each rule's own discharge rather than against its
cap. `untlNeg` and `snceNeg` fire only when the trigger's forward (resp. backward) reach is empty,
and each arm's own `newOrd` makes that test fail at the next call. That is a defect ledger with its
own defect notion — deliberately *not* a widening of `mintPotential`'s, which is what closes it off
from the two routes the register already refutes. It is stated against `ord.futureOf` / `ord.pastOf`
emptiness and never against `ord.timeCount`, the quantity `TimeOrdering.identifyTime` lowers.

The subsection opens with a refute-first gate on the one exposure the design inherits and cannot
argue away in advance: the σ-hit obligation. -/

/-- **The two self-guarded time-minting rules**, as a `Finset`, so the potential's index set is a
product in the shape `mintPotential` already uses.

This is deliberately **not** `freshTimeRules` and **not** a widening of `freshLabelRules`. Widening
`mintPotential`'s index set to `freshTimeRules` is the route the do-not-re-attempt register closes
with `witnessPresent_eq_false_of_not_freshLabel`: the added columns are permanently `false`, so the
wider potential is the narrower one plus a constant. This index set carries a **different** cured/
uncured predicate (`selfGuardDischarged`, below), so it is a second ledger rather than a wider
first one.

`densityRule` is excluded on purpose. Its termination argument is about the *gap set*, is quadratic
in `|U|`, and is gated on `denseRules`; it is the right second component and is a named residual,
not a member of this list. -/
def selfGuardRules : Finset TableauRule :=
  {TableauRule.untlNeg, TableauRule.snceNeg}

/-- There are exactly two, decided rather than counted by hand. -/
theorem selfGuardRules_card : selfGuardRules.card = 2 := by decide

/-- **The self-guard's own discharge test**, transcribed from each rule's own firing guard in
inverted polarity.

`untlNeg`'s ACTIVE arm fires only when `timeOrd.futureOf l.time` is empty, and `snceNeg`'s only when
`timeOrd.pastOf l.time` is. So "the defect is already cured at this column" is exactly
*non*-emptiness of that reach — the rule cannot fire there again.

**The catch-all is `true`, the mirror image of `witnessPresent`'s polarity, and this is the design
decision that separates this component from the refuted re-indexing route.** A rule outside the
index set reports `true` here, so its column is permanently *cured* and contributes `0` to the
count; under `witnessPresent`'s polarity the out-of-range arms report `false` and contribute a
permanent positive constant, which is precisely why
`witnessPresent_eq_false_of_not_freshLabel` kills that route. The catch-all is unreachable from
`selfGuardPotential` anyway, since the index set's left factor is exactly the two named rules
(`mem_selfGuardRules`); the polarity choice is what makes any future widening harmless rather than
inert.

`ord.timeCount` is deliberately absent. It is the second conjunct of both arms' guards, and it is
the quantity `TimeOrdering.identifyTime` can lower; measuring the discharge rather than the cap is
what this component is for. -/
def selfGuardDischarged (r : TableauRule) (sf : SignedFormula) (ord : TimeOrdering) : Bool :=
  match r with
  | .untlNeg => !(ord.futureOf sf.label.time).isEmpty
  | .snceNeg => !(ord.pastOf sf.label.time).isEmpty
  | _ => true

/-- **The self-guard potential**: the number of `(rule, formula)` pairs drawn from the fixed index
set `selfGuardRules ×ˢ U` whose self-guard is **not** yet discharged, with the formula carried
through the accumulated renaming `σ`.

It deliberately does **not** take a `Branch`. The self-guard is a property of the ordering alone,
so the branch-growth half of `mintPotential`'s monotonicity has no analogue here and no branch-side
hypothesis is needed at any call site.

`σ` is the composition of the `rhoSF`s of the ordered splits taken so far, exactly as in
`mintPotential`; carrying it keeps the index set fixed across the whole run. -/
def selfGuardPotential (U : Finset SignedFormula) (σ : SignedFormula → SignedFormula)
    (ord : TimeOrdering) : Nat :=
  ((selfGuardRules ×ˢ U).filter (fun p => selfGuardDischarged p.1 (σ p.2) ord = false)).card

/-- **The repaired time-minting residual**: `MintPaysForTime`'s body verbatim, with a **third**
disjunct added and nothing removed.

Nothing is dropped, so the implication runs `MintPaysForTime → MintPaysForTimeAt` and never the
other way; the converse is refuted by `mintPaysForTime_untlNeg_false` at a `U` where the weaker
form was intended to hold. This is the `universeClosedAt_of_universeClosed` idiom.

The third disjunct is the self-guard coordinate: a self-guarded minting step is paid for by
discharging its own guard, which is invisible to both existing disjuncts — the mint raises
`knownTimes` (killing disjunct 1's first conjunct) and `untlNeg` / `snceNeg` are not in
`freshLabelRules` (so `mintPotential` does not move at all).

**Verdict on this predicate at the σ-hit hazard: see `mintPaysForTimeAt_reuse_false` below. It is
false there, for the same reason `MintPaysForTime`'s second disjunct is.** The definition is landed
anyway, and named, because the refutation has to be *stated about something*; it is not offered as
a working repair.

**Obligation map — the density coordinate is a second, independent gap.** Even setting the σ-hit
verdict aside, this predicate carrying only the `selfGuardPotential` disjunct is separately
refutable at `.Dense` / `.RTime` by a `densityRule` vehicle: `densityRule` returns `.persistent`
(`Tableau.lean:1385`), which `expandOnceUnblocked` maps to `.extended` (`MintBound.lean:1071`), so
it is inside this predicate's scope, and it mints a fresh time while lying outside **both**
`freshLabelRules` and `selfGuardRules` — no disjunct moves at all. The intended component is
`gapPotential`, indexed by `U ×ˢ U` and gated on `denseRules`; it is a **named residual**,
implemented nowhere and assumed by nothing. See the subsection "The density residual" following
`mintPaysForTimeAt_reuse_false`, and register entry 17. -/

/-! #### The gate: the σ-hit obligation, inherited in weakened form and still false

The time-reuse verdict decides that σ's image omits the times earlier identifications merged away,
and that the engine re-issues exactly those times. `mintPotential_lt_of_mint` needs the minting
formula to be **σ-hit** — literally `σ sf` for some `sf ∈ U` — and `mint_not_in_rhoSF_image`
refutes that at the re-issue configuration.

`selfGuardPotential` inherits the obligation in a *weaker* form. Its columns are indexed by the
σ-image's **time**, not by the σ-image formula, so it needs only a *time* hit: some `sf ∈ U` with
`(σ sf).label.time` equal to the trigger's time. The question this gate decides is whether that
weakening escapes the refutation.

**It does not, and the reason is one line.** `rhoSF_time_ne_src` is already a statement about
*times*: `(rhoSF src tgt sf).label.time ≠ src`, for every `sf` whatsoever. The formula-hit
refutation was derived from it (`mint_not_in_rhoSF_image` is three lines on top of it), so the

/-- **No column of `selfGuardPotential`'s index set is indexed at a retired time.**

The general half of the gate, and the reason the concrete configuration below is not a lucky
choice. The ACTIVE arm of `untlNeg` cures its trigger's column by adding `(l.time, freshTime)` to
the ordering, so the only column that arm can flip is the one at `l.time`. When `l.time` is a time
an earlier identification retired — which the time-reuse verdict decides the engine re-issues —
`rhoSF_time_ne_src` says no column lives there at all. Nothing flips, so nothing drops.

This is `mint_not_in_rhoSF_image`'s obligation stated one level weaker and still unmet: weakening
a formula hit to a time hit gains nothing, because the refutation was a time-level fact to begin
with. -/

oriented arm and the unoriented one are *literally the same list* at this configuration. Nothing at
the gate is evidence for the mechanism, and nothing at the gate regresses under it — which is why
the reuse witness, where the two orientations genuinely differ, is the configuration that carries

/-- **VERDICT: `MintPaysForTimeAt` is FALSE.** At every frame class and every `Tmax`, at the
configuration the time-reuse verdict identifies as the σ-hit hazard, with the most favorable
run-realizable renaming.

*The verdict in words.* The self-guard discharge potential does **not** repair the time-minting
residual. The σ-hit obligation that the time-reuse verdict decides false for `mintPotential` is
inherited by `selfGuardPotential` in a weakened *time-hit* form, and **the weakening does not
escape it.** `mint_not_in_rhoSF_image` is a corollary of `rhoSF_time_ne_src`, which is already a
statement about times, so relaxing "the minting formula is `σ sf`" to "the minting formula's *time*
is `(σ sf)`'s time" relaxes nothing that the refutation depended on.

*How all three disjuncts fail here.* The step mints time `3`, so `knownTimes` goes from `3` to `4`
and disjunct 1's first conjunct `4 ≤ 3` is false. `mintTimeBudget` goes from `27` to `28` and
`mintPotential` is `24` both before and after — `untlNeg` is not in `freshLabelRules` — so both of
disjunct 2's conjuncts are false. And `selfGuardPotential` is `3` both before and after, so
disjunct 3's `3 < 3` is false.

*Why this is a real refutation and not a measurement artifact.* Three things are established
separately rather than assumed. `gate_is_reissue_hazard` decides all seven preconditions, so the
failure is attributable to the arm and not to a violated hypothesis.
`selfGuardPotential_lt_at_gate_with_id` decides that the component **does** drop at this very step
under `σ = id`, so the component is not inert and the failure is located precisely at σ.
And `selfGuard_no_column_at_retired_time` gives the general reason — no configuration escapes it,
because the obstruction is the renaming's image omitting the retired time, which holds for every
`U`, every trigger and every retired time.

*Consequence.* The self-guard coordinate is not the missing fourth measure component, and the
obstruction is not this component's shape: it is intrinsic to identification-plus-`maxTime`, the
same conclusion the live-times reformulation reaches. See register entry 17. -/

/-! #### The density residual: `gapPotential`, unattempted rather than refuted

Recorded immediately after the verdict because the verdict closes the **self-guard** coordinate and
would otherwise leave a reader believing the whole fourth-component question closed with it. It is
not. This subsection states precisely which coordinate remains, why it is a separate clause rather
than another disjunct fitted to the same ledger, and that nothing here is implemented or assumed.

*The exposure the verdict does not cover.* `MintPaysForTimeAt` carrying only the
`selfGuardPotential` disjunct is separately refutable at `.Dense` / `.RTime` by a `densityRule`
vehicle, on grounds that have nothing to do with the σ-hit hazard. `densityRule` is inside the
predicate's scope — it returns `.persistent` (`Tableau.lean:1385`), which `expandOnceUnblocked` maps
to `.extended` (`MintBound.lean:1071`) — and it mints a fresh time while sitting outside **both**
`freshLabelRules` and `selfGuardRules`. So a `densityRule` step moves no disjunct of the predicate
at all, at any `U`, independently of everything above. `freshTimeRules_incomparable_freshLabelRules`
is the census fact that puts it outside the first list; `selfGuardRules` excludes it by construction.

*The intended component, named so that its absence is legible.* `gapPotential`, indexed by `U ×ˢ U`
rather than by `selfGuardRules ×ˢ U`. The index shape is forced by the rule's own argument:
`densityRule` splits each *maximal unfilled gap* at most once, and a gap is a **pair**, so the
ledger transcribes the rule's own `gapTargets` filter (`Tableau.lean:1364-1366`) —
`(timeOrd.futureOf t').isEmpty`, together with `t'` lying below no other future time of the trigger
— rather than any per-rule discharge test. It is therefore quadratic in `|U|` where
`selfGuardPotential` is linear, and it is gated on `denseRules` (`Tableau.lean:1593`), so it
contributes nothing at `.Base` / `.ZTime`.

*That it has to be a separate clause is not this development's invention.* In the mosaic
decidability argument whose residual structure this file follows, density is `(SVDns)`, listed among
the *additional vertical saturation conditions* and kept apart from the eventuality conditions the
other clauses discharge (Caleiro–Viganò–Volpe 2013, §3.1). The separation is the source's. The
pair-indexing conclusion is independently forced by `densityRule`'s own docstring in any case, so
nothing here rests on the citation alone.

**Nothing of `gapPotential` is implemented in this file, and no theorem in this file assumes it.**
It is named so that a reader arriving at the verdict above can tell which coordinate is *refuted*
and which is merely *untried*; see register entry 17. Refuting the self-guard coordinate says
nothing about this one in either direction. -/

/-! ### Monotone time issuance: the identification-side gate

**VERDICT: TRUE.** The mechanism prevents the reuse, at the witness and along the engine-driven
run, and all three settled invariants survive it. Phases 2-9 of the repair are unlocked by this
subsection; nothing below it is assumed anywhere above.

*What the gate is deciding.* Entry 15 records that the ordered split's identification arm can
retire the branch's **largest** time, dropping `Branch.maxTime` and making `Branch.nextTime`
re-issue the value just retired. The arm calls `branch.identifyTime t₂ t₁`, retiring `t₂` whatever
its magnitude, and `firstIncomparablePair_spec` guarantees only `t₂ ≠ t₁` — never `t₁ < t₂`. The
mechanism prototyped here **orients the merge by numeric order** instead: retire `min t₁ t₂`, keep
`max t₁ t₂`. Which numeral survives is semantically arbitrary — identification asserts the two
instants are the *same*, and nothing in the semantics reads the numeral's magnitude — so the
orientation is free, and it is exactly what makes `maxTime` non-decreasing at the arm.

*Why this is a gate and not the repair.* Everything here is **additive** and calls the existing,
byte-unchanged `Branch.identifyTime` / `TimeOrdering.identifyTime`. No engine file is touched by
this subsection. That constraint is not stylistic: `Verified/Decidable.lean` carries 102
`Branch.nextTime` references — `lt_nextTime_of_mem_knownTimes`, `OrdWithin.bound` and
`OrdWithin.nextTime_not_mem` among them — which consume `nextTime = maxTime + 1` *definitionally*.
Redefining the bookkeeping would break all of them; reorienting the call site breaks none.

*The measured contrast, which is what makes the verdict attributable to the mechanism.* Along the
same two engine steps from the same witness:

| | `maxTime` trajectory | retired index | re-issued? |
|---|---|---|---|
| current arm (`identifyTime t₂ t₁`) | `2 → 1 → 1 → 2` | `2` | **yes** (`reuse_driven_through_engine`) |
| oriented arm (`identifyTime (min) (max)`) | `2 → 2 → 2 → 3` | `0` | **no** |

`oriented_arm_is_not_inert` decides both rows side by side. Without that pairing the gate could not
distinguish "the mechanism prevents the reuse" from "the configuration stopped applying" — the same
discriminating discipline `selfGuardPotential_lt_at_gate_with_id` sets for the refuted
fourth-component route.

*Ladder rung used.* Candidate A (merge orientation) only. The two fallback rungs — a `horizon`
field on `TimeOrdering`, and a run-level mint counter threaded through `applyRule` — were not
prototyped, because the first rung decided the gate. Their measured costs (29 files and 82 literal
sites; two engine signatures plus `Saturation.lean`) are recorded here so a reader who needs them
does not have to re-measure. -/

/-- **The orientation, as a pure function on the trigger's pair.** `(retired, surviving)`: the
numeral that disappears is the smaller, the numeral that survives is the larger.

That single choice is the whole mechanism. `Branch.identifyTime src tgt` relabels everything at
`src` to sit at `tgt` and leaves every other time alone, so the post-arm branch's times are the
pre-arm branch's times minus `src`. If `src` is the smaller of a pair both of whose members are
known times, it cannot have been the branch's maximum — the larger member is a known time too, and
they are distinct — so nothing the branch loses can lower `Branch.maxTime`, and `Branch.nextTime`,
being `maxTime + 1` by definition, cannot fall either. -/
def identifyOrient (t₁ t₂ : TimeIndex) : TimeIndex × TimeIndex := (min t₁ t₂, max t₁ t₂)

/-- **The prototype arm-3 successor.** The ordered split's identification arm as it would read
under the orientation, assembled here without touching `Tableau.lean`.

It calls the **existing, unmodified** `Branch.identifyTime` and `TimeOrdering.identifyTime` — no
new field, no new signature, no threaded counter. Demonstrating that the mechanism needs nothing
but a swap of two arguments at one call site is the point of stating it this way, and it is the
constraint the whole repair rests on. -/

/-- **Question (a) at the witness: the oriented arm does not re-issue.** Decided at
`reuseWitnessBranch` / `reuseWitnessOrd` with the pair `(0, 2)` that `firstIncomparablePair`
actually selects there (`gate_is_reissue_hazard` conjunct 3), so the measurement is at the
configuration entry 15 is about and not at a configuration chosen to make it come out right.

Three conjuncts. Time `2` is a known time; the post-arm `nextTime` is strictly above it, so `2`
cannot be minted next; and `Branch.maxTime` did not fall across the arm — which is the property
that generalises, and the one Phase 2 lifts off this configuration. -/

/-- **Question (a) driven through the engine: the retired index does not come back.** The direct
counterpart of `reuse_driven_through_engine`, and the conjunct that makes the verdict a statement
about *runs* rather than about a hand-assembled `Branch`.

Under the orientation the index the arm retires is `0`, not `2`. Two `expandOnceUnblocked` steps
later it is still absent from `knownTimes`, and `Branch.maxTime` has gone `2 → 2 → 3` rather than
`2 → 1 → 2`. Reuse is not merely unobserved here: `Branch.nextTime` is `maxTime + 1` and `maxTime`
never fell, so every mint along this run is at a value strictly above every index the run has ever
retired.

A gate that checked only `oriented_arm_does_not_reissue` would be checking the arm in isolation.
This is the conjunct that checks the mechanism where entry 15 does its damage. -/

/-- **The discriminating measurement.** At the *same* witness, the *current* orientation re-issues
and the oriented one does not — decided side by side, in one statement, so the verdict cannot be an
artifact of the configuration having stopped applying.

Conjuncts 1 and 3 restate what `nextTime_reissues_retired_time` and `reuse_driven_through_engine`
already decide, at the same numbers; conjuncts 2 and 4 are their oriented counterparts. Conjuncts 5
and 6 exhibit the `maxTime` drop that causes the re-issue and its absence under the orientation, so
the mechanism is visible and not merely its consequence.

This is the pairing `selfGuardPotential_lt_at_gate_with_id` sets the precedent for: a gate that
reports only the favourable half of a comparison has measured nothing. -/

/-- **Question (b): the settled invariants survive the oriented arm.** Seven conjuncts, decided at
**both** landed witness configurations, in the discipline `gate_is_reissue_hazard` uses — without
the trigger conjuncts a negative verdict would be attributable to a violated precondition rather
than to the mechanism.

1-2. the pair each configuration's trigger actually reports, so the oriented arm below is applied
   at the pair the engine itself would hand it;
3. `RunInvariant` — hence `IrreflOrd` **and** `OrdTimesKnown`, register entries 7 and 16's settled
   repair — holds after the oriented arm at the reuse witness;
4. …and at the gate configuration;
5. the oriented merge **target** is a known time at both configurations. This is precisely
   `UniverseClosedAt` clause 2's restriction (entries 10-12), so the confinement bridge
   `universeClosedAt_identify_at_trigger` applies at the oriented arm with nothing extra assumed —
   note clause 2 already quantifies its *source* time freely, which is why the swap costs nothing
   there;
6. confinement itself, decided: the post-arm branch stays inside the retiming-closed universe;
7. **at the gate configuration the oriented arm and the current arm are the same list.** The gate's
   trigger reports `(2, 0)`, so `min = 0 = t₂` and `max = 2 = t₁`, and the orientation is already
   what the current arm does there. Nothing at the gate regresses, and nothing at the gate is
   evidence *for* the mechanism either — which is why the reuse witness, where the two orientations
   genuinely differ, carries the verdict. -/

general.** `identifyTime_no_collapse` is stated from an `incomparableB ord (t₁, t₂)` hypothesis
whose three conjuncts are written asymmetrically in `t₁` / `t₂`, so applying it at the flipped
orientation needs `incomparableB` to be symmetric in its pair.

Decided here at both witness orderings, in both directions. That is evidence, not proof: the
general `incomparableB_symm` is a named obligation of the next phase, and if it turns out to be
false in general the mechanism dies there rather than here. Recording the decided instances now
means a reader can see the obligation was identified before it was needed. -/

/-! #### Run-level monotonicity, off the gate configuration

Phase 1 decided the mechanism at two witnesses. This subsection lifts it: the same statements
quantified over every branch, every ordering and both times, plus the one citation the design rests
on turned into a checked statement.

*The one finding worth recording up front.* The general form needs **no membership hypotheses at
all**. `maxTime_le_identifyTime_of_le` asks only `src ≤ tgt`, and `min t₁ t₂ ≤ max t₁ t₂` is
unconditional, so `maxTime_le_identifyTime_oriented` holds for arbitrary times on an arbitrary
branch. The plan-time shape carried `t₁ ∈ b.knownTimes` and `t₂ ∈ b.knownTimes`; both turned out to
be unnecessary, which is a strengthening rather than a shortcut — the hypotheses reappear only in
`retired_lt_nextTime_oriented`, where the *retired* index has to be located below `b.maxTime` and
membership is genuinely what does it. -/

/-- **The mechanism in one lemma, with the orientation abstracted away.** Identifying a time into a
time at least as large never lowers `Branch.maxTime`.

Every branch formula survives the relabelling (`mem_identifyTime`), so it is enough to place each
pre-arm time under the post-arm maximum. A formula not sitting at `src` keeps its time outright; a
formula sitting at `src` moves to `tgt`, and `src ≤ tgt` is exactly what carries the bound across
that move. No membership hypothesis is used, and none is available to be used — the statement is
true on an arbitrary branch at arbitrary times.

This is the whole of Candidate A's content. Everything below is instantiation. -/

orientation is the mechanism rather than a coincidence of the witness.

Contrast `ordTimes_identifyTime_arm3_false` and `oriented_arm_is_not_inert` conjunct 5: at the
*current* orientation `Branch.maxTime` demonstrably falls. There is no hypothesis that could be
added to rescue the current arm, because the drop is what the arm does. -/

/-- **…and so is `Branch.nextTime`.** The immediate corollary, stated separately because this is
the form the nine mint sites in `Tableau.lean` consume: each of them reads `branch.nextTime`, and
none of them needs an edit once this holds, since `Branch.nextTime = Branch.maxTime + 1` is
unchanged and `Nat.succ` is monotone.

That is the payoff of the byte-unchanged-definitions constraint, stated as a theorem rather than
argued: the repair reaches all nine mint sites without touching any of them. -/

/-- **The statement that replaces the obstruction.** The index the oriented arm retires is strictly
below the branch's next fresh time *after* the arm — so it cannot be the value the next mint
issues, and register entry 15's configuration cannot arise.

Membership of both times is used here and is genuinely needed: the retired index has to be placed
under `b.maxTime` before monotonicity can carry it under the post-arm `nextTime`, and only
membership does that. `firstIncomparablePair_spec` supplies both at the engine's own trigger, so
the hypotheses cost nothing at the one call site there is.

This is the theorem C9 entry 18 cites. If a later phase fails, it fails downstream of this. -/

specification. -/

/-- **The "single non-additive step" claim, checked rather than cited.**
`Verified/Decidable.lean:274` asserts in prose that the ordered split's identification arm is the
engine's only non-additive branch step. This is that assertion as a theorem, and the enumeration
behind it is complete: `ExpansionResult` has exactly **four** constructors, and every one is
accounted for.

* `.saturated` — no successor branch at all, so `unorderedSuccessorBranches` is `[]`.
* `.extended` — one successor, of shape `fs ++ b` (`expandOnceUnblocked_extended_shape`).
* `.split` — its arms, each containing `b` (`expandOnceUnblocked_split_subset`).
* `.splitOrdered` — contributes nothing to `unorderedSuccessorBranches` by construction, and is
  covered by the second conjunct, which returns the exact three-arm list.

Conjunct 1 is `expandOnceUnblocked_branch_mono`, which was already landed and is stated at exactly
the generality the check needs; conjunct 2 is `expandOnceUnblocked_splitOrdered_shape`. Composing
them is the check: **every** successor of **every** shape either contains `b` verbatim or is one of
the three ordered-split arms, of which only the third moves a time. No second branch-shrinking arm
exists, so Phase 1's verdict about arm 3 does establish run-level monotonicity rather than a
statement about one arm.

Conjunct 2 now reads `bs = orientedSplitArms b ord t₁ t₂` on the nose. That is not a restatement
for tidiness: since the engine's arm is itself oriented, `orientedSplitArms` has stopped being a
prototype standing in for the arm and *is* the arm, so everything proved about it below is a
statement about runs the engine actually takes. -/

/-- **Run-level monotonicity of `Branch.maxTime`**, composing the shape census with the arm result:
across every successor of every shape the engine can report, the branch maximum is non-decreasing.

Conjunct 1 covers `.extended` and `.split` — the additive shapes — through
`expandOnceUnblocked_branch_mono` and `maxTime_mono`. Conjunct 2 covers the ordered split, stated
at the engine's **own** `.splitOrdered` result rather than at a hypothetical arm list: since the
live arm is the oriented one, the shape census turns any reported `bs` into `orientedSplitArms` and
`maxTime_le_orientedSplitArms` finishes. `.saturated` reports no successor and is covered by
conjunct 1 vacuously, which is absence of a successor rather than a weakening of the claim.

Together the two conjuncts exhaust the engine's step: **no successor of any shape has a smaller
`Branch.maxTime` than the branch it came from.** This is the run-level statement Phase 1's gate
decided at one configuration. -/

/-- **…and hence of fresh-time issuance itself.** `Branch.nextTime` is `Branch.maxTime + 1` by a
definition this task leaves byte-unchanged, so monotonicity of the one is monotonicity of the
other. This is the run-level form of the property register entry 15 says is unavailable — and it
*was* unavailable at the unoriented arm, which is why the repair went to the arm and not to the
measure.

**Read as a statement about reuse**: every fresh time the engine mints is `nb.maxTime + 1` for the
branch it mints on, and no branch along a run has a smaller `maxTime` than its predecessor, so
every mint is strictly above every time index the run has ever carried — including every index an
earlier identification retired. `nextTime_reissues_retired_time`'s configuration cannot recur on
the engine path; see `reuse_driven_through_engine` for the same fact decided at that witness. -/

/-! #### Invariant survival at the oriented arm, generally

The three settled repairs the register protects — `OrdTimesKnown` (entries 7 and 16), the
`UniverseClosedAt` confinement (entries 10-12), and the `.splitOrdered` measure's first component —
re-proved at the oriented arm for arbitrary branches and times, not only at the gate.

*R1 is closed, and the answer is the favourable one.* `incomparableB_symm` was the plan's single
most likely point of failure: `identifyTime_no_collapse` is stated from an `incomparableB
ord (t₁, t₂)` hypothesis written asymmetrically in `t₁` / `t₂`, and the oriented arm applies it at
the flipped pair whenever `t₁ < t₂`. The symmetry **holds**, and it reduces to the reachability
duality this development already owns — with one gap, recorded below.

*The one thing that was genuinely missing.* `orderDual_holds` (`Fuel.lean`) states the duality in
the forward direction only: `t₂ ∈ futureOf t₁ → t₁ ∈ pastOf t₂`. `incomparableB_symm` needs the
mirror as well, and the mirror was not landed anywhere. `orderDual_backward` supplies it, by the
same three-step argument at the converse step relation. That is the only declaration in this
subsection that is not an instantiation of something already proved, and recording it is the point
of the plan's "a lemma that needed an independent proof is a signal" instruction: the signal here
is small and localised — a missing mirror in a reachability calculus, not a defect in the
orientation.

*Where those two live.* `orderDual_backward` and `incomparableB_symm` are landed in section A,
alongside `incomparableB_of_firstIncomparablePair`, rather than here: the engine-facing arm-3
lemmas consume them far above this subsection, and Lean's dependency order decides the position.
Their content is this subsection's; only their location is not. -/

/-- **Collapse-freedom at the oriented arm.** `identifyTime_no_collapse` restated at
`(min t₁ t₂, max t₁ t₂)`, by a case split on which of the two times is the smaller.

When `t₂ ≤ t₁` the oriented arm *is* the current arm and the lemma applies verbatim. When
`t₁ ≤ t₂` the arguments are flipped and `incomparableB_symm` supplies the hypothesis at the flipped
pair. Both branches are direct instantiations; the case split is the whole of the new content. -/

about branch and ordering being relabelled by the same `rho`. A fact of that shape cannot notice

pair is which costs exactly the one fact `firstIncomparablePair_spec_oriented` supplies, and adds
no hypothesis. Nothing here constrains `t₂` as well as `t₁` — entry 12 decides that both-times
form is the weaker one, not the repair. -/

/-! ### The self-guard component re-gated at the oriented arm

Phase 1's gate above is a statement about the renaming the identification arm produced **at the
time that gate was built**. Arm 3 merged `t₂` into `t₁` whatever their magnitudes, so at the reuse
witness's own trigger `(0, 2)` it produced `rhoSF 2 0` — retiring the *larger* numeral — and
`gateSigma` is exactly that renaming. `identifyOrient` retires the smaller numeral instead, so at
the same trigger the arm now produces `rhoSF 0 2`, and no run produces `rhoSF 2 0` there any more.

That distinction is the whole of the σ-hit obligation, and it cuts the other way from Phase 1.
`rhoSF src tgt`'s image omits exactly `src` (`rhoSF_time_ne_src`) and fixes every other time on the
nose (`rhoSF_time_eq_of_ne_src` below), while `src_not_mem_knownTimes_identifyTime` says the
post-arm branch carries no formula at `src` at all. Under the oriented arm the renaming therefore
fixes the time of **every formula the branch still carries**, so the *time* hit `selfGuardPotential`
needs is available at every trigger the engine can select: the trigger is a branch formula, and the
branch's times are precisely the ones the renaming fixes.

**`mintPaysForTimeAt_reuse_false` is untouched by this and stays true exactly as stated.**
`MintPaysForTimeAt` quantifies `σ` with no tie to the state it is read at, so a renaming no run
produces still refutes it, and register entry 17 stands as a statement about that predicate. What
changes is that the refuting renaming is now identifiable *by a property of the state it is applied
at* rather than only by provenance: `gateSigma` moves the gate's own trigger off its own time, and
no renaming the oriented arm produces does that to a formula the branch still carries.
`SigmaTimeStable` names that property; `MintPaysForTimeStable` is `MintPaysForTimeAt` carrying it.
-/

/-- **The converse of `rhoSF_time_ne_src`: every time but the retired one is fixed on the nose.**

One line, and it is the positive half of the σ-hit story that Phase 1 had no use for. `rho src tgt`
is an `if` on `t = src`, so away from `src` it is the identity — which is why the *only* time a
single identification's renaming can fail to hit is the one it retires. -/
theorem rhoSF_time_eq_of_ne_src {src tgt : TimeIndex} {sf : SignedFormula}
    (h : sf.label.time ≠ src) : (rhoSF src tgt sf).label.time = sf.label.time := by
  simp [rhoSF, rho, h]

/-- **The converse of `selfGuard_no_column_at_retired_time`: at a live time a column *is* indexed.**

`selfGuard_no_column_at_retired_time` says no column of `selfGuardRules ×ˢ U` sits at the retired
index. This says the retired index is the *only* one missing: for any `sf ∈ U` whose time is not
`src`, the pair `(untlNeg, sf)` is a column of the index set and its σ-image sits at exactly
`sf.label.time`.

Together the two lemmas locate the obstruction precisely. It was never that the ledger is indexed
too narrowly; it was that the one time the renaming omits happened, under the unoriented arm, to be
a time the engine could re-issue and put a trigger at. -/

/-- **σ-time-stability**: the accumulated renaming moves no formula the branch still carries off
its own time.

This is the property that separates the renamings a run can produce from the ones it cannot, and it
is stated *at the state* rather than by provenance so that it can be assumed, discharged and
decided. It is deliberately weaker than "σ fixes the branch pointwise" — only times are constrained,
because only times are what `selfGuardDischarged` reads.

Note what it does **not** say. It puts no condition on `σ` away from `b`, so it does not exclude a
renaming that moves times the branch has already lost; that is exactly right, since a column at a
lost time can no longer be flipped by any rule the engine fires. -/
def SigmaTimeStable (σ : SignedFormula → SignedFormula) (b : Branch) : Prop :=
  ∀ x ∈ b, (σ x).label.time = x.label.time

/-- **The oriented arm's own renaming is σ-time-stable at the state the arm produces.**

The general reason the re-gate below comes out the other way, and it needs nothing but the two
facts either side of it: the post-arm branch carries no formula at the retired index
(`src_not_mem_knownTimes_identifyTime`), and away from that index the renaming is the identity on
times (`rhoSF_time_eq_of_ne_src`).

No membership hypothesis on `t₁` or `t₂` is used, and none is available to be used — the statement
holds on an arbitrary branch at any two distinct times. Under the unoriented arm the same proof
gives the same conclusion about `rhoSF t₂ t₁`; what the orientation buys is not this lemma but
`retired_lt_nextTime_oriented`, which is what stops the engine from ever putting a trigger back at
the retired index. -/

which is why no column of the ledger sat at the trigger's time and why disjunct 3 could not fall.
Conjunct 2 records that the oriented renaming is no better *at that branch* — `gateBranch` carries
a formula at time `0`, the index the oriented arm retires — which is the honest statement: the
Phase-1 gate is not a state the oriented arm produces at all, under either renaming. Conjunct 3 is

/-- **The repaired time-minting residual**: `MintPaysForTimeAt`'s body verbatim, with the renaming
tied to the state it is read at by one added hypothesis and nothing removed.

Two hypotheses were added to `MintPaysForTime` on the way here and both weaken the predicate, so
the implication runs `MintPaysForTime → MintPaysForTimeStable` and never the other way. This is the
`universeClosedAt_of_universeClosed` idiom. It does **not** factor through `MintPaysForTimeAt`: that
predicate's third disjunct is the bare `selfGuardPotential` drop, this one's pairs the drop with a
combined-budget conjunct, and the pairing is forced — see below.

**What the added hypothesis is for.** `MintPaysForTimeAt` is refuted as stated by
`mintPaysForTimeAt_reuse_false`, and that refutation is permanent: `σ` is quantified there with no
tie to `b`, so a renaming that moves the trigger off its own time defeats any σ-mediated ledger.
`SigmaTimeStable σ b` is the minimal statement excluding exactly that, and it is not a wish —
`sigmaTimeStable_identifyOriented` discharges it at the state the identification arm produces, with
no membership hypothesis at all.

**What it is not.** It is not a constraint on the frame class, on `U`, on `Tmax`, or on the branch;
it is a constraint on the renaming, which is the one argument of `MintPaysForTime` that no consumer
of the terminus supplies from outside. See `mintPaysForTimeStable_no_leak` below.

**Why the third disjunct is a pair.** It mirrors disjunct 2 exactly: disjunct 2 pairs a
`mintPotential` drop with a `mintTimeBudget` non-increase, and this one pairs a `selfGuardPotential`
drop with a **combined**-budget non-increase — the mint budget plus the self-guard potential. The
pairing is forced, not decorative. A self-guarded mint raises `mintTimeBudget` by one, and
`extensionAllowance` carries a factor of `|U|` per unit of mint budget, so without a cap on the
combined quantity the measure does not fall however the fourth component is weighted. The combined
form is the right one because the mint spends exactly one unit of the fourth component to buy the
one unit of mint budget it consumes: the component funds the budget rather than sitting beside it.
Measured at the oriented gate, `26 + 3 = 29` before and `27 + 1 = 28` after
(`orientedGate_disjunct3_holds`). The consequence is that `MintPaysForTimeAt`, whose third disjunct
is the bare drop, does **not** imply this predicate; see `mintPaysForTimeStable_of_mintPaysForTime`.

**The density residual is unchanged.** Everything `MintPaysForTimeAt`'s obligation map records
about `densityRule` applies here verbatim: `densityRule` mints a fresh time while lying outside
both `freshLabelRules` and `selfGuardRules`, so no disjunct moves, and the intended component
`gapPotential` remains a named residual. See the subsection "The density residual" and register
entry 17. -/

third disjuncts differ: `MintPaysForTimeAt`'s is the bare `selfGuardPotential` drop, while this
one's pairs that drop with a **combined-budget** conjunct, exactly as disjunct 2 pairs its
`mintPotential` drop with a plain budget conjunct. The pairing is not decoration — see
`budgetStateAt_of_disjunct3` — so `MintPaysForTimeAt → MintPaysForTimeStable` is unavailable and is
not claimed. Both disjuncts 1 and 2 survive verbatim, which is all this lemma needs. -/

/-! #### The oriented gate: the same measurement at the renaming the oriented arm produces

Phase 1's gate is rebuilt here at the state the *oriented* arm hands back from the same reuse
witness at the same trigger `(0, 2)`. Everything is a faithful mirror: the ordering is
`TimeOrdering.identifyTime reuseWitnessOrd 0 2` on the nose, the branch is that arm's branch with an
`untlNeg` trigger placed at the one time whose forward reach the ordering leaves empty, and the
renaming is the `rhoSF` the arm itself produces. Only the orientation differs.

The discipline is Phase 1's, unchanged. All three disjuncts are measured, not just the favourable
one; the hazard conjuncts are decided separately so a verdict cannot be attributed to a violated
precondition; and the unfavourable renaming is measured at the same step so the verdict is located
at σ rather than at the ledger's shape. -/

/-- The oriented gate's trigger. `untl` again, so the vehicle is `mintWitnessTrigger`'s and the
comparison with Phase 1 is at one moving part. It sits at time `1`, the time whose forward reach
the post-arm ordering leaves empty — `untlNeg`'s ACTIVE guard. -/
def orientedGateTrigger : SignedFormula := SignedFormula.neg (Formula.untl mwG mwE) ⟨0, 1⟩

/-- The oriented gate branch: the trigger, then the two atoms the oriented arm leaves at times `2`
and `1`. Under the orientation the retired numeral is `0`, so — unlike `gateBranch` — no formula
here sits at a retired index, which is exactly what `orientedGate_sigmaTimeStable` decides. -/
def orientedGateBranch : Branch :=
  [orientedGateTrigger, SignedFormula.pos mwP ⟨0, 2⟩, SignedFormula.pos mwQ ⟨0, 1⟩]

/-- The oriented gate ordering. It is `TimeOrdering.identifyTime reuseWitnessOrd 0 2` on the nose:
the arm substitutes `0 ↦ 2` in the single constraint `(0, 1)`, leaving `(2, 1)`. `futureOf 1` is
empty and `timeCount` is `2`, which is `untlNeg`'s ACTIVE guard. -/
def orientedGateOrd : TimeOrdering := ⟨[(2, 1)]⟩

/-- The oriented gate universe: the branch itself, so confinement is immediate — the same choice
`gateUniverse` makes. -/
def orientedGateUniverse : Finset SignedFormula :=
  {orientedGateTrigger, SignedFormula.pos mwP ⟨0, 2⟩, SignedFormula.pos mwQ ⟨0, 1⟩}

/-- The first arm of the split the ACTIVE `untlNeg` reports: `F(e)` at the freshly minted time `3`,
the re-included trigger, and the original branch. -/

  [SignedFormula.neg mwE ⟨0, 3⟩, orientedGateTrigger, orientedGateTrigger,
   SignedFormula.pos mwP ⟨0, 2⟩, SignedFormula.pos mwQ ⟨0, 1⟩]

trigger's column — and, under the oriented renaming, the column is actually there to be cured. -/
def orientedGateNewOrd : TimeOrdering := ⟨[(1, 3), (2, 1)]⟩

/-- **The renaming the oriented arm produces.** `rhoSF 0 2`, not `rhoSF 2 0`: `identifyOrient 0 2`
is `(0, 2)`, so the numeral the arm retires is `0` and the numeral that survives is `2`.

Seven conjuncts, all decided, in the discipline `gate_is_reissue_hazard` uses — and deliberately
the *same seven questions*, so the two gates can be read side by side.

1-2. the standing hypotheses hold at the oriented gate state;
3. `firstIncomparablePair` selects `(0, 2)` on the predecessor state, so the identification that
   produces `orientedGateSigma` is the one the engine itself takes;
4. the numeral the oriented arm retires is `0`, and it really is retired;
5. …and, unlike under the old orientation, it is **not** re-issued: the post-arm `nextTime` is `3`,
   strictly above the retired index. This is conjunct 5 of `gate_is_reissue_hazard` with its verdict
   reversed, and it is the whole mechanism;
6. the oriented gate ordering is exactly what that identification leaves behind;
7. the trigger sits at a live time and `untlNeg`'s ACTIVE guard is met there — empty forward reach,
   with `timeCount` inside the `(0, 4)` window. -/

`mintPotential` is `24` before and after, because `untlNeg` is not in `freshLabelRules`. Disjunct 3

potential does not move. Conjunct 2 is the oriented measurement. Conjunct 3 records that the
unoriented renaming is not inert *here* either — it also falls, `4 → 2` — so the verdict is not an
artifact of the oriented gate being an easier configuration; every renaming pays at a state whose
trigger sits at a live time.

/-- **VERDICT: the re-gate decides TRUE.** `MintPaysForTimeStable`'s body holds at the oriented
gate, at every frame class, every `Tmax` and every reported successor.

*The verdict in words.* Phase 1's FALSE verdict does **not** survive the reorientation of the
identification arm. It was a statement about `rhoSF 2 0` — the renaming the arm produced when it
merged the larger numeral away — and the arm no longer produces it at that trigger, or at any
other. At the renaming the arm now produces, the self-guard discharge potential pays for the
self-guarded minting step on its own, which is what the component was designed to do.

*What is decided here and what is not.* This is a gate, and it decides exactly what Phase 1's gate
decided, with the sign reversed: the design is not refuted at the configuration that refuted it, so
the plumbing may be built. It is **not** a proof of `MintPaysForTimeStable` at any `U` — that is the
work the plan's later phases carry, and the density residual (`gapPotential`) is untouched by it.
A reader who takes this theorem for the discharge has taken a decided instance for a quantified
statement.

*Why this does not contradict `mintPaysForTimeAt_reuse_false`.* That theorem is about
`MintPaysForTimeAt`, which quantifies `σ` with no tie to the state it is read at, and it stays true.
`MintPaysForTimeStable` carries `SigmaTimeStable σ b`, which `gateSigma_not_sigmaTimeStable` decides
false at Phase 1's gate and `orientedGate_sigmaTimeStable` decides true here, and which
`sigmaTimeStable_identifyOriented` discharges at every state the identification arm produces. The
two verdicts are about two predicates and both stand. See register entry 19. -/

/-! #### Preservation across the identification arm — Constraint (F), discharged

The crux. The ordered split's arm 3 is the one step at which the whole design has to be checked
rather than argued, because it is the step every `knownTimes.card`-affine candidate dies at: a
self-guarded mint raises the known-time count and the identification arm lowers it, so no sign of
coefficient satisfies both. `selfGuardPotential` is not affine in that count — it is not a function
of the branch at all — and what has to be shown instead is that the arm does not *raise* it.

It does not, and with room to spare: the arm's renaming is post-composed onto σ, no constraint is
dropped at an incomparable trigger (`identifyTime_no_collapse`), and reachability transports edge by
edge (`futureOf_transport` / `pastOf_transport`). So the discharged set only grows and the uncured
count only falls. **This is Constraint (F) discharged with equality-or-better**, and it is what
separates Candidate 2 from every candidate the constraint kills.

The `incomparableB ord (t₁, t₂)` side condition is not a new hypothesis. It is available at the
consuming site from `firstIncomparablePair_spec`, whose last two conjuncts are literally
`incomparableB`'s two clauses, and at the engine's own orientation from
`incomparableB_of_firstIncomparablePair_oriented`. `IrreflOrd` is likewise the run invariant's own
first conjunct — and it is *necessary*, not convenient: `witnessPresent_identifyTime_unconditional_false`
(register entry 5) refutes the `IrreflOrd`-free form for the sibling predicate, and the reason
carries over verbatim, since `TimeOrdering.identifyTime` drops a pre-existing self-loop whose two
endpoints rename together. -/

/-- **A discharged self-guard survives the identification arm, renamed.**

Three steps, exactly the ones the design was fixed on. (1) No constraint is dropped:
`identifyTime_no_collapse` gives `rho t₂ t₁ a ≠ rho t₂ t₁ b` for every constraint, and
`TimeOrdering.identifyTime`'s `filterMap` discards only when the two components collapse. (2)
Non-emptiness transports: `futureOf_transport` / `pastOf_transport` carry a witnessing member of the
reach to a member of the renamed reach, length-preservingly, so the `100`-step fuel bound is
re-met at the same length. (3) The column index lines up, because `rhoSF` acts on the label's time
by exactly the `rho` the reach transport is stated at. -/

/-- **The identification arm does not increase the self-guard potential.**

`Finset.card_le_card` over the previous lemma: the filter's `true`-set only grows, so the
`false`-set only shrinks, inside an index set that does not move. No injection from the after-set
into the before-set is required, and none is available — `rhoSF t₂ t₁` is not injective on `U`.
This is the same skeleton as `mintPotential_identifyTime`, one lemma deeper.

Because the renaming is *post-composed* onto the parameter, the statement applies unchanged at a
second, third or `n`-th identification along the same run. -/

/-! #### The σ-hit obligation, discharged rather than carried

Register entry 14 instructed that the σ-hit residual be *carried structurally* rather than
discharged, and Phase 1's gate is why: at the unoriented arm it is false, so carrying it was the
only honest option. `SigmaTimeStable` changes that. The obligation asks for some `sf ∈ U` whose
σ-image sits at the trigger's time; the trigger is a branch formula; confinement puts it in `U`; and
σ-time-stability says σ does not move it off its own time. Three facts, one line, no search.

This is the single place where the reorientation pays off in the measure's own terms, and it is
worth being precise about what it costs. Nothing is assumed here that a consumer does not already
have: `∀ x ∈ b, x ∈ U` is `MintPaysForTime`'s own second hypothesis, unchanged since the predicate
was written, and `SigmaTimeStable σ b` is discharged at the identification arm by
`sigmaTimeStable_identifyOriented`. -/

/-- **The σ-hit obligation, discharged from confinement and σ-time-stability.**

The trigger witnesses its own hit. `mintPotential_lt_of_mint`'s formula-level obligation is *not*
available this way — it needs `σ sf = g` on the nose, and `rhoSF`'s image genuinely omits formulas —
but the time-level obligation `selfGuardPotential` reads is, and that difference is the whole reason
the fourth component is indexed by time rather than by formula. -/

  ⟨sf, hconf sf hsf, hst sf hsf⟩

/-- **`SigmaTimeStable` at a single renaming is exactly "the branch has lost the retired index".**

An `iff`, so it can be used in both directions: to *discharge* stability from a branch fact, and to
*read off* a branch fact from stability. `sigmaTimeStable_identifyOriented` is the forward direction
instantiated at the arm's own post-state; this is the general statement behind it. -/

/-- **…and a branch every one of whose times is above the retired index is stable.**

The form the run-level argument consumes. Under the oriented arm the retired index is strictly below
the post-arm `nextTime` (`retired_lt_nextTime_oriented`) and `nextTime` is non-decreasing along the
run (`nextTime_monotone_along_run`), so every time the run mints after the arm is strictly above
every index the arm retired — which is exactly this hypothesis, and is why growth cannot break
stability. -/

/-! #### The discharge lemmas: `untlNeg` and `snceNeg` pay for their own mints

Each self-guarded rule fires only when its own reach is empty and returns an ordering that makes
that reach non-empty. So its trigger's column flips uncured → cured at exactly the step it mints,
and by `selfGuardPotential_le_of_grow` no other column flips the other way — the edge is *added*,
never removed. One column strictly lost from a set that only shrinks is a strict decrease.

**Research risk R2 is dissolved rather than discharged, and that is a finding worth recording.**
The plan asked for a prior lemma placing the freshly minted time outside the ordering's endpoints,
on the worry that the mint might create a new *uncured* column and cancel the flip. It cannot:
`selfGuardPotential` does not take a `Branch`, the index set `selfGuardRules ×ˢ U` is fixed, and a
mint step changes neither `U` nor `σ`. So the freshly minted formula has no column at all unless it
already had one, and the column indices do not move. The `OrdTimesKnown`-plus-`nextTime > maxTime`
argument the plan reserved for this is not needed, and reaching for it would have been reaching for
a fact about a quantity the component deliberately does not read.

**Research risk R3 is resolved by measurement, not by assumption.** The `snceNeg` mirror below is
exact: same guard shape read off the arm's own `if` rather than off its comment
(`pastTimes.isEmpty && timeCount > 0 && timeCount < 4`), same one-edge `newOrd`
(`timeOrd.addPast l.time freshTime`), and `addPast ord t tf = (tf, t) :: ord.constraints`, so the
curing edge runs *into* the trigger's time and `mem_pastOf_of_mem_constraints` closes it. The proof
is a transcription with `futureOf → pastOf` and nothing else changed. -/

/-- **Adding a forward edge out of an uncured time strictly drops the potential.**

Stated at the ordering operation rather than at the rule, because that is where the content is: the
rule's contribution is `newOrd = ord.addFuture l.time freshTime` and its guard
`(ord.futureOf l.time).isEmpty`, both of which appear here as hypotheses and are supplied at the
engine level by `applyRule_untlNeg_active_ord`.

The σ-hit hypothesis is `hhit`, and it is **not** vacuous: `sigma_time_hit_of_sigmaTimeStable`
discharges it from confinement plus σ-time-stability, and `selfGuardPotential_lt_at_orientedGate`
decides the whole conclusion at a concrete configuration. At the unoriented arm it is false, which
is what `mintPaysForTimeAt_reuse_false` records. -/

/-! #### The run-level form of the σ hypothesis, and the no-leak confirmation

`SigmaTimeStable σ b` is stated per *formula*, which is the weakest form the discharge lemmas need
and therefore the right one to put in the predicate. It is **not** the right form to carry along a
run, and the reason is worth stating rather than discovering later: the identification arm replaces
branch formulas by their renamed images, and a renamed image need not have been on the branch
before, so a per-formula hypothesis about the old branch says nothing about it.

The time-level strengthening `SigmaTimeFixed` closes that gap. It quantifies over *every* formula
sitting at a branch time rather than over branch formulas, which is exactly the extra reach the
arm's relabelling needs, and it implies the per-formula form immediately. Everything else about it
is the same: `id` satisfies it, the arm preserves it, and it is discharged rather than assumed.

**What is confirmed here, and what is left named.** The arm — the only step that changes σ — is
handled in full. Additive steps do not change σ at all, so the only way one can break the invariant
is by minting a time σ retires; `SigmaFixesFrom` plus `sigmaTimeFixed_grow_of_fixesFrom` is the
supply for that, and the fact that closes it is the reorientation's own
(`retired_lt_nextTime_oriented`: every index the arm retires is strictly below the `nextTime` at
which the run afterwards mints, and `nextTime_monotone_along_run` keeps it there). Assembling those
into a single run-level invariant is measure-level work and belongs with the step lemmas, not here;
it is named as an obligation rather than assumed. -/

/-- **The time-level form of the σ hypothesis.** Every formula sitting at a time the branch knows
keeps its time under `σ`.

Stronger than `SigmaTimeStable` in exactly one respect — it reaches formulas that are not on the
branch but sit at a time that is — and that is the respect the identification arm needs, since the
arm puts renamed formulas on the branch that were not there before. -/
def SigmaTimeFixed (σ : SignedFormula → SignedFormula) (b : Branch) : Prop :=
  ∀ x : SignedFormula, x.label.time ∈ b.knownTimes → (σ x).label.time = x.label.time

/-- The time-level form implies the per-formula form the predicate carries. One line: a branch
formula's time is a branch time. -/

theorem sigmaTimeFixed_id (b : Branch) : SigmaTimeFixed id b := fun _ _ => rfl

/-- **The identification arm preserves it.** The one step that changes `σ`, handled in full.

Two facts and nothing else. The post-arm branch's times are a subset of the pre-arm branch's
(`knownTimes_identifyTime_subset`, which is why the surviving numeral has to be a known time — the
same side condition `universeClosedAt_identify_at_trigger_oriented` carries, and no more), so the
old invariant applies to every time the new branch knows; and the post-arm branch has lost the
retired index, so the arm's own `rhoSF` is the identity on every time still present.

Under the *unoriented* arm this lemma is equally true — it is not what the reorientation buys. What
the reorientation buys is that the retired index stays retired, which is
`retired_lt_nextTime_oriented`'s business, not this one's. -/

/-- **The no-leak confirmation.** Three conjuncts, and together they are the whole claim that the
repair costs no consumer a hypothesis.

*The direction.* Conjunct 1: `MintPaysForTimeStable` is **weaker** than `MintPaysForTime` — a
disjunct was added and a hypothesis was added, and nothing was removed — so every terminus currently
carrying `MintPaysForTime` as a residual hypothesis can be restated against the repaired predicate
and the restatement is a **strengthening**. This is the `universeClosedAt_of_universeClosed` idiom
(`MintBound.lean` section D1) and the `ordTimesLeMaxTime_of_ordTimesKnown` idiom (section A3), used
here for the third time in this file. Saying this in words is not a formality: register entry 7
exists because a "simplification" that was secretly a weakening was once mistaken for a repair.

*The added hypothesis is discharged, not assumed.* Conjunct 2: the run starts inside it, since `σ`
is `id` before the first ordered split. Conjunct 3: the identification arm — the only step that
changes `σ` — preserves it, needing exactly the side condition
`universeClosedAt_identify_at_trigger_oriented` already carries and nothing more.

*What is named rather than closed.* Additive steps leave `σ` alone, so the only remaining way to
leave the invariant is to mint a time `σ` retires. `sigmaTimeFixed_grow_of_fixesFrom` reduces that
to a watermark, and `retired_lt_nextTime_oriented` plus `nextTime_monotone_along_run` supply the
watermark; assembling them into a single quantified run invariant is measure-level work and is
carried as a named obligation of the step lemmas, not discharged here.

*The only other cost is a coefficient.* A fourth component forces `mintPathBound` / `mintAwareFuel`
to absorb `2·(Tmax²+1)·2·|U|`. That is an arithmetic enlargement of exactly the kind register entry
8 already records for `splitAwareFuel_le_mintAwareFuel` — not a new assumption on any caller, and
not a change to any consuming terminus's hypothesis list. -/

/-! #### The four-component measure

`budgetPotential` is byte-unchanged; this is a new declaration alongside it, additive in the literal
sense — the original plus one weighted summand.

**Two things had to change from the plan-time design, and both are findings rather than choices.**

*The state's budget clause is the mint budget **plus** the fourth component.* A self-guarded mint
necessarily raises `mintTimeBudget`: it adds a time to `knownTimes` and leaves `mintPotential` alone,
because `untlNeg` and `snceNeg` are not in `freshLabelRules`. So `BudgetState` cannot survive the very
step the fourth component exists to pay for, and no weight fixes that — the failure is in the state
predicate, not in the measure. `BudgetStateAt` carries `mintTimeBudget + selfGuardPotential ≤ Tmax`
instead, and the arithmetic works because the mint spends exactly one unit of the fourth component
to buy the one unit of mint budget it consumes. That is the component *funding* the budget rather
than sitting beside it, and it is why the repaired predicate's third disjunct has to be a **pair**.

*The third disjunct is a pair, mirroring disjunct 2.* Disjunct 2 pairs a `mintPotential` drop with a
`mintTimeBudget` non-increase; disjunct 3 pairs a `selfGuardPotential` drop with a **combined**-budget
non-increase. Without the second conjunct `extensionAllowance` is unbounded above at the step — it
carries a factor of `|U|` per unit of mint budget — and the measure does not fall. This is why
`MintPaysForTimeAt → MintPaysForTimeStable` is unavailable and is not claimed.

*The weight is `2·(Tmax² + 1) + |U|`, not `2·(Tmax² + 1)`.* The extra `|U|` is exactly what pays for
`extensionAllowance`'s rise across a step that spends combined budget. The plan-time figure was read
off `splitOrderedRank`'s rise alone and did not account for the allowance; the correction is recorded
here rather than absorbed.

Neither change touches a landed declaration, and neither is a new hypothesis on any caller:
`BudgetStateAt`'s clause is a *strengthening* of `BudgetState`'s, discharged at the seed by choosing
`Tmax` with the slack `selfGuardPotential_le_two_mul` bounds at `2·|U|` — a figure enlargement of
exactly the kind register entry 8 records. -/

/-- **The carried state, at the four-component measure.** `BudgetState`'s three clauses with the
third replaced by the *combined* budget: the mint budget plus the self-guard potential.

The combination is load-bearing, not cosmetic. A self-guarded mint raises `mintTimeBudget` by one
and lowers `selfGuardPotential` by at least one, so the sum is non-increasing at exactly the step
the plain clause fails at. Measured at the oriented gate: `26 + 3 = 29` before, `27 + 1 = 28` after
(`orientedGate_disjunct3_holds`). -/

    SigmaTimeFixed σ b ∧ SigmaFixesFrom σ b.nextTime
/-- **The four-component measure.** `budgetPotential` plus the self-guard coordinate at weight
`2·(Tmax² + 1) + |U|`.

The weight has to dominate everything a step that spends one unit of combined budget can add:
`(Tmax² + 1)` for the extra known time in `splitOrderedRank`, `Tmax²` for a full incomparable-pair
range (`incompPairs_card_le` at `knownTimes.card ≤ Tmax`), and `|U|` for `extensionAllowance`'s
per-budget-unit factor. `2·(Tmax² + 1) + |U|` clears all three with a unit to spare, which is why
the drop is by at least one however much the step mints. -/

/-- **Constraint (F), tested at the arm before the inequality is attempted.** The fourth component
does not rise at the ordered split's identification arm.

This is the plan's own gate on Phase 7 and it passes with equality-or-better:
`selfGuardPotential_identifyOriented` is exactly the statement, read at the arm's own
`(min t₁ t₂, max t₁ t₂)`. Had it failed, the phase would have been blocked rather than rescued by
re-weighting — the research shows re-weighting is unsatisfiable, since the mint-side rise scales
identically. -/

`budgetPotential_step_splitOrdered` re-proved, with exactly one additional input per arm — the
fourth component's non-increase, multiplied by the weight — and the state clause discharged from the
same inputs. Arms 1 and 2 get it from `selfGuardPotential_le_of_grow` (the arms only add an edge);
arm 3 gets it from `selfGuardPotential_le_at_arm3`. `hrk`, `hEmul` and `hEexp` are unchanged, which
is the plan's Scope Hypothesis for this phase confirmed rather than assumed.

No residual is consumed here: an ordered split does not mint, so the repaired predicate is not used
at all. -/

/-- **The measure drops at `.extended` and at every arm of a `.split`, at the four-component
measure.**

`budgetPotential_step_unordered` re-proved against `MintPaysForTimeStable`. Disjuncts 1 and 2 are the
landed cases with the fourth component along for the ride — it cannot rise, since an unordered step
only grows the ordering (`expandOnceUnblocked_ord_mono`). Disjunct 3 is the new case and the one the
whole task is about: the self-guarded mint pays for itself.

*The disjunct-3 arithmetic, in one line.* The combined-budget conjunct caps the rise in
`extensionAllowance` at `|U|` per unit of self-guard drop and the rise in `splitOrderedRank` at
`(Tmax² + 1)` per unit plus one incomparable-pair range; the weight `2·(Tmax² + 1) + |U|` pays for
all of it and leaves `(Tmax² + 1) − Tmax² = 1` over, and `hgrow` supplies one more. So the drop is by
at least two.

`hstab` is the repaired predicate's own added hypothesis, threaded through unchanged; it is
discharged at the seed by `sigmaTimeFixed_id` and at the identification arm by
`sigmaTimeFixed_identifyOriented`. -/

/-! #### The per-step bundle and the fuel figure at the four-component measure

Section C6's induction is genuinely abstract over the carried state, the measure and the invariant —
`StepDecreases` mentions no branch cardinality, no known-time count, no mint potential and no
ordering rank — so this is an **instantiation**, not a re-proof. The plan's Scope Hypothesis for
this phase asked that that be confirmed before anything was written rather than assumed; it is
confirmed: `stepDecreases_budgetPotentialAt` below is `stepDecreases_budgetPotential`'s proof with
the two step lemmas swapped and nothing else changed.

The figure enlarges by the fourth component's ceiling times its weight,
`(2·(Tmax² + 1) + |U|)·2·|U|` — `selfGuardPotential_le_two_mul` is the ceiling — in exactly the
shape `splitAwareFuel_le_mintAwareFuel` records for the previous enlargement. Nothing stated at the
landed figure is withdrawn. -/

/-- **The per-step bundle, discharged at the four-component measure.** Byte-for-byte
`stepDecreases_budgetPotential` with `budgetPotentialAt_step_unordered` and
`budgetPotentialAt_step_splitOrdered` in place of their three-component originals: `hβ`, `hD`, the
arity facts and the difficulty facts are all reached through `hst.2.1`, which is the confinement
clause both state predicates share in the same position. -/

/-- **The four-component measure sits under the enlarged path bound.** The one arithmetic fact
connecting the induction to a concrete figure, at the repaired measure.

Three of the four components are capped exactly as `budgetPotential_lt_mintPathBound` caps them;
the fourth is capped by `selfGuardPotential_le_two_mul`, whose coefficient is the index set's width
and not `|U|`-dependent in any other way. Note the state's budget clause is the *combined* one, so
`hbud` gives the mint budget a bound with room for the self-guard potential rather than on the
nose — which is why the mint-side inputs are re-derived here rather than reused. -/

/-! #### The terminus chain, restated at the repaired predicate

The six theorems below are the `_at` chain with `MintPaysForTime` exchanged for
`MintPaysForTimeStable`, `BudgetState` for `BudgetStateAt`, `budgetPotential` for
`budgetPotentialAt`, and `mintAwareFuel` for `mintAwareFuelAt`. **The originals are untouched** and
nothing stated at them is withdrawn — `mintAwareFuel_le_mintAwareFuelAt` is the statement that the
figures compose rather than compete.

*The classification, run before anything was restated.* `grep MintPaysForTime` reports eleven
hypothesis sites in this file. Nine are intermediate — the step lemmas, `stepDecreases`,
`expandBranchWithFuel_isSome_of_budget`, `buildTableauAt_isSome_of_budget` and their `_at` siblings
— and pass the residual on without inspecting it. Exactly **two** are seed-level, in the sense that
they quantify no `U` and read every number off a concrete `signedUniverse C L`:
`buildTableauAt_isSome_of_lengthBudget_signedUniverse` and
`buildTableauAt_isSome_at_seed_lengthBudget_signedUniverse`. Both are restated below; the parent
plan's Scope Hypothesis named a different pair (`buildTableauAt_isSome_at_seed` and
`..._at_seed_lengthBudget`), and the correction is that those two still quantify `U` — they are
seed-level in the *fuel* coordinate only.

*The only new number.* The mint budget floor rises from `8·|U|` to `10·|U|`, because the carried
state's budget clause is now the combined one and `selfGuardPotential ≤ 2·|U|`. `derivedTmaxAt`
carries the same enlargement into the caller-facing form. That is a figure, not a hypothesis: no
caller's hypothesis *list* changes, and `derivedTmax_le_derivedTmaxAt` records that the time bound
grows rather than moves. -/

/-- **The derived time bound at the four-component measure.** The initial known-time count plus the
enlarged mint budget: `8·|U|` for the mint dimension and `2·|U|` for the self-guard dimension, the
two ceilings `mintPotential_le_eight_mul` and `selfGuardPotential_le_two_mul` supply. -/

The seed state is built at `σ = id`, where both σ clauses are free — `sigmaTimeFixed_id` and

The combined budget clause is where the enlarged floor is consumed. -/

residuals — `MintPaysForTimeStable`, `PostBlockingSettles`, `UnorderedSuccessorLabelClosed` — and
reads the fuel and the branch budget off the statement.

*What changed relative to `buildTableauAt_isSome_at_seed_lengthBudget_signedUniverse`.* One
residual is weaker (`MintPaysForTimeStable` in place of `MintPaysForTime`,
`mintPaysForTimeStable_of_mintPaysForTime`), and two figures are larger (`mintAwareFuelAt`,
`derivedTmaxAt`, both recorded as enlargements). The hypothesis **list** is identical, name for

/-! #### The repaired predicate discharged, and the boundary at which it stops

`mintPaysForTime_empty` records the satisfiability boundary for the landed predicate: the residual
is satisfiable exactly where the terminus it guards has nothing to say, since `signedUniverse C L`
is empty only when `C` or `L` is. The repaired predicate inherits that boundary verbatim, and the
discharge below is stated at a **concrete** `signedUniverse C L` rather than at the bare `∅`, so it
instantiates the seed-level termini above rather than only their `U`-quantified ancestors.

**What blocks a discharge at a nonempty universe, precisely.** It is the density coordinate, and
not the σ-hit obligation any more. *(Corrected below: this account is incomplete. The subsection
"The formula-level σ obligation, and the refutation it forces" decides that
`MintPaysForTimeStable` is **false** at a concrete nonempty `signedUniverse`, with no `densityRule`
in the vehicle — the time-level σ hypothesis does not reach the formula-level obligation disjunct 2
carries. Read the paragraph below as one of two blockers, not the only one; see register entry
20.)* `densityRule` mints a fresh time and lies outside **both**
`freshLabelRules` and `selfGuardRules`, so at a `densityRule` step disjunct 1 fails (the mint raises
`knownTimes`), disjunct 2 cannot move (`mintPotential` does not read the rule) and disjunct 3 cannot
move (`selfGuardDischarged` reports the catch-all `true` for it). That is the residual
`MintPaysForTimeAt`'s obligation map already names, carried here unchanged: the intended second
component is `gapPotential`, indexed by `U ×ˢ U` and gated on `denseRules`, and it is implemented
nowhere and assumed by nothing.

`densityRule` is `denseRules`-gated, so it cannot fire at a frame class outside `.Dense` /
`.RTime`; a discharge restricted to the other classes is therefore not refuted. What it needs is
a rule-by-rule census showing that every remaining rule either mints no time (disjunct 1), is
witness-guarded (disjunct 2) or is self-guarded (disjunct 3). That census is the parent plan's
time-minting-census work read in the other direction, and it is **not attempted here** — stated as
a named next step rather than gestured at. See register entries 19 and 20. -/

/-- **The satisfiability boundary, at the repaired predicate.** The exact mirror of
`mintPaysForTime_empty`, and for the same reason: confinement forces the branch empty, the engine
reports `.saturated`, and `unorderedSuccessorBranches` of a `.saturated` result is `[]`.

The added `SigmaTimeStable` hypothesis is discarded rather than used, which is the honest reading —
this discharge is about the universe being empty, not about the renaming. -/

fewer at `L = ∅`. It is also, by `mintPaysForTime_empty`'s own argument, exactly as far as the

nonempty discharge needs, and register entry 19 for the record. -/

/-! #### The formula-level σ obligation, and the refutation it forces

The subsection above stops at `U = ∅` and names the **density** coordinate as what blocks a
nonempty discharge. That account is incomplete, and the missing half is decided here rather than
argued: `MintPaysForTimeStable` is **false** at a concrete nonempty `signedUniverse C L`, at every
frame class and every `Tmax`, with no `densityRule` anywhere near the vehicle.

*Why the density account missed it.* `sigma_time_hit_of_sigmaTimeStable` discharges the σ-hit
obligation `selfGuardPotential` reads, and its own docstring already records that
`mintPotential_lt_of_mint`'s obligation is **not** available the same way — it needs `σ sf = g` on
the nose. Disjunct 2 is the only disjunct that pays for the six rules in
`freshLabelRules ∩ freshTimeRules`, and those rules mint at times whose reach the self-guard
component may already count as cured, so disjunct 3 cannot stand in for it. `SigmaTimeStable`
constrains σ's *times* and nothing else, so a renaming that preserves every label and destroys every
formula satisfies it while pinning `mintPotential` at its ceiling forever.

*The vehicle.* `flatSigma` sends every signed formula to a fixed positive atom **at its own label**.
`witnessPresent`'s match is on `(rule, sign, formula)` and every arm that could fire needs a
temporal or modal shape, so an atom falls through to the catch-all at all thirty-six rules:
`mintPotential U flatSigma b ord = 8 · |U|` at *every* state (`mintPotential_flatSigma`), so
disjunct 2's strict inequality is unavailable at every step of every run. What remains is to find
one step that mints while curing no self-guard column, and `untlPos` at a time whose future is
already non-empty is such a step — it is witness-guarded, so it is exactly one of the six rules
disjunct 2 was carrying.

*What is not claimed.* This does not withdraw anything. `MintPaysForTimeStable`'s direction lemma,
its no-leak confirmation, the four-component measure and the restated termini all stand exactly as
they are; what changes is the reading of the residual they carry, from "open at nonempty `U`, at the
density coordinate" to "false at nonempty `U`, at the formula coordinate, **and** open at the
density coordinate". See register entry 20. -/

/-- **The formula-destroying, time-preserving renaming.** Every signed formula goes to a fixed
positive atom at its own label, so the label — and therefore the time — is untouched and the formula
is gone. -/
def flatSigma : SignedFormula → SignedFormula := fun x => ⟨Sign.pos, mwP, x.label⟩

theorem flatSigma_sigmaTimeStable (b : Branch) : SigmaTimeStable flatSigma b := fun _ _ => rfl

/-- **Its image is witness-free at every rule, state and ordering.** `witnessPresent` matches on the
formula's shape at all eight fresh-label arms — `.box`, `asDiamond?`, `.allFuture`, `.allPast`,
`asSomeFuture?`, `asSomePast?`, `asUntil?`, `asSince?` — and an atom matches none of them, so every
arm falls through to the catch-all. Decided over all thirty-six constructors. -/

`mintPotential_le_eight_mul`, which bounds it: under `flatSigma` the bound is met with equality
everywhere, so the potential is a constant function of the state and disjunct 2's strict inequality
is unavailable at every step of every run — before any configuration is chosen. -/

theorem fh_universe_card : (signedUniverse fhStock fhLabels).card = 18 := by decide

/-- **`MintPaysForTimeStable` is false at a concrete nonempty `signedUniverse`**, at every frame
class and every `Tmax`.

The step is `untlPos` firing on the trigger at time `1`; the engine reports a two-arm `.split` and
this is its first arm. On it, all three disjuncts fail on decided numbers:

* disjunct 1 — `knownTimes` goes `{0,1,2}` to `{0,1,2,3}`, so `4 ≤ 3` is false;
* disjunct 2 — `mintPotential` is `8·18 = 144` before **and** after, by `mintPotential_flatSigma`,
  which is a general fact and not a measurement at this configuration;
* disjunct 3 — `selfGuardPotential` is `12` before and `12` after: the step's only new edge is
  `(1, 3)`, time `1`'s future was already non-empty, and no formula of the universe sits at time `3`.

The four frame classes are decided separately, and `Tmax` is universally quantified because
disjunct 1 fails at its first conjunct and disjunct 2 fails by an identity, neither of which
mentions `Tmax`.

Contrast `mintPaysForTime_untlNeg_false`, which refutes the *unrepaired* predicate with a
**self-guarded** vehicle at `σ = id`. That refutation is what the fourth measure component answers.
This one is at a **witness-guarded** vehicle, and what it defeats is the hypothesis
`MintPaysForTimeStable` adds rather than the ledger it adds. -/

/-! #### The formula-level repair: `SigmaFixed`, and the residual restated at it

The refutation above localises the defect precisely — the added hypothesis constrains σ's *times*
where disjunct 2 needs it to constrain σ's *formulas* — so the repair is to state the hypothesis at
the coordinate the obligation lives at, and nowhere else. Nothing else about the predicate changes:
the three disjuncts are the same three, in the same order, with the same conjuncts.

**The repair is free at the arm, which is the whole reason it is available.** `rhoSF src tgt` renames
one time and leaves every other formula strictly alone, so `rhoSF_eq_of_ne_src` is the same one-line
fact as `rhoSF_time_eq_of_ne_src` with the conclusion strengthened from "same time" to "same
formula". Every lemma of the σ layer transcribes across that strengthening with no new content:
`sigmaFixed_identifyOriented` is `sigmaTimeStable_identifyOriented`'s proof verbatim,
`sigmaFormulaFixed_identifyOriented` is `sigmaTimeFixed_identifyOriented`'s, and the watermark
lemmas are `sigmaFixesFrom_*`'s. That the strengthening costs nothing at the one step that changes σ
is a fact about `rhoSF`, not a coincidence, and it is why the repair does not have to be paid for
anywhere downstream: **no figure changes** — `mintPathBoundAt`, `mintAwareFuelAt` and `derivedTmaxAt`
are reused unaltered, unlike the fourth component, which cost a coefficient.

**What is bought.** `sigma_formula_hit_of_sigmaFixed` discharges
`mintPotential_lt_of_mint`'s obligation from confinement alone — the trigger witnesses its own hit,
exactly as `sigma_time_hit_of_sigmaTimeStable` does at the time level — and
`mintPotential_lt_of_pick_linear_sigmaFixed` / `..._branching_sigmaFixed` are that discharge
delivered at the pick, which is where disjunct 2 is actually established. So the added hypothesis is
not inert, and the sense in which it is not is a proved implication rather than a measurement.

**What is not bought.** The density coordinate, unchanged. `densityRule` mints a fresh time while
lying outside both `freshLabelRules` and `selfGuardRules`, so no disjunct moves at a `densityRule`
step whatever σ is; it is `denseRules`-gated, so a discharge restricted to the frame classes outside
`.Dense` / `.RTime` is not refuted, and what such a discharge needs is the rule-by-rule census
register entry 19 names. That census is **not** attempted here. See register entry 20. -/

/-- **`rhoSF` is the identity on a formula away from the retired index** — not merely on its time.
The strengthening of `rhoSF_time_eq_of_ne_src` that the whole formula-level layer rests on, and it
is the same one line: `rho` is a conditional on the time, so off the retired index the record is
rebuilt from its own fields. -/

lemma asks for `σ sf = g` on the nose and `SigmaTimeStable` supplies only `(σ sf).label.time =
g.label.time`. `flatSigma_not_sigmaFixed` decides that the gap is real rather than notional. -/

verbatim, with `SigmaTimeStable σ b` exchanged for `SigmaFixed σ b` and nothing else touched — the
same three disjuncts, in the same order, with the same conjuncts.

**The direction.** `SigmaFixed` is stronger than `SigmaTimeStable`, so requiring it makes the
predicate **weaker**: the implication runs `MintPaysForTimeStable → MintPaysForTimeFixed` and never
the other way, and every theorem restated against it is a **strengthening**. This is the
`universeClosedAt_of_universeClosed` idiom for the fourth time in this file, and saying it in words
is not a formality — register entry 7 exists because a weakening was once mistaken for a repair.

**What the exchange buys, and what it costs.** It buys the formula-level σ-hit
(`sigma_formula_hit_of_sigmaFixed`), which is what disjunct 2 needs at the six rules in
`freshLabelRules ∩ freshTimeRules` and which `SigmaTimeStable` provably does not supply
(`mintPaysForTimeStable_signedUniverse_false`). It costs **nothing**: the added hypothesis is
discharged at the seed by `sigmaFormulaFixed_id` and at the identification arm by
`sigmaFormulaFixed_identifyOriented`, no figure changes, and no caller's hypothesis list changes.

**What it does not touch.** The density coordinate. At a `densityRule` step disjunct 1 fails (the
mint raises `knownTimes`), disjunct 2 cannot move (`densityRule ∉ freshLabelRules`) and disjunct 3
cannot move (`densityRule ∉ selfGuardRules`), for every σ whatsoever — so this predicate is
separately refutable at `.Dense` / `.RTime` by a `densityRule` vehicle, and a discharge at the
other frame classes needs the rule-by-rule census register entries 19 and 20 name. That census is
not attempted here, and `gapPotential` remains implemented nowhere and assumed by nothing. -/

/-- **The no-leak confirmation at the formula level.** Five conjuncts, and together they are the
claim that the repair costs no consumer a hypothesis.

*The direction*, twice: from the original predicate and from the previous repair, so the chain of
weakenings is explicit and neither link is left to inference. *Discharged, not assumed*: the seed
satisfies the invariant because σ is `id` there, and the arm's own renaming satisfies the
per-formula form on the state the arm produces with **no** membership side condition, which is
strictly better than the time-level layer needed. *Preserved*: the arm carries the invariant
forward under exactly the side condition
`universeClosedAt_identify_at_trigger_oriented` already carries.

*And the cost, stated so it can be checked.* Unlike the fourth measure component, which cost a
coefficient in `mintPathBound` and `derivedTmax`, this repair costs **no figure at all**:
`budgetPotentialAt`, `mintPathBoundAt`, `mintAwareFuelAt` and `derivedTmaxAt` are reused byte for

/-- **The measure drops at `.extended` and at every arm of a `.split`, at the formula-level
state.** `budgetPotentialAt_step_unordered` re-proved against `MintPaysForTimeFixed`. The three
disjunct cases are byte-identical; the edits are confined to the σ layer — `hstab` is now
`sigmaFixed_of_sigmaFormulaFixed`, and the successor's two clauses come from
`sigmaFormulaFixed_grow_of_fixesFrom` and `sigmaFixesFormulasFrom_mono`, on the same two supplies
(`unorderedSuccessor_time_dichotomy` and `nextTime_monotone_along_run`) the time-level proof uses.

That the transcription is this mechanical is the content of the repair's cost claim: strengthening
the σ hypothesis from times to formulas is free at every step, because `rhoSF` is the identity on
formulas away from the one index it retires. -/

/-! #### The formula-level predicate discharged, and the boundary at which it stops

The boundary is inherited verbatim from `mintPaysForTimeStable_empty`, and for the same reason:
confinement forces the branch empty, the engine reports `.saturated`, and
`unorderedSuccessorBranches` of a `.saturated` result is `[]`. What is **not** inherited is the
refutation — `flatSigma_not_sigmaFixed` decides that the vehicle above does not reach this
predicate, so the boundary is where the discharge currently stops rather than where it is known to
fail.

**What a nonempty discharge needs, precisely, and what is already available.** For the six rules in
`freshLabelRules ∩ freshTimeRules` disjunct 2 is now supplied at the pick, by
`mintPotential_lt_of_pick_linear_sigmaFixed` and `mintPotential_lt_of_pick_branching_sigmaFixed`.
For the two rules of `selfGuardRules` disjunct 3 is supplied by `selfGuardPotential_lt_of_untlNeg`
and `selfGuardPotential_lt_of_snceNeg`, whose σ-hit comes from `SigmaFixed` a fortiori. For the
twenty-seven rules outside `freshTimeRules`, `applyRule_emitted_time_dichotomy` says the step emits
at no new time, which is disjunct 1's first conjunct, and `expandOnceUnblocked_ord_mono` gives the
second. What is missing is the **engine-level assembly**: threading the pick's rule through
`expandOnceUnblocked`'s three stages so that the case split above is available at the successor,
for every rule at once.

**And the one rule none of that reaches.** `densityRule`. It mints a fresh time and lies outside
both `freshLabelRules` and `selfGuardRules`, so no disjunct moves at a `densityRule` step for any σ
whatsoever — the assembly above therefore delivers a discharge only at frame classes where
`denseRules` cannot fire, and the intended second component `gapPotential` (indexed by `U ×ˢ U`,
`denseRules`-gated) remains implemented nowhere and assumed by nothing. Neither the assembly nor
`gapPotential` is attempted here; both are stated as named next steps. See register entry 20.

**Where that boundary has since moved.** Section D3 discharges the predicate — and its unrepaired
original — at every universe of `untl`/`snce`-free formulas, hence at a nonempty
`signedUniverse C L`, at every frame class. Neither the assembly nor `gapPotential` is needed
there, because both are obligations on a time mint and no rule of `freshTimeRules` is applicable to
such a formula: every one of the nine is gated on a shape carrying an `untl` or `snce` node, and
`densityRule` is excluded by that gate before its `Dense ≤ fc` gate is consulted. So what the two
named next steps actually gate is the discharge at a universe carrying a **temporal** operator. -/

/-! ## C11. Clause 1's label dimension, discharged from branch-side headroom

**What this section spends.** Section C10 left clause 1's label dimension as the named residual
`UnorderedSuccessorLabelClosed`, and its obligation map recorded one coordinate as available and one
as absent: the world coordinate had `applyRule_emitted_world_dichotomy`, and the time coordinate had
no statement at all bounding the times a rule emits at. Section D1 has since landed exactly that
statement — `applyRule_emitted_time_dichotomy`, together with the engine-level
`unorderedSuccessor_time_dichotomy`. This section spends it, and the accounting is now complete in
both coordinates.

**What completing the accounting does and does not buy.** It buys the *reduction*: the label
dimension of every unordered successor follows from a branch-side headroom condition, as a theorem
(`unorderedSuccessor_label_mem_of_headroom`), with nothing left unaccounted. It does **not** buy the
residual's discharge, and no lemma could have: clause 1 is *refuted* at a fixed finite
`signedUniverse C L` (`universeClosed_fresh_world_escapes`), and no condition on `L` repairs it
(`freshWorldHeadroom_not_universal`). So the residual survives — but it survives for a proved reason
rather than for a missing lemma, and that is the difference this section makes. The honest bracket is
stated as `freshLabelHeadroom_not_universal`.

**The rectangle, and why the world condition alone was never enough.** A label is a *pair*. The two
dichotomies are per-coordinate: a successor's worlds lie in `b.worldFinset ∪ {b.nextWorld}` and its
times lie in `b.knownTimes ∪ {b.nextTime}`, but nothing correlates the two, so four quadrants have to
be covered rather than two. `FreshWorldHeadroom` covers one of them. Confinement of `b` covers *not
even one*: `∀ x ∈ b, x.label ∈ L` says the pairs `b` actually carries are in `L`, which does not put
`⟨w, t⟩` in `L` for a `w` and a `t` that `b` carries on different formulas. `FreshLabelHeadroom` is
the rectangle the two dichotomies actually license, and `freshWorldHeadroom_of_freshLabelHeadroom`
records that it is the strictly stronger of the two. This is the same rectangle shape
`timeMergeClosed_iff_product` found on the clause-2 side, arrived at from the opposite direction. -/

/-- **The world dichotomy at engine level.** Every world an unordered successor mentions is a world
`b` mentioned, or `b.nextWorld`. One step adds at most the one fresh world, and never more.

The exact counterpart of `unorderedSuccessor_time_dichotomy`, assembled the same way and through the
same invariant-agnostic machinery — `pick_branches_eq`, `pick_stage_source`, `resultBranch_sub` — so
the three-stage pick is not destructured a second time. It carries **no** auxiliary hypothesis where
its time twin carries `OrdTimesKnown b ord`: `applyRule_emitted_world_dichotomy` needs nothing, since
no rule propagates a world through the `TimeOrdering` the way four of them propagate times through
`futureOf` / `pastOf`. See `applyRule_emitted_time_mem_ordTimesKnown_needed` for why the asymmetry is
real rather than an artifact of the proof. -/

Stated in exactly the shape the two dichotomies deliver — a disjunction per coordinate — so that no
step of `unorderedSuccessor_label_mem_of_headroom` has to reconcile a `Finset` form with a `List`
form. Four quadrants, not two, because the dichotomies are per-coordinate and nothing correlates
them; and the quadrant `⟨w, t⟩` with `w` and `t` both already on `b` is **not** free, because
confinement of `b` constrains the pairs `b` carries and not their cross product.

`FreshWorldHeadroom` is the third quadrant alone (`freshWorldHeadroom_of_freshLabelHeadroom`). Like
it, this is a condition on the **branch**: `freshLabelHeadroom_not_universal` proves it cannot be
moved into `L`. -/

/-- **Clause 1's label dimension, discharged.** Every formula on every unordered successor of an
`L`-confined branch with headroom sits at a label of `L`.

This is the statement the Phase 7 blocker named, and it is now a theorem rather than a hypothesis.
Both coordinates are accounted for and neither is assumed: `unorderedSuccessor_world_dichotomy` for
the world, `unorderedSuccessor_time_dichotomy` for the time, `FreshLabelHeadroom` for the four
quadrants they leave. Nothing else is used — in particular, confinement of `b` is **not** among the
hypotheses, because the headroom rectangle already subsumes what confinement would have supplied.

`OrdTimesKnown b ord` is inherited from the time dichotomy and is not new currency:
`ordTimesKnown_empty` supplies it at a run's seed and `expandOnceUnblocked_ordTimesKnown` propagates
it across every step, so nothing reaches the terminus that was not already there. -/

The composite the Phase 7 blocker was blocking. `TableauClosed C` and `TrichStock C` discharge the

label coordinate via `unorderedSuccessor_label_mem_of_headroom`. Contrast
`unorderedSuccessor_confined_signedUniverse_of_headroom`, which is the same statement carrying
`UnorderedSuccessorLabelClosed fc L` as an unanalyzed hypothesis: that one is retained verbatim and
is what the landed terminus chain consumes; this one is the analysis of it.

The two are not interchangeable, and the difference is exactly the quantifier. This form is
**per-branch**: the headroom is a hypothesis about the `b` in front of it. The residual form
quantifies over every `L`-confined branch at once, and in that position the headroom is *refutable*
(`freshLabelHeadroom_not_universal`). So this theorem does not discharge the residual — see the
section note. -/

`UnorderedSuccessorLabelClosed` quantifies over an arbitrary `TimeOrdering` with nothing tying it to
the branch, which is one hypothesis short of what `unorderedSuccessor_time_dichotomy` asks. This is
the same predicate with `OrdTimesKnown b ord` added, and it is therefore the *weaker* of the two —
`unorderedSuccessorLabelClosedOrd_of_unorderedSuccessorLabelClosed` records the implication. The
original is retained verbatim and is what the landed chain consumes; this one exists so that the
reduction below can be stated at all.

The added hypothesis is not a new cost at any consuming site:
`applyRule_emitted_time_mem_ordTimesKnown_needed` shows it is not removable, `ordTimesKnown_empty`
supplies it at a seed, and `expandOnceUnblocked_ordTimesKnown` propagates it. -/

/-- **The reduction, complete.** The residual follows from branch-side headroom on every `L`-confined
branch. No coordinate is left unaccounted, and no hypothesis, placeholder or unfinished step stands
the two.

This is what section D1's arrival makes provable. Read together with
`freshLabelHeadroom_not_universal` it is also the *end* of the line: the antecedent is refutable at
every nonempty `L`, so the reduction is complete without being a discharge. -/

Immediate from `freshWorldHeadroom_not_universal` through
`freshWorldHeadroom_of_freshLabelHeadroom`: the rectangle is the stronger condition, so refuting the
weaker one refutes it too. Stated separately because it is the load-bearing half of this section's
verdict — `unorderedSuccessorLabelClosedOrd_of_headroom` reduces the residual to exactly this
antecedent, and this says the antecedent is unavailable wherever the terminus is not vacuous.

So `UnorderedSuccessorLabelClosed` remains a residual, and now for a *proved* reason rather than for
a missing lemma. Register entry 11 records the finding; entry 21 records this refinement of it. -/

something already true.

The same witness `unorderedSuccessorLabelClosed_not_universal` uses, with the added ordering
hypothesis supplied by `ordTimesKnown_empty` — the witness runs at `TimeOrdering.empty`, so nothing
had to be rebuilt. Adding `OrdTimesKnown` to the residual therefore does not weaken it into

/-! ### The refutation generalizes: **every** nonempty `L`, not merely one witness

`unorderedSuccessorLabelClosed_not_universal` and `unorderedSuccessorLabelClosedOrd_not_universal`
refute the residual at one particular label set, `freshWorldLabels = {⟨0,0⟩}`. That is enough to
show it is not a theorem, but it leaves open the reading — which the earlier phrasing of register
entry 11 invited — that the residual might hold at *other* label sets, so that a consuming site
could be repaired by choosing `L` more carefully.

It cannot. The generalization is mechanical, and for a structural reason: the engine's shape gates
match a signed formula's **sign and formula constructor**, never its label. So `F(□p)` fires
`.boxNeg` at every label, not only at `Label.initial`, and what the rule emits always sits at the
branch's `Branch.nextWorld`, which at a one-formula branch labelled `l` is `l.world + 1` — this is
what `arAt_bn` below records, by `rfl`, with `l` a free variable. Running the witness at a label of
**maximal world** in `L` therefore puts the emission outside `L`'s world projection by maximality,
at every nonempty finite `L` and every frame class.

The other end is immediate: at `L = ∅` the confinement hypothesis `∀ x ∈ b, x.label ∈ L` forces
`b = []`, the pick finds nothing, and the conclusion holds vacuously. So the residual's
satisfiability set is **exactly `{∅}`** — and `∅` is precisely the case in which every theorem
carrying it as a hypothesis has an empty universe and says nothing.

The family below is stated **beside** the `freshWorld*` family, not in place of it: the
single-witness form is what the file's earlier sections cite, and it is not withdrawn. -/

/-! ## C12. The post-blocking settlement residual: refuted, and repaired

`PostBlockingSettles fc` (section C8) is the last settlement residual on the terminus, and its own
docstring names an open question: whether the gap between what `saturateBlocked` stops at and what
`findUnexpandedUnblockedWith` tests "can be closed by fuel alone". This section decides that
question — the answer is **no** — and lands the repair.

The two tests disagree, and the disagreement has nothing to do with fuel:

* `saturateBlocked` stops at `expandOnceNoFresh`'s `.saturated` verdict (`Saturation.lean`, the
  `(.saturated, _)` arm), and `expandOnceNoFresh` **skips** any candidate whose applicable rule
  mints a fresh label or lengthens the ordering constraints — its `pick` returns `none` for such a
  candidate and the search continues past it.
* `findUnexpandedUnblockedWith` tests `!isExpanded sf b ord fc`, i.e.
  `findApplicableRule sf b ord fc ≠ none`, with **no** reference to label-minting at all.

So a formula sitting at an unblocked time whose only applicable rule mints a fresh label is
invisible to the first test and visible to the second, at **every** fuel figure. That is the
refutation, and it is what the two theorems below decide.
-/

/-- **Gate 1: `PostBlockingSettles fc` is refuted at the `fuel = 0` arm**, at every frame class.

Not merely unproved: false. `saturateBlocked` at `fuel = 0` hands its input straight back
(`saturateBlocked_fuel_zero`), so the predicate's hypothesis is satisfied at **every** branch
whatsoever, and the predicate as literally stated therefore asserts that every branch is
blocking-aware saturated. The one-formula branch `[F(p → q)@⟨0,0⟩]` — the landed `multBranch 1`,
reused rather than rebuilt — is not: `.impNeg` applies to its only formula
(`findApplicableRule_multWitness`), nothing is blocked at the empty ordering
(`blockedTimes_empty`), so the finder reports that formula.

**What this does not show.** It is a statement about the `fuel = 0` arm alone, and it settles
nothing about larger fuel: a reader could reasonably suspect the predicate is one `fuel > 0` side
condition away from being true. `postBlockingSettles_fuel_gap_false` is the theorem that closes that
suspicion, and it is the substantive one. -/

/-- **The fuel-universal step.** If the branch is not closed and `expandOnceNoFresh` reports
`.saturated` on it, then `saturateBlocked` hands the branch straight back at **every** fuel figure.

No induction is needed and none is used: at `fuel = 0` the pass returns its input by definition, and
at `fuel + 1` it reaches the `(.saturated, _)` arm in one step, whose result is again the input. The
two `constraints.length` rejection guards and the three recursive arms are therefore not on this
branch's path at all, which is what makes the statement universal in `fuel` rather than a ladder of
checked figures. -/

rejection test fires and `pick` returns `none` — the candidate is skipped rather than reported. The
branch has nothing else, so the search ends with no pick and the verdict is `.saturated`.

This is the exact disagreement the residual's docstring names, exhibited: there is outstanding work
on the branch, and this pass is by construction unable to see it. -/

/-- **Gate 2: fuel does not close the gap.** The verdict on the open question
`PostBlockingSettles`'s own docstring poses.

`PostBlockingSettles fc` is refuted at a **nonzero** fuel — so this is not a restatement of
`postBlockingSettles_fuel_zero_false` — and `postBlockingSettles_gap_at_every_fuel` records that the
same witness works at every fuel whatsoever, not at the figure chosen here.

**The verdict, in one line.** Fuel does not close it, because `expandOnceNoFresh` *skips*
label-minting candidates while `findUnexpandedUnblockedWith` counts them, and no fuel figure appears
anywhere in that disagreement.

**What the witness is.** The landed `freshWorldBranch = [F(□p)@⟨0,0⟩]`, reused rather than rebuilt.
Its only applicable rule is `.boxNeg`, which mints a fresh **world**, so it trips
`expandOnceNoFresh`'s *first* rejection test (`ruleMintsFreshLabel`). Register entry 13 records that
the label-minting and time-minting rule lists are incomparable and that this is exactly why
`expandOnceNoFresh` runs two rejection tests in sequence; a time-minting witness would trip the
second test and refute the predicate the same way. -/

/-! ### The repaired predicate

Phase 2's witness locates the missing content at the **branch**, not at the fuel, so the repair
relocates exactly two hypotheses and changes the conclusion not at all. Both are stated about the
pass's **output** branch, which is where the settlement test is run.
-/

/-- **The pass ran to label-free saturation** rather than being truncated by fuel.

Stated as `(expandOnceNoFresh b ord fc).1 = .saturated` rather than as the pair equation
`expandOnceNoFresh b ord fc = (.saturated, ord)` the plan pre-declared. The narrowing is forced by
the frozen definition and is a *weakening* of the hypothesis, hence a strengthening of every
statement that assumes it: `expandOnceNoFresh`'s `.notApplicable` arm returns `(.saturated, newOrd)`
with the **picked** ordering rather than the incoming one, so the pair equation is strictly stronger
than the fact the settlement argument consumes, and `saturateBlocked`'s own `(.saturated, _)` arm
discards the second component too. -/
def LabelFreeSaturatedExit (b : Branch) (ord : TimeOrdering)
    (fc : FormalSystem.ProofSystem.FrameClass) : Prop :=
  (expandOnceNoFresh b ord fc).1 = ExpansionResult.saturated

/-- **No label-minting work is left sitting at an unblocked time.**

This is the disagreement Phase 2 exhibits, stated as a condition on the branch: every formula at an
unblocked time whose rule the engine finds applicable is one `expandOnceNoFresh` would have been
willing to fire — it neither mints a fresh label nor lengthens the ordering constraints. The witness
`freshWorldBranch` fails it at its one formula, which is exactly why it refutes the residual. -/
def NoUnblockedFreshWork (b : Branch) (ord : TimeOrdering)
    (fc : FormalSystem.ProofSystem.FrameClass) : Prop :=

      ruleMintsFreshLabel rule = false ∧
        newOrd.constraints.length ≤ ord.constraints.length

/-- **The repaired residual**: `PostBlockingSettles`'s statement with the two conditions above added
as antecedents on the **output** branch. The conclusion is carried over verbatim — no test is
weakened, no finder is replaced, and the frame class stays universally quantified. -/

      (blockedTimes satBr satOrd fc (armTracker satBr)) = none

/-- **The direction, fixed.** The hypothesis list is longer, so `PostBlockingSettlesAt` is the
**weaker** predicate, so every theorem restated against it is a **strengthening** — the same
direction `universeClosedAt_of_universeClosed` and `mintPaysForTimeFixed_of_mintPaysForTimeStable`
record for their own repairs, and the reason register entry 7 exists. -/

/-! ### The gate: can the consuming sites supply the two antecedents?

The repair is admissible only if `armSettlement_of_postBlockingSettles`'s and
`buildTableauAt_isSome_of_settles`'s proofs can supply the relocated hypotheses where they consume
the residual. Both sites reach the residual holding exactly one fact about the output pair — the
equation `saturateBlocked ob fuel oOrd fc = some (.inr (satBr, satOrd))` — so the question is
whether `LabelFreeSaturatedExit satBr satOrd fc` follows from that equation.

It does not, and the obstruction is decided rather than described.
-/

/-- **`.impNeg` fires on the one-formula branch under the label-free filter too.** Its rule mints no
label and adds no ordering constraint, so `expandOnceNoFresh`'s `pick` accepts it and the verdict is
`.extended`, not `.saturated`. -/

/-- **The obstruction, decided.** `saturateBlocked`'s `.inr` exit does **not** carry
`LabelFreeSaturatedExit` on its output: at `fuel = 0` the pass hands back its input untested, and
that input can have label-free work outstanding. So the relocated hypothesis is not derivable from
what either consuming site holds, and it is a genuine residual rather than a side condition a bridge
proof could discharge.

/-! ### The settlement lemma

The mathematical content of the repair: the two relocated antecedents really do force the
conclusion. Everything below is proved from the frozen files' **public** interface — `saturateBlocked`,
`expandOnceNoFresh`, `findApplicableRule`, `isExpanded`, `findUnexpandedUnblockedWith`,
`blockedTimes` and `ruleMintsFreshLabel` are all public `def`s, and `private` blocks name resolution
rather than unfolding (register entry 9's observation, used here in the direction where it helps).
-/

/-- **`findApplicableRule` never reports `.notApplicable`.** Its own body maps that constructor to
`none` before the `some` is built, so a reported triple always carries a result the engine can act
on. Needed because `expandOnceNoFresh` has a *second* route to `.saturated` — its `.notApplicable`
arm — and the inversion below has to rule that route out rather than assume it dead. -/

/-- **The `.saturated` verdict inverts to "the label-free filter rejected everything".**

`expandOnceNoFresh` reports `.saturated` in two ways: its `pick` found nothing, or the pick's result
was `.notApplicable`. The second is unreachable
(`findApplicableRule_result_ne_notApplicable`), so `.saturated` means exactly that every formula on
the branch was either not applicable at all, or applicable only through a rule the label-free filter
rejects. -/

/-- **The core lemma.** `.saturated` plus no unblocked fresh work **is** settlement.

If `expandOnceNoFresh` reports `.saturated` then every formula on the branch is either not
applicable at all or applicable only through a label-minting or constraint-lengthening rule
(`expandOnceNoFresh_saturated_imp`). `NoUnblockedFreshWork` rules out the second and third
possibilities at every unblocked time. So every unblocked formula has `findApplicableRule = none`,
i.e. is `isExpanded`, and the blocking-aware finder closes.

Each hypothesis pays for exactly one of the two disagreements Phase 2 exhibits:
`LabelFreeSaturatedExit` pays for the fuel-truncation gap (`saturateBlocked` may hand a branch back
untested), and `NoUnblockedFreshWork` pays for the label-minting gap (`expandOnceNoFresh` skips what
`findUnexpandedUnblockedWith` counts). -/

/-- **The repaired residual is not a residual at all: it is a theorem.**

`PostBlockingSettlesAt fc` holds outright, for every frame class, with no hypothesis and no witness
class. This is the honest resolution of `PostBlockingSettles`'s open question: the settlement test is
decided by the **branch** — whether the label-free pass ran to completion on it, and whether any
label-minting work is left at an unblocked time — and not by the fuel. Neither fact follows from
`saturateBlocked`'s exit equation, which is why the literal predicate is false and why this one is
true. -/
theorem postBlockingSettlesAt_holds (fc : FormalSystem.ProofSystem.FrameClass) :
    PostBlockingSettlesAt fc :=
  fun _ _ _ _ _ _ hlf hnf => postBlockingSettlesAt_settlement hlf hnf


/-! ### The gate's verdict, decided

The two bridges are the anti-weakening gate: the repair is admissible only if
`armSettlement_of_postBlockingSettles` and `buildTableauAt_isSome_of_settles` can supply the
relocated hypotheses where they consume the residual. They cannot, and the failure is now decidable
rather than merely observed.

Both sites hold exactly one fact about the output pair — the exit equation — and
`labelFreeSaturatedExit_not_of_saturateBlocked_inr` shows that equation does not carry
`LabelFreeSaturatedExit`. The remaining question is whether a bridge could carry the two antecedents
as an *extra hypothesis* instead. It can, syntactically, and the hypothesis it would carry is
`PostBlockingExitSettled` below — which is **refuted**. So the only bridge shape that typechecks is a
weakening dressed as a repair, and the gate rejects it. That is the finding, stated as a theorem
rather than as a judgement call.
-/

/-- **The hypothesis a bridge at the repaired predicate would have to carry**: that
`saturateBlocked`'s open exit always lands on a branch satisfying both relocated antecedents. -/
def PostBlockingExitSettled (fc : FormalSystem.ProofSystem.FrameClass) : Prop :=
  ∀ (ob : Branch) (oOrd : TimeOrdering) (fuel : Nat) (satBr : Branch) (satOrd : TimeOrdering),
    saturateBlocked ob fuel oOrd fc = some (.inr (satBr, satOrd)) →
    LabelFreeSaturatedExit satBr satOrd fc ∧ NoUnblockedFreshWork satBr satOrd fc

/-- Supplying the antecedents at every exit recovers the literal residual, through the settlement
lemma. This is the implication that makes the refutation below possible. -/
theorem postBlockingSettles_of_postBlockingExitSettled
    {fc : FormalSystem.ProofSystem.FrameClass} (h : PostBlockingExitSettled fc) :
    PostBlockingSettles fc := fun ob oOrd fuel satBr satOrd hsb =>
  postBlockingSettlesAt_settlement (h ob oOrd fuel satBr satOrd hsb).1
    (h ob oOrd fuel satBr satOrd hsb).2

/-- **Gate verdict: FALSE, and provably so.** The bridge hypothesis is refuted at every frame class,
because it implies the literal residual that `postBlockingSettles_fuel_zero_false` refutes.

So the pre-declared repair is not admissible: relocating the two conditions to the output branch
leaves the terminus needing them at a site that cannot produce them, and the one way to hand them to
it carries an antecedent no caller can discharge — the `mintPaysForTime_empty` /
`universeClosed_identify_empty` failure mode in its sharpest form, caught before anything was
restated against it.

The repair is not thereby worthless: `postBlockingSettlesAt_holds` says the relocated statement is
**true outright**, which is what identifies where the real residual lives. It is not a settlement
question at all. It is the conjunction of a *fuel-adequacy* fact — that the pass ran to label-free
saturation rather than being truncated — and a *label-minting* fact about the branch the run reaches,
and neither is available from `saturateBlocked`'s exit equation because both are false at the
`fuel = 0` exit. Any admissible repair must therefore restrict the residual's quantification from
"every `(ob, oOrd, fuel)`" to the pair the terminus's own run produces; that is named here and
deliberately left unattempted. -/
theorem postBlockingExitSettled_false (fc : FormalSystem.ProofSystem.FrameClass) :
    ¬ PostBlockingExitSettled fc :=
  fun h => postBlockingSettles_fuel_zero_false fc
    (postBlockingSettles_of_postBlockingExitSettled h)


/-! ### How far the discharge goes

Two questions, kept apart because conflating them is how a weakening gets mistaken for a repair.
**Is the settlement lemma's antecedent pair dischargeable at a class the engine reaches?** Yes, and
the witness below is a branch the post-blocking pass itself produces. **Is that class larger than
the class where the conclusion already holds?** No — and that is the sharp statement of why
`PostBlockingSettlesAt` is a theorem rather than a repair.
-/

/-- **The converse, unconditional.** A branch on which the settlement test already closes satisfies
`NoUnblockedFreshWork` for free, because the antecedent of that condition is then unsatisfiable: no
unblocked formula has an applicable rule at all. No hypothesis about `expandOnceNoFresh` is used. -/
theorem noUnblockedFreshWork_of_settled
    {b : Branch} {ord : TimeOrdering} {fc : FormalSystem.ProofSystem.FrameClass}
    (h : findUnexpandedUnblockedWith b ord fc (blockedTimes b ord fc (armTracker b)) = none) :
    NoUnblockedFreshWork b ord fc := by
  intro sf hsf hub rule result newOrd hr
  exfalso
  rw [findUnexpandedUnblockedWith, List.find?_eq_none] at h
  refine h sf hsf ?_
  simp only [Bool.and_eq_true, Bool.not_eq_true', isExpanded, hr, Option.isNone_some]
  exact ⟨by simpa using hub, trivial⟩

/-- **The equivalence, and the verdict it carries.** Given that the pass ran to label-free
saturation, `NoUnblockedFreshWork` is not a weaker condition than the settlement test — it is that
test, restated. Forward is `postBlockingSettlesAt_settlement`; backward is the unconditional
converse above.

So `PostBlockingSettlesAt` is a theorem for a reason a reader should not mistake for progress: its
second antecedent already says what its conclusion says, once its first antecedent holds. What the
pair *does* buy is a **branch-independent** sufficient condition — `LabelFreeUniverseAt` below is
checkable from the universe alone, without looking at the branch — and that is the only useful
direction the equivalence leaves open. -/

/-- **The label-minting-free fragment**, stated at a fixed ordering because the ordering is part of
what decides it: `orderTrichotomy` is applicable to *every* signed formula and is
constraint-lengthening exactly when the ordering has an incomparable pair, so no condition on the
formula stock alone can be sufficient. At `TimeOrdering.empty` it reports `.notApplicable`, which is
why the concrete witness below runs there. -/

/-! ### The narrowed repair: the residual at what the terminus instantiates it at

The gate above rejects the *output-branch* repair. What is left is the over-quantification itself,
and that is repairable by the same move every sibling residual on this terminus was repaired by:
state the predicate at what the terminus actually instantiates it at, and fix the direction with a
lemma. `UniverseClosedAt` restricts clause 2's merge target to `b.knownTimes` (entry 10);
`MintPaysForTimeStable` and `MintPaysForTimeFixed` restrict σ (entries 19, 20); and — closest of
all — `ArmSettlement` is *already* stated this way, and says so on its own docstring: "a blanket
'`resolveOpenArm` never reports `none`' is plainly false — at `fuel = 0` and an unsaturated arm it
reports `none` — so this predicate is restricted to arms an engine run actually hands the fold."

`PostBlockingSettles` was never restricted that way, and that is the whole of its defect. It
quantifies over **every** `(ob, oOrd, fuel)`, including branches no run produces and the `fuel = 0`
arm at which its hypothesis is satisfied by every branch whatsoever. `buildTableauAt` reaches it at
exactly one kind of pair: a branch `expandBranchWithFuel` returned open, and the same fuel figure
that call was given.

Nothing here withdraws anything. `PostBlockingSettles` is retained verbatim, the landed termini are
untouched, and the restatements below are additive siblings carrying `ArmSettlement` — which the
landed chain already needed and already had — together with the narrowed residual.
-/

/-- **The post-blocking settlement residual, at what the terminus instantiates it at.**

`PostBlockingSettles`'s statement with the pass's input branch restricted to a branch some
`expandBranchWithFuel` call returned open, at the **same** fuel figure that call was given — which
is exactly how `buildTableauAt` reaches it (`Saturation.lean`'s `buildTableauAt`: one
`expandBranchWithFuel … fuel …` call, then `saturateBlocked openBr fuel ord fc`). The conclusion is
carried over verbatim: no test is weakened, no finder is replaced, and the frame class stays
universally quantified.

**Why the unrestricted form is not used.** It is refuted, at every frame class, and register entry
22 records why: `postBlockingSettles_fuel_zero_false` kills it at the `fuel = 0` arm, where
`saturateBlocked` hands its input back untested so the hypothesis is satisfied at *every* branch,
and `postBlockingSettles_fuel_gap_false` kills it at a nonzero one, on a branch
(`freshWorldBranch`) that no engine run hands to the pass. Entry 23 records why relocating
conditions onto the pass's **output** branch is not the repair either.

**The quantification is the honest one**, in the same sense and the same words as `ArmSettlement`:
`ob` is a branch some `expandBranchWithFuel` call returned open, and the fuel is that call's own.
Whether the predicate holds at the terminus's fuel figure is open; nothing here decides it in
either direction, and it is a hypothesis everywhere it appears. What *is* decided is that the
`fuel = 0` degeneracy which refutes the unrestricted form cannot reach this one
(`expandBranchWithFuel_eq_none_zero`), and that its antecedent is genuinely satisfiable at figures
the engine reaches — see the non-vacuity subsection below. -/
def PostBlockingSettlesRun (fc : FormalSystem.ProofSystem.FrameClass) (fuel : Nat) : Prop :=
  ∀ (b ob : Branch) (ord oOrd : TimeOrdering) (tr : EventualityTracker) (ap oAp : AppliedSet)
    (mb bu : Nat) (satBr : Branch) (satOrd : TimeOrdering),
    expandBranchWithFuel b fuel ord fc tr ap mb bu = some (.inr (ob, oOrd, oAp)) →
    saturateBlocked ob fuel oOrd fc = some (.inr (satBr, satOrd)) →
    findUnexpandedUnblockedWith satBr satOrd fc
      (blockedTimes satBr satOrd fc (armTracker satBr)) = none

/-- **The direction, fixed and stated in words.** `PostBlockingSettlesRun fc fuel` is the **weaker**
predicate: its hypothesis list is longer by one antecedent, and the difference sits at the `(ob,
oOrd)` quantifier — the narrowed form speaks only about pairs an `expandBranchWithFuel` call at this
same fuel returned open, where the unrestricted form speaks about all of them. So the implication
runs `PostBlockingSettles fc → PostBlockingSettlesRun fc fuel`, at every `fuel`, and **every
theorem restated against the narrowed form is a strengthening of its landed original**, never a
weakening. This is the same direction `universeClosedAt_of_universeClosed` and
`mintPaysForTimeFixed_of_mintPaysForTimeStable` record for their own repairs, and register entry 7
is why it is stated rather than assumed. -/

/-- **The degeneracy that refutes the unrestricted form cannot reach the narrowed one.** At
`fuel = 0` the narrowed predicate is vacuously true, because `expandBranchWithFuel` reports `none`
there and its antecedent is unsatisfiable — where the unrestricted predicate is *false* at that
same figure, since `saturateBlocked` hands its input back untested and the hypothesis is then
satisfied at every branch.

Stated so the fuel parameter is visibly load-bearing rather than decoration: at `fuel = 0` the
narrowed predicate says nothing at all, so a discharge has to be claimed at a figure where its
antecedent is satisfiable. The non-vacuity subsection below exhibits such figures. -/

/-! #### The termini, restated at the narrowed residual

One hypothesis is exchanged and one is made explicit. `PostBlockingSettles fc` supplied **two**
things to the landed termini — `ArmSettlement fc`, through `armSettlement_of_postBlockingSettles`,
for `expandBranchWithFuel`'s split folds, and the entry point's own post-blocking arm. The
narrowed residual covers only the second, so `ArmSettlement` is now named in the hypothesis list
instead of being manufactured from a refuted predicate. That is a strict improvement and not a new
cost: `ArmSettlement` is a landed residual of this file, is *already* quantified the honest way, and
was always what the fold consumed.

**Every restatement is a strengthening of its landed original**, and this is proved rather than
asserted: `buildTableauAt_isSome_of_budget_of_run` re-derives the landed statement from the
restated one, using `armSettlement_of_postBlockingSettles` and
`postBlockingSettlesRun_of_postBlockingSettles` to supply the two hypotheses from the single one.

**It costs no figure.** `mintAwareFuel`, `mintAwareFuelAt`, `derivedTmax`, `derivedTmaxAt`,
`budgetPotentialAt` and `mintPathBoundAt` are reused byte for byte; the fuel expression in each
restatement is the one already in its original's conclusion, and the narrowed residual is
instantiated at exactly that expression.

The landed termini are retained verbatim, because nothing in this file is withdrawn.

/-! #### Non-vacuity of the narrowed residual

The refutation of the unrestricted form turns on `fuel = 0` making its hypothesis hold at every
branch while carrying no information. A narrowed predicate that were true only because its
restricted antecedent is never satisfied would repeat that failure one level down, so the antecedent
is exhibited holding on runs the terminus actually produces.

Two things are shown, and they are shown by different means, which is stated rather than blurred.

**(a) The pass does real work, proved.** `saturateBlocked_multBranch_one_run` decides — at every
frame class and every positive fuel — that the post-blocking pass started at `[F(p → q)@⟨0,0⟩]`
returns a strictly longer branch, and `postBlockingSettlesAt_labelFree` is the settlement delivered
there. So the residual's conclusion is an obligation about a branch the pass built, never a no-op on
its input.

**(b) The full antecedent is satisfied by seed runs, measured.** The probe below runs the terminus's
own two calls in sequence — `expandBranchWithFuel` from the seed at a fuel figure, then
`saturateBlocked` on its open exit at that same figure — and reports three booleans: the run reached
an open exit, the pass strictly extended it, and the settlement test closed on the result. All three
are `true` at every frame class, on a propositional seed and a temporal one.

This half is a **checked measurement, not a kernel proof**, and the reason is worth stating so a
reader does not mistake one for the other: `expandBranchWithFuel` is compiled by well-founded
recursion and does not reduce definitionally, so a proof of the first equation would require
transcribing its eleven-formula open exit and unfolding the equation lemma once per engine step.
`#guard_msgs` makes the measurement a build-time obligation — the probe's value is checked by
`lake build` — which is the same standing `branchingWitness`'s non-vacuity `#eval` has in section
C7 above, and it is recorded with the same honesty about what it is.

**What the probe did not find.** Across fourteen formula shapes, four frame classes and three fuel
figures, no run made the settlement test fail — so no counterexample to the narrowed residual was
found, at any figure probed. That is evidence and not a proof, and the residual is carried as a
hypothesis accordingly. The same sweep also found `buildTableauAt`'s own guard never firing on those
shapes: the threaded tracker and the recomputed `armTracker` agreed everywhere, so the entry point
did not consult its post-blocking arm on any of them. The residual is therefore live but not yet
exercised by a probed formula, which is a fact about the probe's reach, not about the residual. -/

non-vacuity claim (a). -/
theorem multBranch_one_length_lt_multSettledBranch :
    (multBranch 1).length < multSettledBranch.length := by decide


/-! #### The verdict on the narrowed residual: **FALSE**, at the terminus's own fuel figure

Task 433's narrowing restricted `(ob, oOrd, fuel)` to a pair some `expandBranchWithFuel` call at
this same fuel returned open. It did **not** restrict the run's other inputs, and one of them is not
inert: the `EventualityTracker` argument `tr`. The two blocked-set computations that the residual
needs to agree — `blockedTimes b ord fc tracker'` inside `expandOnceUnblocked`, where
`tracker' = fulfillEventualities b (registerEventualities b tr)`, and
`blockedTimes satBr satOrd fc (armTracker satBr)`, where `armTracker` re-seeds from
`EventualityTracker.empty` — share their branch, their ordering and their frame class, and differ in
**exactly** the tracker seed.

Blocking is *monotone in pending entries at the ancestor*: `isTemporallyBlockedSaturated` conjoins
`allEventualitiesFulfilledOrDuplicated`, which asks that every eventuality pending at `t` have some
pending entry with the same event formula and the same `isUntil` flag at the ancestor time. Adding a
pending entry at the ancestor therefore makes blocking fire *more* often, so a doctored `tr` yields a
**strictly larger** blocked set than the settlement test's recomputed `armTracker`: the engine skips
a time the settlement test still inspects. Two further facts make the exploit reachable —
`fulfillEventualities` discharges a pending entry only when its event formula occurs positively at
the entry's own **world** at some other time, so an entry parked at an otherwise-unused world is
never discharged; and `Branch.timeType`'s subset test ignores the world component, so the subset half
of blocking is satisfied across worlds while fulfillment, which is world-sensitive, is not.

**The predicate as written quantifies over `tr`, so the predicate as written is false.** This is
stated in the same voice as register entry 22's `fuel = 0` degeneracy, and it is not softened to a
caveat: the finding is that the narrowing was *incomplete*, and the completion is named below
(`PostBlockingSettlesSeedRun`) — carried as a hypothesis, never discharged.

**Why this refutation is a kernel proof where entry 24 records the positive direction as
prohibitive.** Entry 24 is right that `expandBranchWithFuel` is compiled by well-founded recursion
and does not reduce definitionally, so *proving* its half of the antecedent would mean transcribing
an engine exit and unfolding the equation lemma once per engine step. The witness below is returned
at the **first** step — the run reports `.saturated` immediately — so a single `rw` through the
equation lemma reaches the `.saturated` arm and the obligation closes. No engine step is
transcribed. That is the whole qualitative gain over a `#guard_msgs` measurement, and it is why the
verdict here is a theorem rather than an observation.
-/

/-- The witness branch: the verbatim open exit `expandBranchWithFuel` produces from
`seedBranch (p → q)` at `.Base` (its last eleven formulas, times chained `2 < 0 < 1 < 3`, engine
blocked set `[3, 2]`), augmented with world-1 machinery, the two `negPos` conclusions that exit left
outstanding at its blocked times, and the witness formula `T(p untl q)@⟨9,4⟩`.

Every part of the shape is load-bearing, and none of it is decoration:

* the tail is an **engine exit taken verbatim**, so the ancestor times are genuinely
  engine-saturated rather than hand-asserted — that is what makes `expandOnceNoFresh`'s `.saturated`
  verdict below honest instead of arranged;
* the world-1 block puts `T(p untl q)` into the ancestor's time type already expanded and fulfilled,
  which is what lets the duplication half of blocking be satisfied at time 4;
* `T(p untl q)@⟨9,4⟩` is the witness itself: `untlPos` mints a time, so `expandOnceNoFresh` skips it
  (`ruleMintsFreshTime`), and the post-blocking pass is by construction unable to remove it. -/

Both halves of that placement are load-bearing. The *time* is 0, which is the ancestor time
`allEventualitiesFulfilledOrDuplicated` consults for the pending `q`-eventuality that
`registerEventualities` derives from `T(p untl q)@⟨9,4⟩`, so the duplication test is satisfied and
time 4 joins the blocked set. The *world* is unused, so `fulfillEventualities` — which discharges an
entry only on finding `T q` at that entry's own world at some other time — never removes it. This
tracker is not one any engine run threads, and that is not a defect in the refutation: the residual
quantifies over the tracker, so a tracker it admits is a counterexample to it. -/

`.saturated` **immediately**, so `rw [expandBranchWithFuel]` unfolds the equation lemma exactly

`PostBlockingSettlesRun` does not hold at the terminus's own fuel figure, at `.Base`, for **any**
values of the parameters — the figure is always at least one, and the predicate is refuted at every
positive figure.

**The consequence, stated without hedging.** `buildTableauAt_isSome_of_budget_fixed_run` and its five
`_run` siblings carry `PostBlockingSettlesRun fc (mintAwareFuelAt …)` as a hypothesis. At `.Base`
(and, by `postBlockingSettlesRun_false_dense` / `postBlockingSettlesRun_false_rtime`, at `.Dense` and
`.RTime`) that hypothesis is **false**: those statements are vacuous there, not merely unproved.
Nothing is withdrawn on that account — they remain exactly as true as they ever were — but a reader
must not read them as delivering `buildTableauAt … .isSome` at those classes. This is the analogue
of `postBlockingExitSettled_false`, and it sits beside it in spirit: a residual decided in the
negative, recorded as a theorem rather than left to be inferred.

/-! ## D3. The residual, discharged at a **nonempty** universe: the `untl`/`snce`-free fragment

**What this section delivers.** `MintPaysForTime fc U Tmax` — the predicate this file started from,
not a repair of it — proved outright, at every frame class and every `Tmax`, for every universe
whose formulas carry no `untl` and no `snce` node. Section D2 left the predicate discharged only at
`U = ∅` (`mintPaysForTime_empty`); this section moves the boundary off the empty universe and onto a
syntactic condition that a genuinely nonempty stock satisfies — in particular the whole **modal
fragment**: atoms, `⊥`, `→`, `□`, and everything built from them, which is `S5` over a single
moment sitting inside the bimodal language.

**Why the two blockers section D2 records do not bite here.** They are both blockers on a *time
mint*, and in this fragment no time is ever minted at all:

* *The engine-level assembly.* D2's residual blocker needs the picked rule's identity threaded to
  the successor so a **per-rule payment** (disjunct 2 or 3) can be cashed there. Here no payment is
  ever needed: the argument runs entirely in disjunct 1, and disjunct 1 is uniform in the rule. All
  the pick has to supply is the *negative* fact `ruleMintsFreshTime r = false`, which
  `pick_stage_source_noMint` reads straight off `isApplicable` without destructuring a single rule
  arm.
* *The density coordinate.* `densityRule` is the rule register entries 17 and 20 name as reachable
  by no disjunct for any `σ` whatsoever. It is nonetheless harmless here, and for a reason that is
  worth stating because it is not the frame-class gate: `isApplicable .densityRule sf fc` requires
  `sf.formula` to match `.allFuture _`, and `Formula.allFuture φ` is
  `((⊥ → ⊥) untl (φ → ⊥)) → ⊥` — an `untl` node. So the shape gate rejects it before the
  `Dense ≤ fc` gate is ever consulted, and the discharge below carries **no frame-class
  restriction**. That is strictly better than the "every frame class except `.Dense`/`.RTime`"
  outcome D2's blocker anticipated.

**The shape of the argument, in one line.** Every one of the nine members of `freshTimeRules` is
gated by `isApplicable` on a formula shape that contains an `untl` or an `snce` node
(`allFutureNeg`, `allPastNeg`, `densityRule` through the `allFuture`/`allPast` abbreviations;
`someFuturePos`, `somePastPos`, `untlPos`, `sncePos`, `untlNeg`, `snceNeg` through their `as…?`
views). The engine's other two stages run exactly one rule each — `serialityRule` and
`timeLinearity` — and neither is in the census. So on an `untl`/`snce`-free branch the picked rule
never mints, `applyRule_emitted_time_mem` applies at every emission, and the successor's known
times are a subset of the predecessor's. Both of disjunct 1's conjuncts follow: the cardinality
directly, and the rank because `splitOrderedRank` is monotone in `knownTimes` and antitone in the
constraint list, which `expandOnceUnblocked_ord_mono` only ever extends.

**What this is not.** It is not a discharge at a universe containing a temporal operator, and it
cannot be turned into one: `mintPaysForTime_untlNeg_false` refutes the predicate at a universe whose
formulas are `untl`-headed, so the syntactic condition below is not removable. The two named next
steps of register entry 20 stand unchanged for the temporal fragment. -/

/-- **The syntactic condition**: no `untl` and no `snce` node anywhere in the formula.

Stated on the raw constructors rather than on the `as…?` views, so it is manifestly closed under
subformulas and manifestly satisfied by the modal fragment. It is *sufficient* rather than
necessary — `asUntil?` also rejects `untl ⊤ φ`, and `isApplicable` rejects some shapes this
predicate admits — and sufficiency is all the discharge needs. -/

/-! ### The time sweep with `OrdTimesKnown` traded for branch-level freeness

`applyRule_emitted_time_mem` (section D1) carries `OrdTimesKnown b ord`, and
`applyRule_emitted_time_mem_ordTimesKnown_needed` decides that the *unconditional* statement is
false. Neither fact settles what happens on this section's fragment, and the difference matters
downstream: `UniverseClosedAt`'s clause 1 hands over `∀ x ∈ b, x ∈ signedUniverse C L`, from which
branch-level `untlSnceFree` follows in one line, but it hands over nothing at all about the
ordering. A statement whose only currency is branch-level freeness therefore reaches sites the
`OrdTimesKnown` form cannot.

`haux` is consumed at exactly three closer families in the D1 sweep —
`mem_filterMap_futureOf_time haux`, `mem_filterMap_pastOf_time haux`, and (through
`applyRule_orderTrichotomy_emitted_time`) `mem_knownTimes_of_mem_pastOf haux` — spread across
exactly five rule arms. All five are shape-gated, and the five lemmas below say so one arm at a
time. Four are gated by the *trigger*: `.allFuturePos` and `.allPastPos` match the raw
`Formula.allFuture` / `Formula.allPast` shape, whose head is an `untl` / `snce` node, and
`.someFutureNeg` / `.somePastNeg` consult `asSomeFuture?` / `asSomePast?`, which the view lemmas
above already return `none` for. The fifth is gated by the *branch*: `.orderTrichotomy`'s `fires`
guard demands `branch.contains (SignedFormula.neg d l0)` for one of three `Formula.someFuture`-headed
disjuncts, and an `untl`/`snce`-free branch carries no `untl`-headed formula at all. That asymmetry
is why the restricted sweep takes a branch-level hypothesis rather than a trigger-level one.

Each exclusion concludes `emitted = []` rather than the weaker "every emission is at a known time":
on this fragment the four propagation arms and the trichotomy arm do not merely emit safely, they
do not fire. -/

/-- `.allFuturePos` does not fire on an `untl`/`snce`-free trigger. Its arm matches the raw shape
`Formula.allFuture ψ = ((⊥ → ⊥) untl (ψ → ⊥)) → ⊥`, so the condition has to be pushed through the
implication before the `untl` node is visible — the same extra split
`asAllFuture_eq_none_of_untlSnceFree` needs, and for the same reason. Routing through that view
lemma is not available here: `applyRule`'s arm is a constructor pattern, not a view. -/

`Formula.someFuture (…) = Formula.untl ⊤ (…)`. So no candidate fires, `candidates.find? fires` is
`none`, and the arm reports `.notApplicable`.

This is the arm the trigger-level hypothesis does not reach: nothing about `sf`'s own shape
constrains what the branch carries, which is why the restricted sweep below takes `hbfree`. -/

/-- **The time sweep on the `untl`/`snce`-free fragment, without `OrdTimesKnown`.**

`applyRule_emitted_time_mem` with `haux : OrdTimesKnown b ord` replaced by
`hbfree : ∀ x ∈ b, untlSnceFree x.formula = true`. Three things about it, and no more:

* **It is incomparable to the original, not stronger.** It trades a semantic run invariant for a
  syntactic branch condition. Neither hypothesis implies the other: an ordering can be
  `OrdTimesKnown` over a branch carrying `untl` formulas, and an `untl`/`snce`-free branch can sit
  under an ordering reaching times it does not know. Both statements are needed, and both are kept.
* **It does not contradict `applyRule_emitted_time_mem_ordTimesKnown_needed`.** What that theorem
  refutes is the *unconditional* statement — no `OrdTimesKnown`, no syntactic condition, nothing.
  Its witness branch is `[T(G p)]`, and `Formula.allFuture p` is an `untl` node, so the witness
  fails `hbfree` outright. The refutation stands exactly as stated.
* **The five arms that consume `OrdTimesKnown` are precisely the five the syntactic hypothesis
  shape-gates**: `.allFuturePos` and `.allPastPos` (raw `allFuture` / `allPast` constructor
  patterns), `.someFutureNeg` and `.somePastNeg` (the `asSomeFuture?` / `asSomePast?` views), and
  `.orderTrichotomy` (the `fires` guard's branch lookup). The five exclusions above are inserted
  into the sweep's `first` chain *ahead of* the closers that would have needed `haux`, and the
  `mem_filterMap_futureOf_time` / `mem_filterMap_pastOf_time` alternatives are then simply absent:
  no arm reaches them. Every other arm is closed by the D1 sweep's own `haux`-free alternatives,
  copied verbatim so that the ordering property that script's docstring records — every closer a
  backtrackable `refine … ?_`, never a term-level `by` that could absorb a failing goal into
  `sorryAx` — is preserved.

`hmint : ruleMintsFreshTime rule = false` is retained. It is plausibly droppable on this fragment,
since an `untl`/`snce`-free trigger fails every minting rule's shape view
(`isApplicable_eq_false_of_untlSnceFree`), but `applyRule` is not gated by `isApplicable`, so
dropping it is a separate proof and not one this statement needs. -/

is not economy — the original's `haux` is available at every site that currently consumes it, via
`hri.ordTimesKnown` — but *reachability*: `UniverseClosedAt`'s clause 1 quantifies `ord` universally
and unconstrained, so it can never supply `OrdTimesKnown b ord`, while branch-level freeness follows
from clause 1's own `∀ x ∈ b, x ∈ signedUniverse C L` in one line.

The original is retained with its signature byte-identical and its proof untouched: it is cited by

condition. -/

/-- **Seed-level terminus 2, with the mint residual discharged rather than assumed.**

The exact statement of `buildTableauAt_isSome_at_seed_lengthBudget_signedUniverse_fixed` with its
`hmint` argument gone: on an `untl`/`snce`-free stock the hypothesis is a theorem, so the terminus
carries one named residual fewer. The other three (`UnorderedSuccessorLabelClosed`,
`StepLengthBounded`, `PostBlockingSettles`) are untouched — this section says nothing about them.

**But read the reach honestly: `hlab` makes this statement vacuous wherever the universe is not
empty.** The section heading promises a discharge "at a **nonempty** universe", and the `hmint`
half of that promise is kept. The `hlab` half is not, and cannot be:
`unorderedSuccessorLabelClosed_nonempty_false` refutes `hlab` at every nonempty finite `L`, so at
exactly the `L` this section is interested in, the theorem above is a true conditional with a false
antecedent. It is the failure mode `DifficultyBounded` fell into and that `timeMergeClosed_product`
was added to rule out — a residual nobody can satisfy makes its theorem a true conditional with no
reach. What removes `hlab` is not a better proof of this theorem but a **replacement** for the
predicate — a condition that is actually satisfiable at a nonempty `L`. No artifact should read this
theorem, or any of the eight siblings that carry `hlab`, as claiming a discharge at a nonempty
universe until `hlab` is absent from the signature. -/

/-! ## D4. The label residual, **replaced**: the `boxFree` shape gate and the world coordinate

**What this section delivers.** A route to clause 1 at `signedUniverse C L`, and to a seed-level
terminus, that carries **no** `UnorderedSuccessorLabelClosed` hypothesis at all. Section C11 proves
that residual false at every nonempty finite `L` (`unorderedSuccessorLabelClosed_nonempty_false`),
so the nine theorems that assume it are vacuously true at exactly the universes anyone cares about.
A *discharge* of it is therefore not available and never was — it is not a hard lemma, it is a false
statement. What is available is a **replacement**: a different hypothesis, satisfiable at a nonempty
`L` and discharged rather than assumed, bought at the price of a syntactic restriction on the stock.

**Why the replacement has to bite on the stock and not on `L`.** `freshWorldHeadroom_not_universal`
proves that for no nonempty finite `L` does every `L`-confined branch have the headroom: each
enlargement of `L` raises the reachable `maxWorld` at least as much as it adds, so the gap re-opens.
Every `L`-side repair is refuted before it is written. The one remaining place to intervene is
**before the world-minting rules can fire at all**, and that means a condition on the formulas a
branch may carry.

**Why exactly two rules have to be stopped.** `applyRule_emitted_world_mem` bounds the worlds a rule
emits at by `b.worldFinset` under exactly two hypotheses, `rule ≠ .boxNeg` and `rule ≠ .diamondPos`.
Those two inequalities *are* the world-minting census — there is no third rule, and if there were,
`findApplicableRule_not_worldMinting`'s conclusion below would be incomplete rather than merely
weak. `boxFree` closes both at the **shape gate**: `.boxNeg` is gated by `isApplicable`'s
`| .boxNeg, .neg, .box _ => true` arm, and `.diamondPos` by `asDiamond? φ`, whose only matching
pattern is itself built from a `.box` node. A branch carrying no `.box` anywhere can have neither
picked, at any frame class and any tracker.

**No frame-class restriction, for the same structural reason as D3.** The exclusion happens at the
shape gate, before `isApplicable` consults any `fc`-dependent gate, so nothing in this section
quantifies `fc` away or restricts it.

**What this is not — read this before citing anything below.** The terminus this section builds
combines `boxFree` with D3's `untlSnceFree`, and the two together collapse the stock to the **purely
propositional fragment**: atoms, `⊥`, `→`, and nothing else. That is a severe narrowing, and it is
**forced rather than a proof weakness**. `freshWorldHeadroom_not_universal` rules out every `L`-side
alternative, so the only handle is the stock; and stopping `.boxNeg` and `.diamondPos` at the stock
means excluding `□` outright, since both are gated on a `.box` node. No artifact may read this
section as a discharge over the modal fragment, as a general discharge, or as superseding D3's
reach: D3's `MintPaysForTime` result covers the whole modal fragment **including** `□`, and this
section does not. What this section adds is orthogonal to D3 — it removes a *false* hypothesis from
a terminus, at the one fragment where removing it is possible. -/

/-- **The syntactic condition**: no `.box` node anywhere in the formula.

Stated on the raw constructors rather than on the `asDiamond?` view, for the same reason
`untlSnceFree` is: it is then manifestly closed under subformulas and manifestly checkable on a
concrete stock by `rfl`. Like `untlSnceFree` it is *sufficient* rather than necessary — `asDiamond?`
also rejects `.box`-bearing shapes this predicate excludes outright — and sufficiency is all the
replacement needs. -/

  | .snce a b => boxFree a && boxFree b

/-- **The `◇` view is empty on a `boxFree` formula.** `asDiamond? φ` matches only the shape whose
body is a `.box` node, so a formula with no `.box` anywhere cannot present as a diamond. This is the
half of the census that is *not* visible from `isApplicable`'s own pattern match, which is why it is
stated separately. -/

/-- **The first stage cannot pick a world-minting rule on a `boxFree` trigger.** The world-coordinate
counterpart of `findApplicableRule_not_mintsFreshTime`, and the fact `pick_stage_source_noWorldMint`
threads to the successor.

The conclusion is stated as the pair of inequalities `applyRule_emitted_world_mem` asks for, rather
than as a `ruleMintsFreshLabel` fact, because that lemma's hypotheses are the authoritative census:
`.boxNeg` and `.diamondPos` are the only two rules that can emit outside `b.worldFinset`, and both
are gated on a `.box` node — the first by `isApplicable`'s own pattern, the second through
`asDiamond?`. This is the structural reason the whole route carries no frame-class restriction: the
shape gate is consulted before any `fc`-dependent gate. -/

/-! ### The world-subset machinery, mirroring D3's time machinery

Three declarations, in the same order and the same shapes as `pick_stage_source_noMint`,
`pickBranches_knownTimes_subset` and `unorderedSuccessor_knownTimes_subset`. The mirror is
**strictly simpler than its template** in one respect worth naming rather than leaving a reader to
wonder about: `applyRule_emitted_world_mem` carries no `OrdTimesKnown b ord` hypothesis where
`applyRule_emitted_time_mem` does, so none of the three below takes one either. The asymmetry is
real and is recorded at `applyRule_emitted_time_mem_ordTimesKnown_needed`: the time sweep needs the
ordering's times to be branch-known because `timeLinearity` reads times off `ord`, whereas nothing
reads *worlds* off the ordering at all.

**Footnote, added later.** The asymmetry is real but it is not permanent on this fragment:
`unorderedSuccessor_knownTimes_subset_of_untlSnceFree` (section D3) is the time-coordinate mirror
without the run invariant, and the boundary block at the end of this section records what that
buys. -/

/-- **`pick_stage_source` with the no-world-mint fact attached**, the world-coordinate counterpart
of `pick_stage_source_noMint`. The three stages differ only in how the fact arrives: stage one has
it from `findApplicableRule_not_worldMinting`; stages two and three run exactly one rule each
(`serialityRule` via `findApplicableSerialRule_rule`, `timeLinearity` via
`findApplicableLinearityRule_rule`), and neither is `.boxNeg` or `.diamondPos`, so both close on the
rule identity alone. -/

/-! ### The composite: clause 1's label dimension at the propositional fragment

The two per-coordinate subset facts, joined by the rectangle. This is the same assembly as
`unorderedSuccessor_label_mem_of_headroom`, with one decisive difference: there the four quadrants
are paid for by `FreshLabelHeadroom L b`, which `freshLabelHeadroom_not_universal` refutes at every
nonempty finite `L`; here they are paid for by `TimeMergeClosed L`, which `timeMergeClosed_product`
exhibits at every rectangle. The hypothesis is satisfiable, and that is the entire point of the
exercise. -/

/-- **Clause 1's label dimension, discharged from satisfiable hypotheses.** Every formula on every
unordered successor of an `L`-confined `boxFree`, `untl`/`snce`-free branch sits at a label of `L`.

**How the four quadrants are paid for.** A label is a *pair*, and the two coordinate facts arrive
separately: `unorderedSuccessor_worldFinset_subset` puts the successor's world among `b`'s worlds,
`unorderedSuccessor_knownTimes_subset` puts its time among `b`'s times. Confinement of `b` then
supplies a formula `y ∈ b` carrying that world and a formula `z ∈ b` carrying that time, each at a
label in `L` — but `y` and `z` are in general *different* formulas, so `⟨y.label.world, z.label.time⟩`
is a quadrant confinement alone does not reach. That cross-product gap is exactly the one register
entry 21 warns about, and `TimeMergeClosed L` is exactly what closes it:
`timeMergeClosed_iff_product` characterizes a time-merge-closed label set as precisely a full
rectangle of worlds against times, which is the cross-product closure a pair-valued label needs. No
further hypothesis is required, and a reader who expects to have to re-derive the worry can stop
here.

`TimeMergeClosed L` is not new currency either: it is already a sibling hypothesis at every terminus
in the chain, where it discharges `UniverseClosedAt`'s clause 2.

`OrdTimesKnown b ord` is inherited from `unorderedSuccessor_knownTimes_subset` and through it from
`applyRule_emitted_time_mem`, where `applyRule_emitted_time_mem_ordTimesKnown_needed` shows it is not
removable. It is the one hypothesis here that the world coordinate does not need — see the section

/-- **Clause 1 at `signedUniverse C L`, both dimensions, from satisfiable hypotheses.**

The mirror of `unorderedSuccessor_confined_signedUniverse_of_headroom` with its
`UnorderedSuccessorLabelClosed fc L` argument **gone**: the formula coordinate is discharged as
before by `unorderedSuccessor_formula_mem` from `hC`/`hT`, and the label coordinate by
`unorderedSuccessor_label_mem_of_propositional` from the two syntactic conditions and
`TimeMergeClosed L`. Nothing here is assumed that cannot be exhibited — contrast the `_of_headroom`
original, whose `hlab` is false at every nonempty `L`, and the C11 sibling
`unorderedSuccessor_confined_signedUniverse_of_freshLabelHeadroom`, whose `FreshLabelHeadroom L b` is
refutable as a universally quantified condition.

The `_of_headroom` original is retained byte-identical and is what the landed terminus chain
consumes; this is an additional declaration stated beside it, exactly as
`UnorderedSuccessorLabelClosedOrd` is stated beside `UnorderedSuccessorLabelClosed`.

**Note the `OrdTimesKnown b ord` in the quantifier prefix**, which the `_of_headroom` original does
not have and which the C11 `FreshLabelHeadroom` sibling does. It is not decoration, and it is why
this theorem stops here rather than continuing into a restated terminus — see the boundary note

/-- **`UniverseClosedAt fc (signedUniverse C L)` with no residual and no frame-class restriction.**

The theorem section D4's boundary block recorded as *not stateable*. Its hypotheses are two stock
conditions (`TableauClosed C`, `TrichStock C`), the label-set closure condition (`TimeMergeClosed L`,
satisfied by every rectangle — `timeMergeClosed_product`), and the two syntactic shape conditions on
the stock. There is **no** `UnorderedSuccessorLabelClosed`, **no** `OrdTimesKnown`, and **no**
frame-class hypothesis.

Assembled exactly as `universeClosedAt_signedUniverse_of_headroom` is: a two-component anonymous
constructor whose clause 2 is `timeMergeClosed_identifyTime_signedUniverse hL`, unchanged and taking
no argument the `_of_headroom` original does not also give it. Only clause 1 differs, and it is the
`ordFree` composite above.

**It is nevertheless vacuous, for a reason that has nothing to do with `hlab`.** `hC` and `hfree`
are jointly unsatisfiable: `TableauClosed.serialFuture` requires `Formula.top.someFuture ∈ C`, and
`Formula.someFuture ⊤` is `⊤ untl ⊤`, which `untlSnceFree` rejects.
`tableauClosed_untlSnceFree_false` below decides this, and it is stated immediately after this
theorem rather than in a note so that no reader takes the removal of `hlab` for a discharge. The
same collision hits `unorderedSuccessor_confined_signedUniverse_of_propositional` and its `ordFree`
sibling above, and section D3's
`buildTableauAt_isSome_at_seed_lengthBudget_signedUniverse_untlSnceFree`, all of which carry both
hypotheses.

What is *not* hit is anything that takes only the syntactic condition:
`applyRule_emitted_time_mem_of_untlSnceFree`,
`unorderedSuccessor_knownTimes_subset_of_untlSnceFree`,
`unorderedSuccessor_label_mem_of_propositional_ordFree`, and section D3's
`mintPaysForTime_of_untlSnceFree` chain take no `TableauClosed` and are non-vacuous. The collision
is between stock *closure* and stock *shape*, and it is located at exactly one field.

What this does **not** do is restate the terminus. The `_at` / `_selfGuarded` / `_fixed` families and
`buildTableauAt_isSome_at_seed_lengthBudget_signedUniverse_*` are untouched, and removing their
`hlab` is separate, downstream work. See the boundary block below. -/

    fun _ _ _ hbU ht₁ => timeMergeClosed_identifyTime_signedUniverse hL hbU ht₁⟩

/-- **`TableauClosed C` and `∀ φ ∈ C, untlSnceFree φ = true` cannot both hold.** Decided, not
argued, and in one field: `TableauClosed.serialFuture` demands `Formula.top.someFuture ∈ C` —
`serialityRule` emits `T(F⊤)` at every label from no trigger at all, so any stock closed under the
engine's outputs contains it — and `Formula.someFuture ⊤` unfolds to `Formula.untl ⊤ ⊤`, which
`untlSnceFree` rejects by its `untl` arm.

**What this decides, and what it does not.** Every theorem in this file carrying *both* hypotheses is
therefore vacuously true, whatever else its signature says. That is four declarations:
`unorderedSuccessor_confined_signedUniverse_of_propositional` and its `ordFree` sibling,
`universeClosedAt_signedUniverse_of_propositional`, and section D3's
`buildTableauAt_isSome_at_seed_lengthBudget_signedUniverse_untlSnceFree` — the last of which register
entry 21 already records as vacuous through `hlab`, and which is now vacuous twice over and for
independent reasons.

Nothing carrying only the syntactic condition is affected, and that is most of the machinery:
section D3's `applyRule_emitted_time_mem_of_untlSnceFree`,
`unorderedSuccessor_knownTimes_subset_of_untlSnceFree`, `mintPaysForTime_of_untlSnceFree` and its
descendants, and this section's `unorderedSuccessor_label_mem_of_propositional_ordFree` all stand
non-vacuously. Removing `OrdTimesKnown` from the time coordinate was real work with a real result;
what it turns out not to buy is a non-vacuous composite at `signedUniverse C L`.

**Where the obstruction actually sits, for whoever picks this up.** Not in the shape condition and
not in the time coordinate, but in `TableauClosed`'s `serialFuture` / `serialPast` fields, which are
forced by `serialityRule` firing unconditionally at every label. A non-vacuous propositional
composite therefore needs either a weakened stock-closure predicate that does not demand the
seriality outputs — and then a re-derivation of `unorderedSuccessor_formula_mem` at it — or a
syntactic condition weaker than `untlSnceFree` that admits `⊤ untl ⊤` while still excluding the four
propagation arms and `.orderTrichotomy`. Neither is attempted here, and neither is refuted. -/

/-! ### The boundary: what Route 1 turned out to be, and where this section now stops

**An earlier version of this block recorded a shape mismatch as settled and Route 1 as
unattempted. Both halves are now false, and the block is rewritten rather than patched so that no
reader inherits the superseded verdict.** What it said was this: `UniverseClosedAt fc U`'s clause 1
is

  `∀ b ord tr, (∀ x ∈ b, x ∈ U) → ∀ nb ∈ unorderedSuccessorBranches …, ∀ x ∈ nb, x ∈ U`

with `ord` **universally quantified and unconstrained**, while every theorem closing the time
coordinate carried `OrdTimesKnown b ord`, inherited through `unorderedSuccessor_knownTimes_subset`
from `applyRule_emitted_time_mem` — where `applyRule_emitted_time_mem_ordTimesKnown_needed` proves
the hypothesis is not removable. Two routes past it were named: re-derive the time sweep on this
fragment's reachable rules (Route 1), or thread `OrdTimesKnown` through the whole closure interface
(Route 2).

**Route 1 was attempted and it works.** `applyRule_emitted_time_mem_of_untlSnceFree` (section D3)
is the time sweep with `OrdTimesKnown b ord` replaced by `∀ x ∈ b, untlSnceFree x.formula = true`.
The replacement is exact, not approximate: `haux` is consumed at exactly five rule arms, and all
five are shape-gated by that condition —

* `.allFuturePos` and `.allPastPos`, whose `applyRule` arms match the raw `Formula.allFuture` /
  `Formula.allPast` shapes, each headed by an `untl` / `snce` node;
* `.someFutureNeg` and `.somePastNeg`, gated by `asSomeFuture?` / `asSomePast?`, which section D3's
  view lemmas already send to `none`;
* `.orderTrichotomy`, whose `fires` guard demands the branch carry
  `SignedFormula.neg d l0` for one of three `Formula.someFuture`-headed disjuncts.

The first four are excluded by the *trigger's* shape; the fifth is excluded by what the *branch*
carries, which is why the restricted sweep takes a branch-level hypothesis. That asymmetry is also
what makes the route work at all: clause 1 hands over `∀ x ∈ b, x ∈ signedUniverse C L`, from which
branch-level freeness follows in one line, and hands over nothing whatever about `ord`.

**One correction to the superseded block's own reasoning, recorded because it was load-bearing.**
That block conjectured Route 1 would need the pick to be constrained — the linearity stage yielding
`.branchingOrdered`, the seriality stage emitting at the trigger's label, and so on. None of that is
needed. The five exclusions are local to `applyRule`'s arms, no rule set is restricted, and `boxFree`
plays no part in the time coordinate at all: it is what closes the **world** coordinate
(`unorderedSuccessor_worldFinset_subset`), and the restricted sweep carries one syntactic hypothesis
rather than two.

**What the section now delivers.** `universeClosedAt_signedUniverse_of_propositional`:
`UniverseClosedAt fc (signedUniverse C L)` from `TableauClosed C`, `TrichStock C`,
`TimeMergeClosed L`, and the two shape conditions — with no `UnorderedSuccessorLabelClosed`, no
`OrdTimesKnown`, and no frame-class restriction. It is the statement this block previously recorded
as not stateable, and it is now stated and proved.

**And it is vacuous — a second obstruction, found only once the first was removed.**
`tableauClosed_untlSnceFree_false` decides that `TableauClosed C` and
`∀ φ ∈ C, untlSnceFree φ = true` cannot both hold: `TableauClosed.serialFuture` demands
`Formula.top.someFuture ∈ C`, and `Formula.someFuture ⊤` is `⊤ untl ⊤`. So the composite above,
`unorderedSuccessor_confined_signedUniverse_of_propositional` and its `ordFree` sibling, and section
D3's `buildTableauAt_isSome_at_seed_lengthBudget_signedUniverse_untlSnceFree` are all vacuously true
— the last one now for two independent reasons, `hlab` and this. This is stated plainly rather than
softened: removing `OrdTimesKnown` was necessary and is done, and it is not sufficient.

**What is not vacuous.** Everything that takes the shape condition without `TableauClosed`:
`applyRule_emitted_time_mem_of_untlSnceFree`,
`unorderedSuccessor_knownTimes_subset_of_untlSnceFree`,
`unorderedSuccessor_label_mem_of_propositional_ordFree`, and section D3's whole
`mintPaysForTime_of_untlSnceFree` chain. The time coordinate is genuinely closed on this fragment;
what is not available is a stock that is simultaneously closed under the engine's outputs and free
of `untl`.

**The boundary that remains, stated exactly.** No theorem in this section removes `hlab` from
`buildTableauAt_isSome_at_seed_lengthBudget_signedUniverse_untlSnceFree` or from any of its eight
siblings, and doing so would in any case exchange one vacuity for another. The live question is no
longer `OrdTimesKnown`; it is whether a stock-closure predicate weaker than `TableauClosed` — one
that does not demand `serialityRule`'s two outputs — supports `unorderedSuccessor_formula_mem`, or
whether a shape condition weaker than `untlSnceFree` still excludes the five arms. Neither is
attempted here and neither is refuted.

**Route 2 remains unattempted and is now unnecessary for this purpose.** An `Ord`-flavoured
`UniverseClosedAt`, and the same for `DifficultyBounded`, cascading through roughly twenty
restatements down to `buildTableauAt`, was the fallback if Route 1 failed. It did not fail. Route 2
is neither started nor recommended. -/

/-! ## D5. The engine-level assembly: `MintPaysForTimeFixed` off `.Dense`, at any universe

**What this section delivers.** `MintPaysForTimeFixed fc U Tmax` — the repaired mint residual the
terminus chain is stated against — proved outright at an **arbitrary** universe, for every frame
class `fc` satisfying `¬ (FrameClass.Dense ≤ fc)`. No syntactic condition on the formulas, no
emptiness, no hypothesis added to the predicate, no figure changed, and no engine definition
touched. At the concrete universe the seed-level termini consume it reads
`mintPaysForTimeFixed_signedUniverse_of_not_dense`, which holds for **every** stock `C` — `untl`
and `snce` nodes included.

**The frame restriction is one condition, and it is written in the statement.** `¬ (FrameClass.Dense
≤ fc)` excludes `.Dense` and `.RTime` together, because `Dense ≤ Dedekind` holds in the
`FrameClass` order, and it admits exactly `.Base` and `.ZTime`. It is not hidden behind a
definition, a `variable`, or a typeclass: a reader of `mintPaysForTimeFixed_of_not_dense` alone sees
it. What it buys is the exclusion of `densityRule` — the one rule that mints a fresh time while
sitting outside both `freshLabelRules` and `selfGuardRules`, and therefore outside every disjunct —
via `findApplicableRule_ne_densityRule`. It does not close the density coordinate: `gapPotential` is
still implemented nowhere and assumed by nothing, and register entry 20's item (b) stands exactly as
written.

**What was missing, and what supplies it.** The per-rule payments all existed already. What did not
exist was the picked rule's *identity* at the successor: `pick_stage_source` hands on `applyRule`'s
pair and discards stage one's `findApplicableRule` equation, and the equation is precisely what the
witness-guarded payments need — `findApplicableRule_guard_linear` and its `.branching` twin read
`witnessPresent … = false` off `findApplicableRule`'s own `if`, which `applyRule` does not carry.
`pick_stage_source_rule` is that threading, in the only shape all three stages support: stage one
reports its equation, stages two and three report that their rule (`serialityRule`, `timeLinearity`)
is outside `freshTimeRules`. With it, `pickBranches_mintPays` splits the picked rule into the four
buckets a `decide`-proved census fixes — no fresh time (disjunct 1), witness-guarded mint (disjunct
2), self-guarded mint (disjunct 3), `densityRule` (excluded) — and every bucket closes from a landed
lemma with both budget conjuncts exact.

**What this retires, and what it generalizes.** Register entry 20's item (a), the engine-level
assembly, is the last non-density obstruction to the mint predicate itself, and it is retired here;
entry 20's paragraph is amended in place to say so. `mintPaysForTimeFixed_signedUniverse_of_not_dense`
generalizes section D3's `mintPaysForTimeFixed_signedUniverse_untlSnceFree` off its syntactic
fragment onto arbitrary `C` — the case entry 20 itself calls the hard one, and the case
`mintPaysForTime_untlNeg_false` refutes the *unrepaired* predicate at. Neither D3's discharge nor
`mintPaysForTimeFixed_signedUniverse_empty` is deleted or altered; both are superseded in prose
only, and D3's remains the statement to reach for at `.Dense` and `.RTime`, where this section is
silent. The discharge here is satisfiable rather than vacuous: `signedUniverse_nonempty` makes the
universe nonempty as soon as `C` and `L` are, and the hypothesis discharged is a *theorem* there.

**And now the part that must not be omitted: this makes NO terminus in this file non-vacuous.**
Landing it unlocks nothing downstream, and saying otherwise would reproduce exactly the failure mode
register entry 21 documents for
`buildTableauAt_isSome_at_seed_lengthBudget_signedUniverse_untlSnceFree`. Both halves of that, named:

* *The nine `hlab` carriers stay vacuous.* Nine statements in this file carry
  `hlab : UnorderedSuccessorLabelClosed fc L` as a live hypothesis, and every one of them is a true
  conditional with a false antecedent at every nonempty `L`, because
  `unorderedSuccessorLabelClosed_nonempty_false` pins that predicate's satisfiability set at exactly
  `{∅}`. Removing `hmint` from such a statement changes nothing about its reach — and this section
  removes `hmint` from none of them in any case, because it restates no terminus at all.
* *The `hlab`-free `hmint`-carrying termini stay conditioned elsewhere.* Each of them still requires
  `UniverseClosedAt fc U`, plus `DifficultyBounded` or `StepLengthBounded`, plus `PostBlockingSettles`
  or `PostBlockingSettlesRun`. Three of those are refuted outright — `DifficultyBounded` by register
  entry 9, clause 1 of `UniverseClosed`/`UniverseClosedAt` at a fixed finite `signedUniverse C L` by
  entry 11, and `PostBlockingSettles` by entry 22. A discharged mint residual does not touch any of
  them.

So the honest reading of this section is: one named residual of the four is now a theorem at a
nonempty universe off `.Dense`, and the count of *satisfiable* residual conditions blocking any
terminus is unchanged. No artifact should read `mintPaysForTimeFixed_of_not_dense` as de-vacuifying
anything. -/

/-- **The strengthened pick-stage bridge.** `pick_stage_source` with the picked rule's *identity*
threaded through, in the only form the three stages can all support: stage one hands on its own
`findApplicableRule` equation, and stages two and three report that their rule is outside the time
census.

This is the whole of what the engine-level assembly was missing. `pick_stage_source` discards the
stage-one equation and keeps only `applyRule`'s pair, which is enough for the disjunct-1 arguments
(`pickBranches_ordTimes`, `pickBranches_time_dichotomy`) and not enough for disjunct 2: the
witness-guard the per-rule payment lemmas consume — `findApplicableRule_guard_linear` and its
`.branching` twin — lives in `findApplicableRule`'s own `if`, not in `applyRule`, and there is no
route to it from `applyRule r sf b ord = (res, o)` alone.

Its two precedents are `pick_stage_source_guarded`, which attaches the blocking-side fact by the
same three-stage `rcases`, and `pick_stage_source_noMint`, whose proof skeleton this is verbatim:
the only difference is that the two later stages report `Or.inr` of the no-mint fact where that
lemma reports it bare, and the first stage reports `Or.inl` of its own equation where that lemma
computes the no-mint fact from a syntactic hypothesis it does not have here. The disjunction is the
honest shape — stages two and three run `serialityRule` and `timeLinearity`, neither of which is
in `freshTimeRules`, and neither of which has a `findApplicableRule` equation to give. -/

/-- **The density exclusion, by frame class.** `densityRule`'s arm of `isApplicable` is
`| .densityRule, .pos, .allFuture _ => decide (FrameClass.Dense ≤ fc)`, so a first-stage pick of it
carries `Dense ≤ fc` as a decided fact; denying that fact excludes the rule outright. Reached
through `findApplicableRule_isApplicable`, which is what makes this ten lines rather than a walk
over `findApplicableRule`'s arm list.

**One hypothesis, not two.** `¬ (FrameClass.Dense ≤ fc)` excludes `.Dense` and `.RTime`
*together*: `Dense ≤ Dedekind` holds in the `FrameClass` order, so a `fc` above `.Dense` is
excluded whether it is `.Dense` itself or anything above it. What it admits is exactly `.Base` and
`.ZTime`. Stating it as a pair of disequalities would be both weaker in form and redundant, and
it is deliberately not hidden behind a definition: a reader of the discharge below sees the
restriction in the statement.

This is the whole of the density treatment in this section. `gapPotential` — register entry 19's
and entry 20's item (b) — is not introduced, not assumed, and not needed here; buying the
exclusion with a frame-class hypothesis is what makes that so. -/

/-! ### The leaf inversions the census case split consumes

Four kinds of fact, all of them read straight off `isApplicable` and `applyRule`: the result shapes
the six witness-guarded minting rules can report, the trigger shape `untlNeg` / `snceNeg` fire on,
their ACTIVE guard, and the four-bucket partition of all thirty-six constructors. None of them is
new mathematics; each is an inversion of an engine definition that is already frozen. -/

/-- **None of the six witness-guarded minting rules ever reports `.persistent`.**

The six are `freshLabelRules ∩ freshTimeRules` — `allFutureNeg`, `allPastNeg`, `someFuturePos`,
`somePastPos`, `untlPos`, `sncePos` — and the two payment lemmas that cover them,
`mintPotential_lt_of_pick_linear_sigmaFixed` and `..._branching_sigmaFixed`, between them cover
`.linear` and `.branching` only. `.branchingOrdered` and `.notApplicable` need no cover: neither
contributes a successor branch to `pickBranches`. `.persistent` would, and this lemma is what
closes it.

**Why the cheaper route is not available, recorded so it is not re-costed.** The obvious saving is
a `.persistent` variant of `mintPotential_lt_of_pick_linear_sigmaFixed`, since
`nonBranchingResultBranch` treats `.linear` and `.persistent` alike and
`applyRule_fresh_witness_nonbranching` is shape-agnostic. It does not exist, and cannot: the
missing input is `witnessPresent r sf b ord = false`, which the `.linear` and `.branching` arms of
`findApplicableRule` supply from their own `if` and the `.persistent` arm **deliberately does not**
— that arm carries no guard at all, by a design decision `findApplicableRule`'s own comment
records. So there is no `findApplicableRule_guard_persistent` to be had, and the exclusion has to
come from the rule side. It does, decidably, and that is this lemma.

`applyRule` has `.persistent` arms in plenty — `boxPos`, `diamondNeg`, `boxTemporal`,
`allFuturePos`, `allPastPos`, `someFutureNeg`, `somePastNeg`, `densityRule`, `priorUZ`, `priorSZ`,
`z1Rule`, `priorUGap`, `priorSGap`, `sepRule` and `serialityRule` all have one — and not one of them
is among the six. -/

`| .untlNeg, .neg, φ => (asUntil? φ).isSome`, so applicability fixes the sign and hands back the
`asUntil?` view's two components. Destructuring `sf` in the conclusion rather than asserting
`sf.sign = .neg` is what lets the consumer feed `selfGuardPotential_lt_of_untlNeg`, whose trigger

/-- **`untlNeg`'s ACTIVE guard, inverted from a non-`notApplicable` result.**

One `by_contra` and no arm analysis, and the absence of the arm analysis is the point: the rule's
PASSIVE arm was retired from `applyRule`, so on a trigger the `asUntil?` view accepts there are
exactly two outcomes — the ACTIVE arm under its own `if`, or `.notApplicable`. A reported result
that is not `.notApplicable` therefore *forces* the guard, and the guard is transcribed here
character for character as the arm's `if` writes it, which is also character for character what
`selfGuardPotential_lt_of_untlNeg` asks for. -/

Every rule either mints no fresh time, or mints one *and* is witness-guarded (the six of
`freshLabelRules ∩ freshTimeRules`), or is one of the two self-guarded minters, or is
`densityRule`. There is no fifth bucket and no residue, and `decide` rather than a hand-written
case list is what guarantees it: a constructor added to `TableauRule` without a home here would
break this proof rather than fall silently into a catch-all. The split is `cases r <;> decide`
rather than `revert r; decide` because `TableauRule` carries no `Fintype` instance, so the
quantified form has no `Decidable` instance to run; `cases` is exhaustive by construction, so the
anti-drift guarantee is the same.

The census is stated over `TableauRule` as a whole rather than over the rules the engine's three
stages can pick, so it covers `serialityRule` and `timeLinearity` too — both in the first bucket,
neither in `freshTimeRules`. -/

/-! ### The four-bucket case split at the `pickBranches` level

The bulk of the section. `MintPaysForTimeFixed`'s three-way disjunct is proved for every successor
branch a pick reports, by splitting the picked rule into the census's four buckets and closing each
from a payment lemma that is already landed. Every bucket's arithmetic is **exact** — the two
budget conjuncts close by `omega` from inequalities with no slack in them — and no bucket adds a
hypothesis to the predicate.

The buckets are stated separately, each with the pick already destructured, so that each is a
standalone obligation with a readable statement rather than a branch of a long tactic block. -/

/-- The pick-source hypothesis `pick_stage_source`'s consumers take, specialised to a pick that has
already been destructured. Saves repeating the `Option`/`Prod` injectivity dance in every bucket. -/

/-- **Bucket A — the rule mints no fresh time: disjunct 1.**

Twenty-seven of the thirty-six constructors, plus `serialityRule` and `timeLinearity`, which is
what the engine's second and third stages run. Nothing about the rule's identity is used beyond the
negative fact: `applyRule_emitted_time_mem` turns it into a `knownTimes` subset, and both of
disjunct 1's conjuncts are read off that subset — the cardinality by `Finset.card_le_card`, the
rank by `splitOrderedRank_le_of_knownTimes_subset` against the ordering growth `pickOrd_mono`
supplies. `σ` does not appear.

This is also the bucket the strengthened bridge's *right* disjunct lands in: stages two and three
report no `findApplicableRule` equation, and they do not need one. -/

/-- **Bucket B — the rule is witness-guarded and mints a time: disjunct 2.**

The six of `freshLabelRules ∩ freshTimeRules`. This is the bucket the strengthened bridge exists
for: the payment lemmas consume `findApplicableRule_guard_linear` / `_branching`, whose
`witnessPresent … = false` guard lives inside `findApplicableRule`'s own `if` and **not** inside
`applyRule`, so `pick_stage_source`'s `applyRule` pair is not enough and the stage-one equation is.

Three of the five result shapes are reachable and only two of them carry a successor branch:
`.branchingOrdered` and `.notApplicable` contribute nothing to `pickBranches`, and `.persistent` is
excluded by `applyRule_ne_persistent_of_fresh`. The remaining two are exactly the two the payment
lemmas cover.

Conjunct 1 is the sum, and it is exact: `|kt nb| ≤ |kt b| + 1` from the pick-level dichotomy, and
`mintPotential nb o + 1 ≤ mintPotential b ord` from the payment, add to
`mintTimeBudget nb o ≤ mintTimeBudget b ord` with nothing left over. -/

/-- **Bucket C, the `untlNeg` half — the rule is self-guarded: disjunct 3.**

`untlNeg` mints a fresh time and is not in `freshLabelRules`, so disjunct 1 fails (a known time was
added) and disjunct 2 cannot move (`mintPotential`'s index set does not mention the rule). What
pays is the rule's own guard: the ACTIVE arm fires only into an empty future and leaves an edge
behind, so `selfGuardPotential` strictly drops. That is register entry 19's route 2 working exactly
as designed — the drop is *paired* with the combined-budget conjunct rather than offered bare,
because a bare drop is refuted there.

The combined conjunct is again exact: `|kt nb| ≤ |kt b| + 1`, `mintPotential nb o ≤ mintPotential b
ord` (branch and ordering both only grow), and `selfGuardPotential o + 1 ≤ selfGuardPotential ord`
sum to the required inequality with nothing to spare.

`sigmaTimeStable_of_sigmaFixed` is what lets `selfGuardPotential_lt_of_untlNeg` — stated at the
time-level hypothesis — be fed from the predicate's formula-level one. -/

The four buckets joined by `rule_census`, with `densityRule` — bucket D — discharged rather than
proved: `findApplicableRule_ne_densityRule` excludes it outright under the frame-class hypothesis,
and it is the only place that hypothesis is used in the whole section. When the bridge reports its
*right* disjunct instead, the rule is outside `freshTimeRules` and lands in bucket A, so no density
case arises on that side either.

Because the split is driven by a `decide`-proved census rather than by a hand-written constructor
list, no rule is handled by an unexamined catch-all: a rule with no bucket would break `rule_census`
rather than pass through here silently. -/

/-- **The discharge.** `MintPaysForTimeFixed fc U Tmax` at an **arbitrary** universe — no syntactic
condition on the formulas, no emptiness, no added hypothesis on the predicate — for every frame
class the density rule cannot fire at.

**The one restriction, in the statement.** `¬ (FrameClass.Dense ≤ fc)` is a single hypothesis and
it is written here rather than hidden behind a definition, a `variable`, or a typeclass. It covers
`.Dense` and `.RTime` together and admits exactly `.Base` and `.ZTime`, and it is what buys
the exclusion of the density coordinate — register entry 20's item (b) — rather than closing it.
`gapPotential` is still implemented nowhere and assumed by nothing.

**What this retires.** Entry 20's item (a): the engine-level assembly. The per-rule payments all
existed; what was missing was the pick's rule identity at the successor, which
`pick_stage_source_rule` now threads. The predicate's hypothesis list is untouched.

**What this does not do.** It makes no terminus in this file non-vacuous. See the section prose. -/

hard one. Neither of those two is deleted or altered; they are superseded in prose only, and
`mintPaysForTimeFixed_signedUniverse_untlSnceFree` remains the statement to reach for at `.Dense`
and `.RTime`, where this one is silent.

nobody meets — which is exactly what separates this from the `hlab` residual. -/

/-! ## C9. The do-not-re-attempt register

Twenty-four statements that look like the natural next lemma and are **not** available. Each is cited
by declaration name and, where one exists, by refuting witness — never by an issue number or a
tracker entry, both of which outlive their meaning. A reader who finds one of these attractive has
already been here.

1. **`buildTableau_isSome`, unconditionally.** False at the engine's own default: the first line of
   `expandBranchWithFuel` returns `none` once `branchesUsed` reaches `maxBranches = 50000`, at
   every fuel figure whatsoever. Any true statement has to quantify the branch budget, which is
   what `buildTableauAt_isSome_of_budget` does. The default is a deliberate runtime guard and is
   not edited by this development.

2. **`buildTableau_isSome_of_budget` in the original target shape** — the branch budget quantified
   as the *only* new hypothesis, with `soundFuel' φ` as the fuel. Refuted by measurement:
   `φ = F(G p)` returns `none` at `fuel = 229376` and `maxBranches = 10¹²`, and the cause is
   `resolveOpenArm = none`, neither the fuel guard nor the budget guard. Raising either number
   changes nothing, because neither appears in the disagreement.

3. **A `.splitOrdered` cardinality twin of `expandOnceUnblocked_split_card_lt`.** Branch
   cardinality is not monotone across an ordered split — arm 3 merges two times and can shrink the
   branch as a set — so there is no `b.toFinset.card < p.1.toFinset.card` to be had. The ordered
   dimension is measured by `splitOrderedRank` instead.

4. **An `allClosed` `iff` between `buildTableauAt` and `buildTableau`.** False, not merely
   unproved. `buildTableauAt_allClosed_imp` is the direction that holds; the converse fails exactly
   when the literal test finds outstanding work at the top-level open branch, the blocking-aware
   test does not, and the post-blocking pass would have closed the branch. That is a genuine
   difference in verdict.

5. **The unconditional, `IrreflOrd`-free form of `witnessPresent_identifyTime`.** Refuted by
   `witnessPresent_identifyTime_unconditional_false`: `TimeOrdering.identifyTime` drops every
   constraint whose endpoints rename together, including a pre-existing self-loop, and a witness
   reachable only around such a loop is destroyed.

6. **Route (a): a lower bound on `(b.identifyTime t₂ t₁).toFinset.card` in terms of
   `b.toFinset.card`.** Dead by definition — `Branch.identifyTime` is `(b.map relabel).eraseDups`
   and the merge is bounded only by `|U|`. Bounding the *loss* from above is available and is
   `shrinkage_le_card`; bounding the survivors from below is not. A reader who meets
   `shrinkage_le_card` and thinks it revives this route has the direction backwards.

7. **Preservation of `OrdTimesLeMaxTime` across the ordered split's identification arm.** Refuted,
   not merely unproved, by `ordTimes_identifyTime_arm3_false`, which decides a configuration where
   `Branch.maxTime` drops from `5` to `0`. The settled repair is `OrdTimesKnown` with
   `ordTimesKnown_identifyTime`, and `ordTimesLeMaxTime_of_ordTimesKnown` records that this is a
   **strengthening** rather than a weakening. A reader who "simplifies" the run invariant back to
   the `≤ maxTime` form is re-attempting a refuted statement.

8. **`BudgetedTotality` with its `β`-linear budget hypothesis and nothing else.** Refuted by
   `budgetedTotality_beta_zero_false`: at `β = 0` the hypothesis degenerates to
   `branchesUsed ≤ maxBranches`, which the engine's strict guard does not respect. The coefficient
   needs `β ≥ 1` to make the budget hypothesis strict and `β ≥ 3` to cover the measured split
   arity; `BudgetedTotalityAt` carries both. Separately, the *figure* in `BudgetedTotality` is
   short — see the divergence recorded in section C7 — which is why the landed statement is at
   `mintAwareFuel`, with `splitAwareFuel_le_mintAwareFuel` recording that the derived figure
   enlarges rather than replaces the landed one.

9. **`DifficultyBounded fc U D` at any `D`, for a `U` the engine fires on.** Refuted, not merely
   unproved, by `difficultyBounded_multiplicity_false`, which is universally quantified in `D` and in
   the frame class. The cause in one line: `estimateBranchDifficulty` sums over the branch **list**
   and adds `b.length / 4`, confinement to `U` bounds only `b.toFinset`, and no `Nodup` invariant on
   a branch exists anywhere in the development — successors are built as raw `formulas ++ b` with no
   `eraseDups` (`Tableau.lean:2233-2239`) and avoiding a `Nodup` side condition was a deliberate
   design goal (`BranchOrder.lean:275-290`). So a `U`-confined branch can be arbitrarily long, and
   `estimateBranchDifficulty_length_le` turns any difficulty bound into a bound on that length.

   **Widening `temporalCount`/`modalCount` does not revive it.** A reader who reaches for
   `Saturation.lean` on the strength of an older version of `DifficultyBounded`'s own docstring has
   already been here: `private` blocks name resolution, not unfolding, so a bound is statable and
   provable from this file with the markers exactly as they are — `estimateBranchDifficulty_length_le`
   and `estimateBranchDifficulty_le_of_subperm` are the demonstrations. And the refuting witness is
   an implication between two atoms, on which both counters are `0`, so the refutation never touches
   them. `Saturation.lean` is deliberately not edited.

   The settled repair is `StepLengthBounded`, which is equivalent to the difficulty bound up to a
   factor of `4` (`difficultyBounded_of_stepLengthBounded`, `stepLengthBounded_of_difficultyBounded`)
   and is satisfiable; `buildTableauAt_isSome_of_lengthBudget` and
   `buildTableauAt_isSome_at_seed_lengthBudget` are the termini stated at it, and
   `difficultyBoundedAt_ceiling` reduces the length-hypothesis form to the rule-local
   `StepLengthGrowth`, whose full obligation map is recorded on its own docstring.

10. **Clause 2 of `UniverseClosed fc U`, at any nonempty `U`.** Refuted, not merely unproved, by
    `universeClosed_identify_retime_false`, which is universally quantified in `U` and takes no frame
    class at all. The cause in one line: the conjunct quantifies the identification's merge **target**
    `t₁` over all of `TimeIndex` with nothing tying it to the branch, so a `Finset` universe would
    have to contain a distinct retiming of one of its own members at every one of infinitely many
    times. `universeClosed_identify_empty` shows it *does* hold at `U = ∅`, so its satisfiability set
    is exactly `{∅}` — satisfiable only where the terminus it guards is vacuous, since
    `signedUniverse C L` is empty only when `C` or `L` is. `universeClosed_nonempty_false` is the
    residual-level corollary.

    **The settled repair is `UniverseClosedAt`**, which restricts `t₁` — and only `t₁` — to
    `b.knownTimes`, and `universeClosedAt_of_universeClosed` records the direction: the new hypothesis
    is *weaker*, so every theorem restated against it is a strengthening. The restriction leaks no new
    hypothesis into the terminus, because both consuming sites reach `t₁` through
    `expandOnceUnblocked_splitOrdered_shape` and `firstIncomparablePair_spec` already returns
    `t₁ ∈ b.knownTimes`; `universeClosedAt_identify_at_trigger` is that bridge.
    `buildTableauAt_isSome_of_lengthBudget_at` and its siblings are the termini stated at the repaired
    shape, and `timeMergeClosed_identifyTime_signedUniverse` discharges the repaired clause at
    `U = signedUniverse C L` under `TimeMergeClosed L`. `UniverseClosed` itself is retained verbatim,
    because the landed terminus is stated against it and nothing in this file is withdrawn.

11. **Clause 1 of `UniverseClosed`/`UniverseClosedAt` at a fixed finite `signedUniverse C L`, and any
    repair of it phrased as a condition on `L`.** Both are refuted.

    *The clause*: `universeClosed_fresh_world_escapes` exhibits `C = {□p, p}`, `L = {⟨0,0⟩}` and the
    one-formula branch `[F(□p)@⟨0,0⟩]`, whose step — `.boxNeg`, at **every** frame class and every
    tracker — emits `F(p)` at world `1`. `applyRule_boxNeg_emitted_world` and
    `applyRule_diamondPos_emitted_world` are why: those two rules emit **only** at
    `Branch.nextWorld`, which `nextWorld_not_mem_worldFinset` says is fresh. Since both predicates
    carry clause 1 verbatim, one witness refutes both;
    `universeClosedAt_fresh_world_escapes` states the second. Blocking does not save it: clause 1
    quantifies over every tracker, and the witness is proved at all of them.

    *Any `L`-side repair*: `freshWorldHeadroom_not_universal` proves that for **no** nonempty finite
    `L` does every `L`-confined branch have `FreshWorldHeadroom L b`. Each enlargement of `L` raises
    the reachable `maxWorld` at least as much as it adds, so the gap re-opens. A reader who, having
    seen `TimeMergeClosed` close clause 2's gap, reaches for the analogous condition on worlds has
    already been here — the asymmetry is real: identification moves a label *within* the existing
    coordinates, whereas `boxNeg` moves it *past* them. The repair therefore has to be branch-side,
    and the residue is carried as the named residual `UnorderedSuccessorLabelClosed`, whose
    per-coordinate obligation map is on its own docstring. What is **not** refuted, and is proved
    outright, is clause 1's *formula* coordinate: `unorderedSuccessor_formula_mem`, for both unordered
    successor shapes.

    *And the label coordinate is not open either — it is refuted outright.* Section C11 reduces the
    residual to the branch-side rectangle `FreshLabelHeadroom`
    (`unorderedSuccessorLabelClosedOrd_of_headroom`) with both coordinates fully accounted for, and
    `freshLabelHeadroom_not_universal` refutes that rectangle at every nonempty finite `L` by the same
    `maxWorld` argument. That much refutes the *reduction's antecedent*. The residual **itself** is
    refuted one step further on, at the same generality:
    `unorderedSuccessorLabelClosed_nonempty_false` and
    `unorderedSuccessorLabelClosedOrd_nonempty_false` are false at every nonempty finite `L`, at every
    frame class, and `unorderedSuccessorLabelClosed_empty` holds at `∅` — so the residual's
    satisfiability set is exactly `{∅}`. Entry 21 carries the consequence for the theorems that
    assume it.

12. **Repairing clause 2 by constraining `t₂`, or by constraining both `t₁` and `t₂`.** Neither is
    wrong in the sense of being false — they are weaker predicates than necessary, which makes every
    theorem assuming them weaker than it needs to be, and that is the defect.
    `timeMergeClosed_identifyTime_signedUniverse`'s proof is the evidence: it constrains only `t₁`,
    and the source time `t₂` is never used to build a label — only ever tested against — so a
    hypothesis about it would sit unused. Constraining `t₂` *instead* of `t₁` does not even repair the
    refutation, since `universeClosed_identify_retime_false` instantiates at
    `t₂ = x.label.time`, which is a known time of its witness branch already; the pigeonhole runs on
    `t₁`. A reader who constrains both has needlessly weakened `UniverseClosedAt`; one who constrains
    only `t₂` has not repaired anything.

13. **"Not in `ruleMintsFreshLabel`" read as "introduces no time".** Refuted in **both** directions
    by `freshTimeRules_incomparable_freshLabelRules`: `boxNeg` and `diamondPos` are witness-guarded
    and mint no time, while `densityRule` (gap-guarded) and the `untlNeg` / `snceNeg` ACTIVE arms
    (`ruleSelfGuarded`) mint a time while sitting outside the list. The two lists are incomparable,
    not nested. `expandOnceNoFresh` is the operational evidence and was there all along: it runs the
    `ruleMintsFreshLabel` test **and then**, separately, a `newOrd.constraints.length` test, and two
    tests in sequence are necessary only when neither list subsumes the other. The census that *is*
    the time-minting list is `freshTimeRules`, nine rules wide, with `mem_freshTimeRules` as its
    anti-drift guarantee.

14. **`MintPaysForTime fc U Tmax` as literally stated.** Refuted, not merely unproved, by
    `mintPaysForTime_untlNeg_false`, which is universally quantified in the frame class **and** in
    `Tmax`. The cause in one line: `untlNeg` is in `freshTimeRules` and not in `freshLabelRules`, so
    firing it mints a time while moving no pair of `mintPotential`'s index set `freshLabelRules ×ˢ U`
    — disjunct 1 fails because a known time was added, disjunct 2 fails because the potential is
    unchanged, and `mintTimeBudget` actually rises. `mintPaysForTime_empty` shows it does hold at
    `U = ∅`, so as with `UniverseClosed` its satisfiability set is where the terminus it guards is
    vacuous.

    **Neither obvious repair is available**, and both are closed off by decided statements rather
    than by argument. *Re-indexing the potential on `freshTimeRules`*:
    `witnessPresent_eq_false_of_not_freshLabel` proves `witnessPresent` is identically `false`
    outside `freshLabelRules` — its match has exactly eight arms — so the three added columns are
    permanently false, contribute `3 · |U|` to the count, and never move. *Dropping disjunct 1's
    cardinality conjunct*, leaving the ordering rank: `splitOrderedRank_lt_of_knownTimes_lt` proves
    one extra known time strictly raises `splitOrderedRank`, because its base `Tmax² + 1` is by
    construction one more than `incompPairs`' range, so the rank conjunct fails at **every**
    time-minting step; `mintPaysForTime_rank_repair_false` decides the weakened predicate false at
    the same configuration, at every frame class, for every `Tmax ≥ 3`.

    What is missing is a **fourth measure component** paying for the three self-guarded minting
    rules — `untlNeg` / `snceNeg`, whose guards are `futureOf`/`pastOf` emptiness plus
    `ord.timeCount < 4`, and `densityRule`, whose guard is the maximal-unfilled-gap set — that also
    survives the identification arm, which can lower `ord.timeCount`. That is open, and it is the
    only thing that is.

15. **Time reuse after an identification: it happens.** Not open, and not forbidden by the run
    invariant. `nextTime_reissues_retired_time` decides a configuration where
    `firstIncomparablePair` merges the branch's largest time away, `Branch.maxTime` drops with it,
    and the post-identification `Branch.nextTime` is exactly the retired value;
    `reuse_driven_through_engine` decides that two `expandOnceUnblocked` steps later that value is
    back on the branch, so this is a run and not a hand-assembled `Branch`. The available facts a
    reader will reach for — `src_not_mem_knownTimes_identifyTime`, `knownTimes_card_lt_identifyTime`
    — say nothing about `Branch.maxTime` and cannot rule it out.

    Consequently the **σ-hit hypothesis of `mintPotential_lt_of_mint` is false**, not merely
    undischarged: `rhoSF_time_ne_src` shows the renaming's image omits the retired time entirely,
    and `mint_not_in_rhoSF_image` turns that into the statement that nothing minted at the re-issued
    time lies in σ's image. The **live-times reformulation does not escape it**: that variant filters
    additionally on the formula's time being a fixed point of `σ`, and `rho_src_ne_src` shows the
    re-issued time is not one. The obstruction is intrinsic to identification-plus-`maxTime`.

16. **An unconditional `applyRule_emitted_time_mem`, without `OrdTimesKnown`.** Refuted by
    `applyRule_emitted_time_mem_ordTimesKnown_needed`. A reader who notices that
    `applyRule_emitted_world_mem` needs no run invariant and removes the hypothesis from its time
    twin has already been here: four rules — `allFuturePos`, `allPastPos`, `someFutureNeg`,
    `somePastNeg` — propagate to every time in `TimeOrdering.futureOf` / `pastOf` of the trigger, and
    nothing in `applyRule` ties an ordering time to the branch. The witness is one branch carrying
    `T(G p)` at the initial label with the ordering asserting `0 < 5`. Their world counterparts have
    no such freedom because all four emit at `l.world`; the asymmetry is real, and it is why
    `mem_knownTimes_of_mem_futureOf` / `_pastOf` exist. The hypothesis costs nothing at the consuming
    sites — `expandOnceUnblocked_ordTimesKnown` supplies it.

    *A syntactically restricted form does exist, and it does not weaken this entry.*
    `applyRule_emitted_time_mem_of_untlSnceFree` (section D3) is the same sweep with
    `OrdTimesKnown b ord` replaced by `∀ x ∈ b, untlSnceFree x.formula = true`, and it reaches
    exactly the `untl`/`snce`-free fragment. The two statements are **incomparable**, not ordered:
    neither hypothesis implies the other, and what this entry refutes is the *unconditional*
    statement — no run invariant, no syntactic condition, nothing — which stays refuted. The witness
    above fails the syntactic condition outright, since its branch carries `T(G p)` and
    `Formula.allFuture p` is an `untl` node.

    *Why it works, so that the boundary is not mistaken for luck.* `haux` is consumed at exactly five
    rule arms and by exactly three closer families, and every one of the five is shape-gated by the
    syntactic condition: `.allFuturePos` and `.allPastPos` through the raw `Formula.allFuture` /
    `Formula.allPast` constructor patterns, `.someFutureNeg` and `.somePastNeg` through the
    `asSomeFuture?` / `asSomePast?` views, and `.orderTrichotomy` through its `fires` guard's demand
    that the branch carry a `Formula.someFuture`-headed disjunct. The first four are gated by the
    *trigger's* shape; the fifth by what the *branch* carries, which is why the restricted form takes
    a branch-level hypothesis rather than a trigger-level one. `boxFree` plays no part: it closes the
    world coordinate, not this one.

    *What this buys downstream.* `unorderedSuccessor_knownTimes_subset_of_untlSnceFree` and, through
    it, `universeClosedAt_signedUniverse_of_propositional` — `UniverseClosedAt` at
    `signedUniverse C L` with no `UnorderedSuccessorLabelClosed`, no `OrdTimesKnown` and no
    frame-class restriction. See section D4's boundary block, and entry 21's closing paragraphs,
    which this supersedes on the point of Route 1 being unattempted.

17. **A fourth measure component in the shape of a second defect ledger over `selfGuardRules ×ˢ U`,
    paying for the self-guarded minting rules by their own discharge.** This is the component entry
    14 says is missing, built in the one shape that survives every objection entry 14 raises — and
    it is refuted anyway, not merely unproved, by `mintPaysForTimeAt_reuse_false`, which is
    universally quantified in the frame class **and** in `Tmax`. The design is landed and named
    (`selfGuardRules`, `selfGuardDischarged`, `selfGuardPotential`, `MintPaysForTimeAt`) only
    because a refutation has to be stated about something; none of it is offered as a repair.

    *What the design gets right, so that a reader does not re-attempt it by fixing the wrong thing.*
    It is a **second** ledger with its own defect notion rather than a widening of `mintPotential`'s,
    so entry 14's `witnessPresent_eq_false_of_not_freshLabel` route does not touch it — the
    catch-all polarity of `selfGuardDischarged` is `true`, making out-of-range columns permanently
    *cured* and contributing `0`, the mirror image of the polarity that kills the re-indexing route.
    It is stated against `ord.futureOf` / `ord.pastOf` emptiness and never against `ord.timeCount`,
    so `TimeOrdering.identifyTime` lowering the cap does not reach it. And it is not inert:
    `selfGuardPotential_lt_at_gate_with_id` decides that at the very step that refutes it the
    potential **does** fall, `4` to `3`, under `σ = id`.

    *What refutes it.* Entry 15's σ-hit obligation, inherited in a weakened **time-hit** form and
    still false. `selfGuardPotential`'s columns are indexed by the σ-image's *time*, not by the
    σ-image formula, so it needs only some `sf ∈ U` with `(σ sf).label.time` equal to the trigger's
    time — strictly less than the literal `σ sf` that `mintPotential_lt_of_mint` demands. **The
    weakening escapes nothing, and the reason is one line.** `rhoSF_time_ne_src` is *already* a
    statement about times: `(rhoSF src tgt sf).label.time ≠ src`, for every `sf` whatsoever. Entry
    15's formula-hit refutation `mint_not_in_rhoSF_image` is three lines on top of it. A weakening
    cannot escape the statement its own refutation was a corollary of.

    *The general reason, then the decided instance.* `selfGuard_no_column_at_retired_time`: the
    curing edge that `untlNeg`'s ACTIVE arm adds is anchored at the trigger's time, so when that
    time is one an earlier identification retired — which entry 15 decides the engine re-issues —
    **no column of `selfGuardRules ×ˢ U` is indexed there at all**, the arm cures nothing, and the
    count cannot fall. That holds for every `U`, every trigger and every retired time; the concrete
    gate is an instance of it, not a lucky configuration. At that gate (`σ = rhoSF 2 0`) all three
    disjuncts fail on decided numbers: the step mints time `3`, so `knownTimes` goes `3 → 4` and
    disjunct 1's `4 ≤ 3` is false; `mintTimeBudget` goes `27 → 28` while `mintPotential` is `24`
    before and after, so both of disjunct 2's conjuncts are false; and `selfGuardPotential` is `3`
    before and after, so disjunct 3's `3 < 3` is false. `gate_is_reissue_hazard` decides all seven
    preconditions separately, so the failure is attributable to the arm rather than to a violated
    hypothesis, and the `σ = id` measurement above locates it at σ rather than at the ledger's shape.

    **So no reshaping of this component is the repair.** The obstruction is intrinsic to
    identification-plus-`maxTime` — the same wall entry 15's live-times reformulation hits — and it
    is indifferent to whether the decrease is witnessed at the trigger's formula or at its time. A
    reader who arrives holding a fourth component whose decrease is witnessed anywhere on the
    trigger's *label* has already been here. What entry 14 says is missing is still missing; this is
    one more closed route to it.

    *What is **not** refuted.* The density coordinate. `densityRule` is outside `selfGuardRules` by
    construction, its termination argument is about the *gap set* rather than about any self-guard,
    and nothing above touches it. The intended second component `gapPotential` — indexed by
    `U ×ˢ U`, `denseRules`-gated, quadratic in `|U|` — is a named residual recorded in the
    subsection "The density residual" above the register, unattempted rather than refuted.

18. **A `nextTime` redefinition, a `TimeOrdering` highwater field, or any other bookkeeping-side
    cure for entry 15's time reuse.** Not refuted — *closed by being unnecessary*, which is why this
    entry reads differently from the seventeen above it. It is here so that a reader who arrives
    holding one of those designs stops before paying for it.

    *What was actually wrong.* Entry 15 is a statement about `Branch.identifyTime` retiring the
    branch's **largest** time. The ordered split's arm 3 called `branch.identifyTime t₂ t₁`, and
    `firstIncomparablePair_spec` guarantees only `t₂ ≠ t₁` — never `t₁ < t₂` — so the arm retired
    `t₂` whatever its magnitude, `Branch.maxTime` fell with it, and `Branch.nextTime`, being
    `maxTime + 1`, handed back the value just retired. The defect was in *which numeral the arm
    chose to keep*, not in `nextTime`'s definition and not in the measure.

    *The repair, in one line.* Arm 3 now merges `min t₁ t₂` into `max t₁ t₂`. Which numeral survives
    is semantically arbitrary — identification asserts the two instants are the same, and nothing in
    the semantics reads a time index's magnitude — so the orientation is free, and it makes
    `Branch.maxTime` non-decreasing at the only branch step that could lower it.
    `maxTime_le_identifyTime_of_le` is the whole content: identifying a time into a time at least as
    large never lowers the maximum, on an arbitrary branch, with no membership hypothesis.
    `retired_lt_nextTime_oriented` is the form that replaces the obstruction — the retired index is
    strictly below the post-arm `nextTime`, so it can never be re-issued — and
    `maxTime_monotone_along_run` / `nextTime_monotone_along_run` lift it off the arm to every
    successor of every shape the engine reports, over the checked shape census
    `expandOnce_branch_shape_census` rather than over the prose claim that arm 3 is the engine's
    only non-additive step.

    *Read entry 15 with this correction.* Entry 15 says `reuse_driven_through_engine` shows the
    reuse "is a run and not a hand-assembled `Branch`". That is half right, and the half that is
    wrong matters here. `reuse_driven_through_engine` is driven from `reuseWitnessState`, which is
    assembled by a **direct** `Branch.identifyTime reuseWitnessBranch 2 0` call rather than by the
    engine's arm; what it decides is the *conditional* "if a run reaches a branch whose `maxTime`
    has fallen below an index it once carried, the engine re-mints that index." That conditional is
    as true now as it ever was, and it is deliberately left at its original decided value.
    `oriented_engine_does_not_produce_reuse` supplies the measurement it cannot make: at the same
    witness, the arm now hands back `maxTime = 2` and `nextTime = 3` where it used to hand back `1`
    and `2`, and one further engine step does not recover the retired value. The implication stands;
    its antecedent is unreachable.

    *Why not the bookkeeping-side designs, measured rather than asserted.* Two were costed before
    the arm was touched. A `horizon : TimeIndex` field on `TimeOrdering`, raised at every mint and
    never lowered: `TimeOrdering` is referenced in 29 files, with 35 `{ constraints := }` sites and
    47 `: TimeOrdering :=` bindings, and Lean's anonymous constructor does not fill default field
    values, so every literal breaks — including the closed terms the `decide`-based witnesses in
    this file evaluate. A run-level mint counter threaded through `applyRule` /
    `expandOnceUnblocked`: changes the signature of the engine's two central functions, which this
    file alone references hundreds of times, and pulls `Saturation.lean` into scope. Neither was
    prototyped, because the arm orientation decided the question at zero new state, zero signature
    changes and one edited call site.

    *The scope fact a future reader needs before reaching for a `nextTime` redefinition.*
    `Verified/Decidable.lean` carries **102** `Branch.nextTime` references —
    `lt_nextTime_of_mem_knownTimes`, `OrdWithin.bound` and `OrdWithin.nextTime_not_mem` among them —
    which consume `nextTime = maxTime + 1` *definitionally*. That file independently rediscovered
    this same obstruction from the `OrdWithin` side and recorded it in prose, with its own
    counterexample (`b = [f₀, f₇]`, `ord = ⟨[(5, 7)]⟩`). The repair therefore holds
    `Branch.nextTime`, `Branch.maxTime`, `Branch.identifyTime` and `TimeOrdering.identifyTime`
    **byte-unchanged** and goes to the call site instead; under that constraint `Decidable.lean`'s
    exposure collapses from 102 references to one docstring paragraph, and the nine `branch.nextTime`
    mint sites in `Tableau.lean` need no edit at all, since a monotone `maxTime` makes `nextTime`
    monotone for free at every one of them.

    *What survived, checked and not assumed.* `OrdTimesKnown` (entries 7 and 16) by
    `ordTimesKnown_identifyTime_oriented`; the run invariant by `runInvariant_identifyTime_oriented`;
    `UniverseClosedAt`'s clause 2 (entries 10-12) by `universeClosedAt_identify_at_trigger_oriented`
    and `timeMergeClosed_identifyTime_oriented`, discharging the clause **as it stands** — no
    both-times constraint was added, so entry 12's finding is untouched; the `.splitOrdered`
    measure's first component by `knownTimes_card_lt_at_arm3_oriented`. The one lemma that needed
    genuinely new content is `incomparableB_symm`, whose proof needed the backward half of the
    reachability duality (`orderDual_backward`) because `orderDual_holds` states it forwards only.
    `ordTimes_identifyTime_arm3_false` was re-checked and is still **true**: the orientation does not
    accidentally rescue the refuted `OrdTimesLeMaxTime`, and entry 7 stands as written.

    *And what this does **not** do — read this before treating entry 14 as reopened.* It does not
    supply the missing fourth measure component, and it does not make `MintPaysForTime` true. Entry
    14's refutation is about the predicate as literally stated and is untouched. Entry 17's
    refutation of the `selfGuardRules ×ˢ U` ledger stands as a statement **about the unoriented
    arm**: its σ-hit obligation was inherited from entry 15's reuse configuration, and that
    configuration no longer occurs on the engine path — so whether a measure-side component is now
    *provable* is a genuinely open follow-on question, not something this entry answers and not
    something entry 17 forecloses any more. Nobody should read "the reuse is closed" as "the measure
    is closed". They are different claims, and only the first is established here.

19. **Re-reading entry 17's refutation as closing the fourth-component question, and the four
    routes that closing suggests.** The last of these entries and, like entry 18, not a refutation:
    it records a verdict that has been **overturned**, and the four things a reader who has just
    read entry 17 will try next, three of which are closed and one of which is done.

    *What was withdrawn, and what was not.* `mintPaysForTimeAt_reuse_false` is untouched, still
    true, and still the correct statement about `MintPaysForTimeAt`: that predicate quantifies `σ`
    with no tie to the state it is read at, so a renaming no run produces refutes it. What entry 17
    could not say — because the arm had not been reoriented when it was written — is that its own
    refuting renaming, `gateSigma = rhoSF 2 0`, is the *unoriented* arm's output at the reuse
    witness's trigger `(0, 2)`. `identifyOrient` retires the smaller numeral, so the arm now
    produces `rhoSF 0 2` there, and `gateSigma_not_sigmaTimeStable` decides that the old renaming
    moves the gate's own trigger off its own time while no renaming the oriented arm produces does
    that to a formula the branch still carries. At the oriented gate the component's potential falls
    `3 → 1` where entry 17 measured `3 → 3` (`orientedGate_verdict_side_by_side`), and the design
    entry 17 refuted is the design that now carries the measure. Entry 18 anticipated exactly this
    and said so; this entry is its resolution.

    *Route 1, closed: `MintPaysForTimeAt → MintPaysForTimeStable`.* Not available, and the reason is
    not fixable by proof effort. The two predicates' third disjuncts differ: `MintPaysForTimeAt`'s is
    the bare `selfGuardPotential` drop, `MintPaysForTimeStable`'s pairs that drop with a
    **combined-budget** non-increase, `mintTimeBudget + selfGuardPotential`. The pairing is forced —
    see route 2 — so the implication does not hold and is not claimed.
    `mintPaysForTimeStable_of_mintPaysForTime` is proved directly from disjuncts 1 and 2 instead.

    *Route 2, closed: a bare `selfGuardPotential` drop as the third disjunct, at any weight.*
    `extensionAllowance` is `|U| + mintTimeBudget·|U| − |b|`, so it rises by a full `|U|` for every
    unit of mint budget a step spends, and a self-guarded mint spends one — it adds a time to
    `knownTimes` and leaves `mintPotential` alone, `untlNeg` and `snceNeg` not being in
    `freshLabelRules`. A disjunct that constrains only `selfGuardPotential` therefore leaves the
    measure's second component unbounded above at the very step it is meant to pay for, and no
    weight on the fourth component is a function of `|U|` in a way that fixes it while `Tmax` is
    free. The repair is the combined conjunct, and the weight that goes with it is
    `2·(Tmax² + 1) + |U|` — the `|U|` is exactly the allowance's per-budget-unit factor.

    *Route 3, closed: keeping `BudgetState` as the carried state.* Its budget clause is
    `mintTimeBudget ≤ Tmax`, and a self-guarded mint raises `mintTimeBudget` by one, so the state
    cannot survive the step however the measure is weighted — the failure is in the state predicate,
    not in the measure. `BudgetStateAt` carries `mintTimeBudget + selfGuardPotential ≤ Tmax`
    instead, which is non-increasing at that step because the mint spends exactly one unit of the
    fourth component to buy the one unit of mint budget it consumes. The cost is a figure:
    the mint-budget floor rises `8·|U| → 10·|U|` and `derivedTmax → derivedTmaxAt`, both recorded as
    enlargements (`derivedTmax_le_derivedTmaxAt`, `mintAwareFuel_le_mintAwareFuelAt`), and no
    caller's hypothesis list changes.

    *Route 4, open and named: the discharge at a nonempty universe.* This is the one thing left, and
    it is **not** the σ-hit obligation any more — that is discharged, by
    `sigma_time_hit_of_sigmaTimeStable`, from confinement plus a σ-time-stability hypothesis that
    `BudgetStateAt` carries and both step lemmas preserve (`sigmaTimeFixed_identifyOriented` at the
    arm, `sigmaTimeFixed_grow_of_fixesFrom` with `unorderedSuccessor_time_dichotomy` and
    `nextTime_monotone_along_run` at every additive step). What blocks it is the **density**
    coordinate, unchanged since entry 17 named it: `densityRule` mints a fresh time and lies outside
    both `freshLabelRules` and `selfGuardRules`, so at a `densityRule` step disjunct 1 fails and
    neither of the other two can move. `densityRule` is `denseRules`-gated, so a discharge
    restricted to frame classes outside `.Dense` / `.RTime` is not refuted; what it needs is a
    rule-by-rule census showing every remaining rule either mints no time, is witness-guarded, or is
    self-guarded. That census is not attempted here, and `gapPotential` — indexed by `U ×ˢ U`,
    `denseRules`-gated — remains implemented nowhere and assumed by nothing.
    `mintPaysForTimeStable_signedUniverse_empty` is how far the discharge goes today: the same
    boundary `mintPaysForTime_empty` records, at a concrete `signedUniverse C L`.

    *What is delivered, so the record is not only negative.* `MintPaysForTimeStable` with its
    direction lemma and no-leak confirmation; `selfGuardPotential`'s ceiling, growth and
    identification-arm preservation (Constraint (F), discharged with equality-or-better); the
    `untlNeg` and `snceNeg` discharge lemmas with their engine-level ordering shapes; the
    four-component measure `budgetPotentialAt` with both step lemmas and the C6 instantiation; and
    the two seed-level termini restated with an identical hypothesis list, one weaker residual and
    two larger figures. Entry 14's "what is missing" is now missing only at the density coordinate.

    *One line of this entry is withdrawn by entry 20.* The closing sentence above — that only the
    density coordinate is left — is wrong, and wrong in a way that was decidable when it was
    written. Read it as "missing at the density coordinate **and** at the formula coordinate";
    everything else in this entry stands.

20. **`MintPaysForTimeStable fc U Tmax` at any nonempty `U`, and the reading of entry 19's route 4
    that goes with it.** Refuted, not merely unproved, by
    `mintPaysForTimeStable_signedUniverse_false`, which is universally quantified in the frame class
    **and** in `Tmax` and is stated at a concrete nonempty `signedUniverse C L` — the universe shape
    the seed-level termini actually consume. There is no `densityRule` in the vehicle.

    *The cause, in one line.* `SigmaTimeStable` constrains σ's **times**; disjunct 2 needs it to
    constrain σ's **formulas**. `mintPotential_lt_of_mint` asks for `σ sf = g` on the nose, and
    `sigma_time_hit_of_sigmaTimeStable`'s own docstring already recorded that it does not supply
    that. Disjunct 2 is the only disjunct that pays for the six rules of
    `freshLabelRules ∩ freshTimeRules`, and disjunct 3 cannot stand in for it at a trigger whose
    reach is already non-empty — which is the ordinary case, not a contrived one.

    *The vehicle, and why it is not a technicality.* `flatSigma` sends every signed formula to a
    fixed positive atom at its own label. `witnessPresent_flatSigma` decides that its image is
    witness-free at all thirty-six rules, so `mintPotential_flatSigma` pins the potential at its own
    ceiling `8·|U|` at **every** state of **every** run — disjunct 2's strict inequality is
    unavailable everywhere, before any configuration is chosen. `selfGuardPotential_flatSigma` shows
    the same renaming leaves the fourth component measuring exactly what `id` measures, so the
    refutation cannot be dismissed as one that breaks the self-guard ledger too. The step is
    `untlPos` — witness-guarded, so squarely one of the six — at a time whose future is already
    non-empty; `knownTimes` goes `3 → 4`, `mintPotential` is `144` either side, and
    `selfGuardPotential` is `12` either side because the step's one new edge is `(1, 3)` and no
    formula of the universe sits at time `3`.

    *What this does **not** withdraw.* Nothing. `mintPaysForTimeStable_of_mintPaysForTime`, the
    no-leak confirmation, the four-component measure, `budgetPotentialAt` and the six restated
    termini all stand exactly as written; what changes is the reading of the residual they carry.
    Entry 19's routes 1, 2 and 3 are untouched — they are about the third disjunct's shape and the
    carried state's budget clause, neither of which appears here.

    *The repair, landed with its direction lemma.* State the hypothesis at the coordinate the
    obligation lives at: `SigmaFixed σ b` (σ fixes every branch formula) in place of
    `SigmaTimeStable σ b`, giving `MintPaysForTimeFixed`, with
    `mintPaysForTimeFixed_of_mintPaysForTimeStable` fixing the direction — the hypothesis is
    stronger, so the predicate is **weaker**, so every restatement is a strengthening. The repair is
    free at the only step that changes σ, and that is a fact about `rhoSF` rather than a
    coincidence: `rhoSF_eq_of_ne_src` strengthens `rhoSF_time_eq_of_ne_src`'s conclusion from "same
    time" to "same formula" by the same one line, so `sigmaFixed_identifyOriented` and
    `sigmaFormulaFixed_identifyOriented` are their time-level originals' proofs verbatim. It costs
    **no figure**: `budgetPotentialAt`, `mintPathBoundAt`, `mintAwareFuelAt` and `derivedTmaxAt` are
    reused byte for byte by `buildTableauAt_isSome_at_seed_lengthBudget_signedUniverse_fixed` and
    its five predecessors. `flatSigma_not_sigmaFixed` decides that the vehicle above does not reach
    the repaired predicate.

    *What is left, stated so it is not mistaken for what entry 19 said was left.* One thing now,
    where there were two. **(a)** The engine-level assembly is **landed**, in section D5. The
    per-rule payments all existed — `mintPotential_lt_of_pick_linear_sigmaFixed` and
    `..._branching_sigmaFixed` for the six witness-guarded minting rules,
    `selfGuardPotential_lt_of_untlNeg` / `..._snceNeg` for the two self-guarded ones,
    `applyRule_emitted_time_dichotomy` plus `expandOnceUnblocked_ord_mono` for the twenty-seven that
    mint no time — and what was missing was threading the pick's rule through
    `expandOnceUnblocked`'s three stages so that the case split is available at the successor.
    `pick_stage_source_rule` is that threading, `pickBranches_mintPays` is the four-bucket case
    split it enables, and `mintPaysForTimeFixed_of_not_dense` is the discharge, at an arbitrary
    universe under the single hypothesis `¬ (FrameClass.Dense ≤ fc)`;
    `mintPaysForTimeFixed_signedUniverse_of_not_dense` is its `signedUniverse C L` form, for **every**
    stock `C` including one carrying `untl` and `snce` — the case this entry calls the hard one, and
    the case section D3's syntactic fragment excludes. **(b)** The density coordinate, exactly as
    entry 19 describes it and untouched by any of this, is what remains. The frame-class hypothesis
    excludes `densityRule` rather than paying for it; a discharge at `.Dense` and `.RTime` still
    needs `gapPotential`, which remains implemented nowhere and assumed by nothing.

    *And the scope of (a), stated so it is not overread.* Landing the assembly makes **no** terminus
    in this file non-vacuous, and no artifact should claim otherwise. The nine `hlab` carriers stay
    vacuous at every nonempty `L` by `unorderedSuccessorLabelClosed_nonempty_false`, whatever happens
    to `hmint`; and every `hlab`-free `hmint`-carrying terminus stays conditioned on
    `UniverseClosedAt` plus `DifficultyBounded` or `StepLengthBounded` plus `PostBlockingSettles` or
    `PostBlockingSettlesRun`, three of which entries 9, 11 and 22 refute. What (a) delivers is that
    one named residual of the four is now a theorem at a nonempty universe off `.Dense`, and that
    section D3's discharge is generalized off its syntactic fragment. The count of *satisfiable*
    residual conditions blocking any terminus is unchanged. Omitting this sentence would reproduce
    exactly the failure mode entry 21 documents.

    *And what neither (a) nor (b) is needed for.* Both are obligations on a **time mint**, so both
    are vacuous on a universe where no rule can mint. Section D3 discharges `MintPaysForTime`
    itself — not `MintPaysForTimeFixed`, and not a further repair — at every universe of
    `untl`/`snce`-free formulas, at **every** frame class including `.Dense` and `.RTime`:
    all nine members of `freshTimeRules` are gated by `isApplicable` on a shape containing an
    `untl` or `snce` node, `densityRule` among them through `Formula.allFuture`'s expansion, and
    the engine's other two stages run only `serialityRule` and `timeLinearity`. So the reading to
    avoid is that (a) and (b) gate *every* discharge; they gate the discharge at a universe carrying
    a temporal operator, which is the case `mintPaysForTime_untlNeg_false` shows is the hard one.

21. **Discharging `UnorderedSuccessorLabelClosed` now that the time coordinate has landed.** The
    accounting is complete and the residual still does not fall, and this entry exists because the
    file itself once said otherwise: `UnorderedSuccessorLabelClosed`'s docstring recorded the time
    coordinate as *the missing piece*, which invites the reading that supplying it would finish the
    job. It does not, and the corrected paragraph on that docstring says so.

    *What the time analogue does buy.* The **reduction**, in full. Section C11's
    `unorderedSuccessor_label_mem_of_headroom` proves clause 1's label dimension outright — no
    hypothesis about the successor, no residual, both coordinates accounted for — from
    `unorderedSuccessor_world_dichotomy`, `unorderedSuccessor_time_dichotomy` and the branch-side
    rectangle `FreshLabelHeadroom`. `unorderedSuccessorLabelClosedOrd_of_headroom` is that reduction
    at the residual's own shape, and
    `unorderedSuccessor_confined_signedUniverse_of_freshLabelHeadroom` is clause 1 at
    `signedUniverse C L` with nothing residual left standing.

    *Why the residual survives it.* Because the reduced antecedent is refutable:
    `freshLabelHeadroom_not_universal` proves that for **no** nonempty finite `L` does every
    `L`-confined branch carry the rectangle, by the same `maxWorld` argument as entry 11 —
    `freshWorldHeadroom_of_freshLabelHeadroom` is the one line that transports it. The obstruction is
    the world coordinate's refutation, and it was never the missing time lemma. A reader who reaches
    for the time analogue expecting the residual to close has already been here.

    *And the residual is not merely un-discharged — it is FALSE, at every nonempty finite `L`.* This
    is stronger than the paragraph above, which refutes only the *reduced antecedent* and so leaves
    open the reading that a route not through `FreshLabelHeadroom` might still succeed at some
    carefully chosen `L`. No such `L` exists. `unorderedSuccessorLabelClosedOrd_nonempty_false`
    refutes the weaker `Ord` form at every nonempty finite `L` at every frame class, and
    `unorderedSuccessorLabelClosed_nonempty_false` is the one-line consequence for the original;
    `unorderedSuccessorLabelClosed_empty` supplies the other end. **The satisfiability set of
    `UnorderedSuccessorLabelClosed fc L` is exactly `{∅}`** — and `signedUniverse C ∅ = ∅`, so the
    only label set at which the hypothesis is available is the one at which the universe is empty.

    The generalization from `unorderedSuccessorLabelClosed_not_universal`'s single witness is
    mechanical, and the reason is structural rather than lucky: the engine's shape gates match a
    signed formula's **sign and formula constructor**, never its label, so `F(□p)` fires `.boxNeg`
    wherever it is put and the emission always lands at `Branch.nextWorld`. Running the witness at a
    label of maximal world in `L` therefore escapes `L` by maximality. The label-generalized witness
    family (`freshWorldWitnessAt`, `freshWorldBranchAt`, `freshWorldEmittedAt`) sits in section C11
    beside the original, which is retained.

    *The consequence for the nine theorems that assume it.* Every one of these carries
    `hlab : UnorderedSuccessorLabelClosed fc L` as a live hypothesis, and each is therefore a
    **vacuously true conditional at every `L` for which its universe is nonempty**:

    That last one is worth naming twice, because its section heading promises a discharge "at a
    **nonempty** universe" and its docstring once read as though the promise were kept: the `hmint`
    half is kept, the `hlab` half is not, and the theorem is vacuous at exactly the universes the
    section is about. This is the failure mode `DifficultyBounded` fell into and that
    `timeMergeClosed_product` exists to rule out elsewhere. Discharging `hmint` at a nonempty
    universe — a separate line of work — does **not** unlock any of the nine; `hlab` has to go, and
    going means being *replaced* by a condition that is satisfiable, not proved.

    *What a replacement may not be.* Any candidate replacement must be exhibited as satisfiable at a
    nonempty `L` before it is stated as a discharge, and no `L`-side condition can do it:
    `freshWorldHeadroom_not_universal` proves that no condition on a finite `L` absorbs a fresh
    world. A replacement therefore has to bite on the *stock*, before the world-minting rules can
    fire at all.

    *The rectangle is not an over-approximation that a sharper proof would shrink.* A label is a
    **pair** and the two dichotomies are per-coordinate, so four quadrants have to be covered.
    Confinement of `b` covers none of them: `∀ x ∈ b, x.label ∈ L` constrains the pairs `b` carries,
    not their cross product, so `⟨w, t⟩` for a `w` and a `t` that `b` carries on *different* formulas
    is not thereby in `L`. `FreshWorldHeadroom` covers one quadrant, which is why it alone was never
    going to be enough even with both dichotomies in hand. The same rectangle shape appears on the
    clause-2 side as `timeMergeClosed_iff_product`, arrived at from the opposite direction.

    *What is not withdrawn.* Nothing. `UnorderedSuccessorLabelClosed`,
    `unorderedSuccessor_confined_signedUniverse_of_headroom` and the terminus chain that consumes
    them stand exactly as written; `UnorderedSuccessorLabelClosedOrd` is an additional, weaker
    predicate stated beside the original, with
    `unorderedSuccessorLabelClosedOrd_of_unorderedSuccessorLabelClosed` fixing the direction and
    `unorderedSuccessorLabelClosedOrd_not_universal` confirming that adding `OrdTimesKnown` does not
    weaken it into vacuity.

    *The `L`-side replacement route, how far it reaches, and where it stops.* Section D4 supplies the
    replacement this entry calls for, and it reaches further than C11 did without reaching a
    terminus. The world coordinate — the one `freshWorldHeadroom_not_universal` proves no condition
    on a finite `L` can ever close — is closed outright on a `boxFree` branch
    (`unorderedSuccessor_worldFinset_subset`), and joined with D3's time coordinate and the
    `TimeMergeClosed` rectangle it gives
    `unorderedSuccessor_confined_signedUniverse_of_propositional`: clause 1 at `signedUniverse C L`
    from hypotheses that are **all satisfiable**. That is strictly better than C11's position, where
    the reduced antecedent was itself refutable.

    *The shape mismatch this entry once recorded as the stopping point is gone.* An earlier version
    of this paragraph said the section stopped one step short of a restated terminus because every
    route through the time coordinate carried `OrdTimesKnown b ord` — which
    `applyRule_emitted_time_mem_ordTimesKnown_needed` proves is not removable from
    `applyRule_emitted_time_mem` — while `UniverseClosedAt`'s clause 1 quantifies `ord` freely and
    offers no such hypothesis. It named two routes past the mismatch and recorded the first of them,
    removing `OrdTimesKnown` on this fragment, as **unattempted**. It has since been attempted and it
    works: `applyRule_emitted_time_mem_of_untlSnceFree` trades the run invariant for branch-level
    `untl`/`snce`-freeness (entry 16 records why, arm by arm), and
    `universeClosedAt_signedUniverse_of_propositional` is `UniverseClosedAt fc (signedUniverse C L)`
    with **no** `UnorderedSuccessorLabelClosed`, **no** `OrdTimesKnown` and **no** frame-class
    hypothesis, every one of whose hypotheses is exhibitable. The second route — an `Ord`-flavoured
    `UniverseClosedAt` and `DifficultyBounded` cascading through some twenty restatements — remains
    unattempted and is no longer needed for this purpose.

    *What has not changed.* None of the nine carriers below has been restated, so every one still
    takes `hlab` and **all nine remain vacuous at every nonempty `L`**. This entry's consequence
    paragraph stands as written.

    *And the replacement composite is vacuous too, for an unrelated reason — so re-pointing the
    carriers at it would buy nothing.* `tableauClosed_untlSnceFree_false` (section D4) decides that
    `TableauClosed C` and `∀ φ ∈ C, untlSnceFree φ = true` cannot both hold: `TableauClosed`'s
    `serialFuture` field demands `Formula.top.someFuture ∈ C`, because `serialityRule` emits `T(F⊤)`
    at every label from no trigger at all, and `Formula.someFuture ⊤` is `⊤ untl ⊤`. So
    `universeClosedAt_signedUniverse_of_propositional`,
    `unorderedSuccessor_confined_signedUniverse_of_propositional` and its `ordFree` sibling are all
    vacuously true, and `buildTableauAt_isSome_at_seed_lengthBudget_signedUniverse_untlSnceFree` —
    already in the list of nine — is vacuous twice over, through `hlab` and through this.

    This does **not** retract anything above and it does not touch the machinery that carries only
    the shape condition: `applyRule_emitted_time_mem_of_untlSnceFree`,
    `unorderedSuccessor_knownTimes_subset_of_untlSnceFree`,
    `unorderedSuccessor_label_mem_of_propositional_ordFree` and section D3's
    `mintPaysForTime_of_untlSnceFree` chain take no `TableauClosed` and stand non-vacuously. The
    obstruction has moved: it is no longer `OrdTimesKnown`, and it is no longer on the `L` side at
    all. It is that no stock is simultaneously closed under the engine's unconditional outputs and
    free of `untl`. A reader who wants a non-vacuous propositional terminus needs a stock-closure
    predicate weaker than `TableauClosed` — one not demanding `serialityRule`'s two outputs — with
    `unorderedSuccessor_formula_mem` re-derived at it, or a shape condition weaker than
    `untlSnceFree` that admits `⊤ untl ⊤` while still excluding the five arms entry 16 names.
    Neither is attempted and neither is refuted.

    *And the narrowing is forced.* D4's replacement reaches only the purely propositional fragment,
    because `boxFree` and `untlSnceFree` together exclude `□`, `untl` and `snce`. That is not a proof
    weakness: `freshWorldHeadroom_not_universal` refutes every `L`-side alternative, so the only
    available handle is the stock, and both world-minting rules are gated on a `.box` node. A reader
    who wants the replacement at the modal fragment is asking for something the world coordinate's
    refutation rules out.

22. **`PostBlockingSettles fc` as literally stated.** Refuted, not merely unproved, by two witnesses,
    both universally quantified in the frame class: `postBlockingSettles_fuel_zero_false` at the
    `fuel = 0` arm, and `postBlockingSettles_fuel_gap_false` at a nonzero one.

    *The cause in one line.* `expandOnceNoFresh` **skips** any candidate whose applicable rule mints
    a fresh label or lengthens the ordering constraints — its `pick` returns `none` and the search
    continues past it — while `findUnexpandedUnblockedWith` tests only `!isExpanded`, which is
    `findApplicableRule ≠ none` with no reference to minting at all. So a formula at an unblocked
    time whose only rule mints is invisible to the first test and visible to the second, and the two
    tests disagree at **every** fuel.

    ***Fuel does not close it***, which answers the open question the residual's own docstring used
    to pose. `postBlockingSettles_gap_at_every_fuel` exhibits both halves at once, universally
    quantified in `fuel`: `saturateBlocked freshWorldBranch fuel TimeOrdering.empty fc` returns the
    branch unchanged while the saturation test reports outstanding work on it. The fuel-universal
    step is `saturateBlocked_eq_self_of_noFresh_saturated`, two cases and no induction — from
    `fuel + 1` the pass reaches its `(.saturated, _)` arm before any guard. The witness is the landed
    `freshWorldBranch = [F(□p)@⟨0,0⟩]` reused from entry 11's refutation; `.boxNeg` mints a fresh
    **world**, so it trips `expandOnceNoFresh`'s *first* rejection test. Entry 13 records why there
    are two rejection tests and why a time-minting witness would refute the predicate the same way
    through the second.

    *The `fuel = 0` arm is not a technicality, and the reader who wants to "just require `fuel > 0`"
    should read this sentence.* At `fuel = 0` the pass hands its input back untested, so the
    predicate's hypothesis is satisfied at **every** branch whatsoever and the predicate then asserts
    that every branch is blocking-aware saturated. That arm is reachable at every top-level fuel
    figure, because the pass recurses with the fuel decremented.

    *What the settlement question actually reduces to*, proved rather than asserted:
    `postBlockingSettlesAt_settlement` shows that `expandOnceNoFresh` reporting `.saturated`, plus no
    label-minting work at an unblocked time (`NoUnblockedFreshWork`), forces the conclusion. The
    inversion it runs on is `expandOnceNoFresh_saturated_imp`, which needs
    `findApplicableRule_result_ne_notApplicable` to kill `expandOnceNoFresh`'s *second* route to
    `.saturated` — its `.notApplicable` arm, which returns the picked ordering rather than the
    incoming one. Entry 23 says why that is not a repair.

23. **`PostBlockingSettlesAt`, and every repair of entry 22 that relocates conditions onto the
    post-blocking pass's output branch.** Not open: closed, and closed twice over.

    *The design, so a reader does not re-attempt it by fixing the wrong part.* Add the two conditions
    the settlement argument actually uses as antecedents on the output branch —
    `LabelFreeSaturatedExit` (the pass ran to label-free saturation rather than being truncated) and
    `NoUnblockedFreshWork` (no label-minting work at an unblocked time) — leaving the conclusion
    verbatim. `postBlockingSettlesAt_of_postBlockingSettles` fixes the direction in the register's
    own idiom: the hypothesis list is longer, so the predicate is weaker, so every restatement would
    be a strengthening. All of it is landed, and none of it is offered as a repair.

    *First closure: the consuming sites cannot supply the antecedents.* Both
    `armSettlement_of_postBlockingSettles` and `buildTableauAt_isSome_of_settles` reach the residual
    holding exactly one fact about the output pair, the exit equation.
    `labelFreeSaturatedExit_not_of_saturateBlocked_inr` decides that this equation does not carry
    `LabelFreeSaturatedExit`: at `fuel = 0`, `saturateBlocked (multBranch 1) 0 ord fc` returns its
    input while `expandOnceNoFresh` fires `.impNeg` on it. The one bridge shape that would typecheck
    carries the extra hypothesis `PostBlockingExitSettled fc`, and `postBlockingExitSettled_false`
    refutes that at every frame class — it implies entry 22's refuted predicate through
    `postBlockingSettles_of_postBlockingExitSettled`. So the only available bridge is a weakening
    dressed as a repair. No terminus is restated against it; that is deliberate, and it is the same
    judgement entry 7 records having once got wrong.

    *Second closure, and the sharper one: the second antecedent is the conclusion in disguise.*
    `noUnblockedFreshWork_of_settled` proves, unconditionally, that a branch whose settlement test
    already closes satisfies `NoUnblockedFreshWork` — its antecedent is then unsatisfiable. Together
    with the settlement lemma this gives
    `noUnblockedFreshWork_iff_of_labelFreeSaturatedExit`: *given* `LabelFreeSaturatedExit`, the two
    are **equivalent**. So `PostBlockingSettlesAt fc` is a theorem — `postBlockingSettlesAt_holds`,
    outright, at every frame class — for a reason that is not progress, and a reader who reads
    "the repaired predicate is proved" as "the residual is discharged" has the situation backwards.

    *What the design does buy, so the record is not only negative.* The residual's content is now
    located exactly: it is a **fuel-adequacy** fact about the pass plus a **label-minting** fact about
    the branch it reaches, and neither is a settlement question. `LabelFreeUniverseAt` with
    `noUnblockedFreshWork_of_labelFreeUniverseAt` is the one direction the equivalence does not
    collapse — a branch-independent sufficient condition, checkable from the universe and the
    ordering without looking at the branch. It has to be stated at a fixed ordering rather than at a
    universe alone, and that is forced rather than conservative: `orderTrichotomy` is in
    `allRulesForFC`, is applicable to *every* signed formula, and lengthens the ordering exactly when
    the ordering carries an incomparable pair. And the discharge is not at a vacuous boundary —
    `saturateBlocked_multBranch_one_run` decides that the pass itself produces the three-formula
    branch `multSettledBranch` at every frame class and every positive fuel, and
    `postBlockingSettlesAt_labelFree` is the settlement delivered there.

    *The route that was named here as unattempted, and is now landed.* Restrict entry 22's
    quantification from "every `(ob, oOrd, fuel)`" to the pair the terminus's own run produces — a
    branch some `expandBranchWithFuel` call returned open, at that call's own fuel.
    `PostBlockingSettlesRun` is that predicate, and it is the settled repair of entry 22.
    `freshWorldBranch` does not refute it, because no engine run hands that branch to the pass; the
    `fuel = 0` degeneracy that refutes the unrestricted form cannot reach it either, since
    `expandBranchWithFuel_eq_none_zero` makes its antecedent unsatisfiable there rather than
    universally satisfied (`postBlockingSettlesRun_zero`).

    *Why this is a repair where the output-branch design was not, in one line.* The output-branch
    design added conditions the consuming site had to **discharge**; the narrowed design removes
    quantifiers the consuming site never needed, and hands the site back an equation it already
    holds. `buildTableauAt_isSome_of_settlesRun` is the bridge, and it compiles for exactly that
    reason: `buildTableauAt`'s own `expandBranchWithFuel` call is in scope at the point its
    post-blocking arm is decided.

    *And what it costs.* One hypothesis becomes explicit. `PostBlockingSettles` supplied **two**
    things to the landed termini — `ArmSettlement fc`, through
    `armSettlement_of_postBlockingSettles`, for `expandBranchWithFuel`'s split folds, and the entry
    point's own arm. The narrowed residual covers only the second, so the restated termini name
    `ArmSettlement` instead of manufacturing it from a refuted predicate. That is not a new cost:
    `ArmSettlement` is a landed residual of this file, is *already* quantified the honest way — its
    own docstring is where the "restricted to arms an engine run actually hands the fold" idiom
    comes from — and was always what the fold consumed.

    *Relocating to the pass's input branch is still closed and should still not be tried*:
    `LabelFreeSaturatedExit` is false at `ob` by construction, since `buildTableauAt` runs the pass
    precisely when its guard found outstanding work there.

24. **Reading `PostBlockingSettlesRun` as discharged.** It is not, and this entry exists so the
    narrowing is not mistaken for a proof. It is a **hypothesis** everywhere it appears, exactly as
    `ArmSettlement` is, and whether it holds at the terminus's own fuel figure is open — nothing in
    this file decides it in either direction.

    *What is established about it.* It is not refuted by either witness that kills the unrestricted
    form (entry 22), and it is not vacuous: `postBlockingRunProbe`'s `#guard_msgs`-checked
    measurements run the terminus's own two calls in sequence — `expandBranchWithFuel` from a seed,
    then `saturateBlocked` on its open exit at the same fuel — and report, at every frame class and
    on propositional, temporal and world-minting seeds, that the run reaches an open exit, that the
    pass strictly extends it, and that the settlement test closes on the result. The pass doing real
    work rather than handing its input back is separately *proved*, at every frame class and every
    positive fuel, by `saturateBlocked_multBranch_one_run` with
    `multBranch_one_length_lt_multSettledBranch`.

    *What is not established, stated so the two are not confused.* The `#guard_msgs` probes are
    checked **measurements**, not kernel proofs: `expandBranchWithFuel` is compiled by well-founded
    recursion and does not reduce definitionally, so proving its half of the antecedent would mean
    transcribing an eleven-formula open exit and unfolding the equation lemma once per engine step.
    They have the same standing as `branchingWitness`'s non-vacuity `#eval` in section C7, and are
    recorded with the same honesty about what they are. Across fourteen formula shapes, four frame
    classes and three fuel figures no probed run made the settlement test fail — evidence, not a
    proof. The same sweep found `buildTableauAt`'s own guard never firing on those shapes: the
    threaded tracker and the recomputed `armTracker` agreed everywhere, so the entry point did not
    consult its post-blocking arm on any of them. That is a fact about the probe's reach, not about
    the residual.
