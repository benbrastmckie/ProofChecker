# Termination — why the tableau search terminates

Three facts, in dependency order, plus one independent ceiling. Together they guarantee that
`buildTableau` cannot exhaust its fuel on a branch that is not genuinely saturated, so the
semantic bridge (`../Bridge/`) only ever sees saturated branches rather than fuel-starved ones.

1. **T1** — expansion never invents a formula from outside a fixed finite stock.
2. **T2** — a branch whose formulas all lie in that stock has boundedly many distinguishable
   times, so a long enough chain must repeat a time type and blocking fires.
3. **T3** — T1 and T2 together give a fuel figure at which expansion cannot exhaust.

`MintBound.lean` supplies the fourth piece: T3's totality theorem is scoped to runs that never
branch, and lifting that scope needs a bound on fresh-time minting that is independent of
branch structure.

## Modules

| File | Lines | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `Fuel.lean` | 2762 | T3 — justified fuel. Turns T1 and T2 into a fuel figure at which `buildTableau` cannot exhaust. |
| `MintBound.lean` | 14770 | The mint bound: an independent ceiling on fresh-time minting along a run, needed to lift T3's totality theorem beyond non-branching runs. |
| `SubformulaProperty.lean` | 1383 | T1 — the generalized signed subformula property. Without it the pigeonhole argument of `TimeTypeBound.lean` has nothing finite to count against. |
| `TimeTypeBound.lean` | 1995 | T2 — the time-type bound and the pigeonhole: a branch whose formulas lie in a `TableauClosed` stock `C` has at most `2 ^ (2 * |C|)` distinguishable times. |

## Key Results

- `expandBranchWithFuel_isSome_of_noSplit` (`Fuel.lean`) — the totality theorem for
  non-branching runs.
- The `2 ^ (2 * |C|)` time-type bound (`TimeTypeBound.lean`) — the finiteness the whole
  termination argument rests on.
