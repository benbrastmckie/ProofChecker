# Semantic rule soundness: satisfiability preservation, one rule shape at a time

This module carries the `allClosed → valid` direction of the decision procedure. That direction
is *not* a truth lemma — the truth lemma (`Verified/Bridge/IntTruth.lean`,
`Verified/Bridge/DenseTruth.lean`) runs the other way, turning a saturated **open** branch into a
countermodel. Here the obligation is the contrapositive one: a tableau rule never destroys
satisfiability, so a branch every extension of which closes was unsatisfiable to begin with.

## The satisfiability notion

A branch is a list of signed formulas carrying `Label`s — a `WorldIndex` and a `TimeIndex`, both
`Nat`. The semantics of `Formula` (`FormalSystem/Semantics/Truth.lean`) evaluates at a
*total* world history `τ` and a *time* `t : D`. So a branch is satisfied relative to three
pieces of data:

* a model `M` over a `FrameOver (TemporalOrder.of D)` — the fibre at the carrier `D`;
* an interpretation `hist : WorldIndex → WorldHistory F` of the branch's world labels, landing
  on *total* histories — this is what makes `□` (which quantifies over totality) reach every
  branch world;
* an interpretation `tv : TimeIndex → D` of the branch's time labels.

`SatState` bundles those with the two side conditions and the branch itself. The `ordResp` field
is what ties the interpretation to the engine's abstract `TimeOrdering`: every recorded
constraint `(a, b)` must be a genuine strict inequality `tv a < tv b`. Without it a rule that
mints a fresh future time could be "satisfied" by a point in the past, and the successor state
would not be a state of the successor branch the engine actually built.

## The preservation predicate

`applyRule` returns a `RuleResult × TimeOrdering`, so the preservation predicate is stated
against exactly that pair — `SatResult` — rather than against a hand-summarised notion of "the
successor branch". The four `RuleResult` constructors get the four readings the engine gives
them:

* `.linear fs` / `.persistent fs`: the single successor `fs ++ b`. The engine *consumes* the
  source formula on a `.linear` step and *keeps* it on a `.persistent` one; carrying `b` whole in
  both cases is the stronger statement, and it is the one downstream wants, since satisfiability
  passes down to sublists (`SatState.mono`).
* `.branching bss`: **some** arm `br ++ b` is satisfiable. This is the only place the disjunction
  lives, and it is why closing *all* arms is what a closed tableau needs.
* `.branchingOrdered brs`: arms carry their own replacement branch and their own ordering. Only
  `timeLinearity` returns this, and `timeLinearity` is outside `allRulesForFC`
  (`RuleSpec.timeLinearity_not_mem_allRulesForFC`), so no theorem here consumes this arm yet.
* `.notApplicable`: nothing to preserve.

Each successor is allowed to *re-choose* `hist` and `tv`. That is not slack: it is exactly what
the fresh-label rules need. `boxNeg` mints `branch.nextWorld` and must point it at the witness
history; `someFuturePos` mints `branch.nextTime` and must point it at the witness time. Both
indices are absent from `b` (`Tableau.not_mem_of_world_nextWorld`,
`Tableau.not_mem_of_time_nextTime`), so a one-point update leaves the rest of the branch
satisfied. The model `M` is *not* re-chosen by any rule.

## `CarrierProp`

`Valid`, `ValidDense`, `ValidZTime` and `ValidRTime` differ only in the side
conditions they impose on the temporal carrier `D`. `RuleSound` is therefore indexed by a
`CarrierProp` — a property of the carrier — so that the frame-class-gated rules can be stated
with the extra hypothesis they need and the base rules can be stated without one.

Only `carrierBase` is declared here. The dense, discrete and Dedekind carrier properties are
deliberately **not** declared in advance: each will be stated in the same step that proves a rule
consuming it, so that no unconsumed predicate sits in the tree unvalidated. `RuleSound.mono` is
what makes that safe — a rule proved at a weaker carrier property is available at every stronger
one, so the base family never needs restating.

## Status

**Landed — every `RuleSound` instance this file states, plus the sub-phase 7.2 assembly.** There
are 34 per-rule instances, split by the carrier property each is stated at:

- **27 at `carrierBase`**, and therefore available at every frame class via `ruleSound_base_mono`:
  the eight truth-functional rules (`andPos`, `andNeg`, `orPos`, `orNeg`, `impPos`, `impNeg`,
  `negPos`, `negNeg`); the three *label-preserving* modal rules (`boxPos`, `diamondNeg`,
  `boxTemporal`); the two fresh-world modal rules (`boxNeg`, `diamondPos`); the four temporal
  *universal* rules (`allFuturePos`, `allPastPos`, `someFutureNeg`, `somePastNeg`);
  `orderTrichotomy`; the four fresh-*time* existential rules (`allFutureNeg`, `allPastNeg`,
  `someFuturePos`, `somePastPos`); `denseIndicatorClosure`; and all four of `untlPos`, `sncePos`,
  `untlNeg`, `snceNeg`.
- **1 at `carrierDense`**: `densityRule`.
- **3 at `carrierZTime`**: `priorUZ`, `priorSZ`, `z1Rule`.
- **3 at `carrierRTime`**: `priorUGap`, `priorSGap`, `sepRule`.

The sub-phase 7.2 assembly `ruleSound_of_mem_allRulesForFC` is landed too: one induction over
`RuleSpec.mem_allRulesForFC_iff`, discharged case by case against that ledger. All of the above
are sorry-free — as is the whole of `FormalSystem/` outside `Boneyard/`, which check C3 of
`scripts/check-module-invariants.sh` pins by content as a structural-`sorry` inventory of
zero.

**Not landed**, in the assembly theorem's own words, since it states the boundary correctly at
the point of use: `ruleSound_of_mem_allRulesForFC` is the `allClosed → valid` direction's rule
half, and is *not* yet `valid_iff_allClosed` (sub-phase 7.3), which additionally needs the
fuel/termination side and the truth-lemma gate. It also says nothing about the two rules
scheduled outside `allRulesForFC` — `serialityRule` and `timeLinearity` run as stages 2 and 3 of
`expandOnce` and need their own obligations at the point where `expandOnce`, rather than
`applyRule`, is the object.

**Three obstructions are recorded below, all now closed; read each section in the past tense.**
The ordering gap the fresh-time producers were held on is closed by `OrdWithin`, which is a
hypothesis of `RuleSound`, and the four fresh-time existentials are proved against it — see "The
fresh-time producers' ordering obligation is not discharged by freshness alone" for the record of
what was measured and which remedy was taken. `untlNeg`/`snceNeg` were held on three successive
engine defects and went through once the PASSIVE arms were retired — see "`untlNeg` and `snceNeg`
— provable once the PASSIVE arms are retired". `boxNeg` and `diamondPos` were held on an unsound
engine step — see "What `boxNeg` and `diamondPos` owed, and how it was discharged" at the end of
this file.

A signed formula is satisfied by an interpretation when its sign matches the truth value the
model gives its formula at the interpreted label.

`.pos` asserts truth, `.neg` asserts falsity — the two are *not* the truth values of a single
formula and its negation, because a branch is free to leave a formula undecided at a label; it
is only the formulas it actually carries that are constrained.

An interpretation satisfying a branch together with its abstract time ordering.

The three fields are independent obligations and all three are load-bearing:

* `histTotal` — every branch world is interpreted by a *total* history. `□` quantifies over the
  total histories (`def:BL-semantics`'s box clause, `specs/paper-definitions-of-record.md`), so
  without this a `T(□A)` on the branch would say nothing about the branch's own other worlds.
  This is what carries the whole modal burden now: it replaced the former membership field when
  the box clause was retargeted to totality, and it also replaced the former shift-closure
  field, since totality is preserved by `timeShift` outright
  (`WorldHistory.isTotal_timeShift`) and so needs no closure hypothesis to make `□` behave as
  the universal modality across times as well as histories.
* `ordResp` — every recorded ordering constraint is a genuine strict inequality in `D`. This is
  what a fresh-time rule has to re-establish for the *extended* ordering it returns.
* `sat` — every signed formula on the branch is satisfied.

### Discharging `SatResult` against a computed rule output

`applyRule` is a three-discriminant `match`, so in a proof the goal's scrutinee is stuck until
the rule's output is computed. These three lemmas take that computation as their first argument —
in practice a one-line `by simp [applyRule, …]` — and reduce `SatResult` to the obligation the
arm actually carries. Without them every proof below would have to rewrite the goal in place and
then coax the anonymous constructor through a stuck `match`.

    SatResult M b res.1 res.2 := by

## Carrier properties and the rule-soundness predicate
-/

they impose, so indexing `RuleSound` by one lets the frame-class-gated rules carry their own
hypothesis while the base rules carry none. -/
def CarrierProp : Type 1 :=
  (D : Type) → [AddCommGroup D] → [LinearOrder D] → [IsOrderedAddMonoid D] → [Nontrivial D] → Prop

/-- The empty carrier property: what a `.Base` rule may assume about `D`, namely nothing beyond
the ordered-group structure every validity notion already binds. -/
def carrierBase : CarrierProp := fun _ => True

/-- Density of the carrier, as the `.Dense` rules consume it. Stated as `DenselyOrdered D`
rather than as an unfolded betweenness statement so that the eventual assembly can discharge it
from `ValidDense`'s own `[DenselyOrdered D]` binder (`Semantics/Validity.lean`) by
`inferInstance`, with no bridging lemma in between.

Declared here but consumed by exactly one rule so far — `densityRule`, the only `.Dense` rule
that mints a time. `denseIndicatorClosure` is the other `.Dense` rule and needs *no* carrier
property: it is proved at `carrierBase` and reused through `RuleSound.mono`. -/
def carrierDense : CarrierProp := fun D => DenselyOrdered D

### Well-formedness of the `(branch, ordering)` pair

`RuleSound` quantifies over `b` and `ord` independently, and `SatState`'s four fields relate the
times occurring in `ord.constraints` to the times occurring in `b` in none of them. Without a
condition tying the two together the predicate is *false* for every fresh-time producer:
`Branch.nextTime` is a function of the branch alone, so an adversarial `ord` may already record
it, and the successor's `ordResp` obligation then demands a cycle. That is proved below
(`addFuture_nextTime_cycle_unsatisfiable` and its past mirror) rather than argued.

`OrdWithin` is the condition. Two formulations were considered:

* the numeric bound `∀ p ∈ ord.constraints, p.1 < b.nextTime ∧ p.2 < b.nextTime`, and
* the membership condition below.

The numeric bound is **not an inductive invariant of the construction**. It is preserved by 35 of
the 36 `TableauRule` constructors and was refuted by the identification arm of `timeLinearity`
(`Tableau.lean`, the `.branchingOrdered` arm), the engine's single non-additive step:
`Branch.identifyTime` *removes* a time from `knownTimes` and so could **lower** `nextTime`, while
`TimeOrdering.identifyTime` carries a constraint mentioning an unrelated larger time through the
substitution unchanged. Concretely, `b = [f₀, f₇]` with `ord = ⟨[(5, 7)]⟩` satisfies the numeric
bound (`nextTime = 8`); the arm, as it then stood, identified `7` with `0`, giving `b'.nextTime = 1`
with the constraint `(5, 0)` surviving.

**That counterexample is exactly the configuration the arm's orientation now closes.** Arm 3 merges
`min t₁ t₂` into `max t₁ t₂` rather than `t₂` into `t₁`, so it retires the *smaller* numeral and
`Branch.maxTime` — hence `Branch.nextTime`, which is `maxTime + 1` by a definition nothing here
disturbs — is non-decreasing along a run (`MintBound.lean`'s `nextTime_monotone_along_run`). At
`b = [f₀, f₇]` the oriented arm identifies `0` into `7` and `nextTime` stays `8`. The paragraph is
kept rather than deleted because it records *why* the membership formulation was chosen, and the
choice remains the right one: `OrdWithin` is the invariant that survives either way, and it does so
without depending on the orientation — which is what makes the two repairs independent rather than
one propping up the other.

The membership condition is stable under exactly that operation — every time of
`ord.identifyTime t₂ t₁` is either an unchanged time of `ord` other than `t₂`, or `t₁`, which
survives in the branch — and it is strictly stronger than the numeric bound
(`OrdWithin.bound`), so the fresh-time producers lose nothing.

/--
**Semantic soundness of one tableau rule.** If the branch is satisfied and the rule's source
formula is on it, then the rule's output preserves satisfiability.

Quantifying over *all* `sf`, not only those the rule applies to, is deliberate: `applyRule`
answers `.notApplicable` on a mismatched sign or shape, and `SatResult` reads that as `True`, so
the mismatched cases cost one `simp` each rather than a side condition in the statement.

The `OrdWithin b ord` hypothesis is the well-formedness condition on the `(branch, ordering)`
pair discussed in the section above. It sits **last**, after `SatState`, and that position is
load-bearing rather than stylistic: every rule proof opens with a single positional `intro` line,
so inserting the hypothesis any earlier silently rebinds the `SatState` witness and breaks all of
them at a distance. The rules that leave the ordering untouched — the truth-functional eight, the
label-preserving modal three, the temporal universals, `orderTrichotomy`, and the two
fresh-*world* rules — never consume it; it is exactly the fresh-*time* producers that do.

## The truth-functional family

All eight rules decompose a formula whose semantics is a truth function of its parts, so all
eight proofs are the same three moves: unfold `TruthAt` at the `imp`/`bot` skeleton the derived
connective expands to, read the truth value off the sign, and hand the same interpretation back.
No rule in this family mints a label, touches the ordering, or looks at the branch, which is why
`hist`, `tv` and `ord` pass through untouched in every one of them.

The classical steps are genuine: `F(A ∧ B)` yields `F(A)` **or** `F(B)` only classically, and
likewise `T(A ∨ B)`, `T(A → B)` and the two negation rules.

## The S5 modal family

`□` quantifies over the *total* histories, and `SatState.histTotal` makes every branch world
total. That is the whole content of the two *universal* modal rules: `boxPos` reads `T(□A)` at one
label and asserts `T(A)` at every known world at the same time, and `diamondNeg` does the mirror
image for `F(◇A)`. Neither mints a label, neither touches the ordering.

`boxTemporal` is the one rule here that moves the evaluation time. `T(□A) → T(GA)` is not a
modal-logic step at all: it holds because totality is preserved by `timeShift`
(`WorldHistory.isTotal_timeShift`), which makes `□` reach across *times* as well as histories —
the semantic content of the `modal_future` (MF) axiom the rule declares as its grounding
(`RuleSpec.ruleAxioms`). Under the former membership-based box clause this was what shift-closure
of the admissible set paid for; under the totality clause it carries no side condition.
-/

/-- `◇A` is `¬□¬A`. -/

/--
**Totality carries `□` into `G`.** If `A` holds at time `t` in every *total* history, it
holds at every *later* time of any one total history.

The witness is the shifted history `τ ⊕ (s - t)`, total by `WorldHistory.isTotal_timeShift`, at
which truth at `t` is truth at `s` in `τ` (`TimeShift.timeShift_preserves_truth`). This is the
point form of `Metalogic.Soundness.modal_future_valid`, which states the same fact as the validity
of `□A → □(GA)`; it is derived here from the same primitive rather than imported, so that the
decidability tree acquires no import edge into the soundness tree.

Shift-closure is no longer a hypothesis: the shifted witness's *totality* is what `□` now
instantiates against, and totality is preserved by `timeShift` unconditionally.

## The two fresh-world modal rules

`boxNeg` and `diamondPos` mint `branch.nextWorld` and point it at a witness history. Both return
`timeOrd` **unchanged**, which is what keeps them clear of the fresh-*time* ordering gap recorded
above: the only field of `SatState` they have to re-establish by a new argument is `sat`, and the
re-choice they make is of `hist`, at a single world index absent from the branch
(`Tableau.not_mem_of_world_nextWorld`).

Each emits the same three groups: the witness, every `T(□B)` on the branch relabelled to the
fresh world, and every `F(◇B)` likewise. Groups two and three are sound because `□` quantifies
over the total histories and not over the branch's worlds — `T(□B) @ (w', t')` says `B` holds at
`t'` in *every* total history, so it says it of the witness history too, whatever world index that
history
is filed under. The two helpers below prove exactly that, once, since both rules emit the two
lists verbatim.

A third group used to be emitted — six blocks copying `T(Gφ)`, `T(Hφ)`, `F(Fφ)`, `F(Pφ)`,
`F(U ..)` and `F(S ..)` from the trigger's time into the fresh world — and it was unsound, for
the reason `applyRule`'s docstring now records: a temporal formula is evaluated along *one*
history, which is precisely what `□`/`◇` quantify over. It was removed from the engine, and its
removal is what makes the two theorems below true. They are not provable against the calculus as
it stood before that removal.
-/

/-- Everything the fresh-world rules propagate out of a `T(□B)` on the branch is satisfied at the
fresh world, whichever *total* history is filed there. -/

## The ordering bridge: from the recorded edges to the transitive closure

`SatState.ordResp` is stated on `ord.constraints` — the *edges* the engine records, one per
`addFuture`/`addPast` call. The four temporal **universal** rules consume
`timeOrd.futureOf`/`pastOf`, which is the transitive *closure* of those edges, and deliberately
so: `SignedFormula.lean`'s `futureOf` docstring records that a direct-edge reading makes
`G p → G G p` — valid over any linear order — produce an open branch. So a gap has to be crossed
before any of those four rules can be proved, and there are two places to cross it.

**The fork, and the measurement that settled it.** The alternative is to strengthen `ordResp`
itself to the closure (`t' ∈ ord.futureOf t → tv t < tv t'`), which makes the four consumers
immediate. What that costs is paid by the *producers*: every fresh-time rule — `allFutureNeg`,
`allPastNeg`, `someFuturePos`, `somePastPos`, and the `untl`/`snce` fresh-time arms — returns
`timeOrd.addFuture l.time branch.nextTime`, i.e. a new edge consed onto the constraint list, and
would then have to re-establish the closure property for the *extended* ordering. That needs a
path-factorisation lemma — every path through `(t, tNew) :: cs` either avoids the new edge or
runs through it into the sink `tNew` — which is not in the tree, and it would have to be applied
afresh at each of those six sites. Against `ordResp` as it stands, those same rules owe only
`∀ p ∈ (t, tNew) :: cs, tv p.1 < tv p.2`: the head from the witness they just chose, the tail
from the state they were handed. So the closure reasoning belongs on the consumer side, where
one lemma serves four rules, and not on the producer side, where a strictly harder one would
serve six. The field is left as it is and the bridge is built here.

The route is the one `Bridge/TemporalSaturation.lean`'s `orderDual_converse` already walks:
`bfsClosure_sound` turns closure membership into a `PathN` of between one and `100` edges, and
an induction on that path length chains the per-edge inequalities.

### The fresh-time producers' ordering obligation is not discharged by freshness alone

The bridge above is what the four temporal *universal* rules consume, and it costs the producers
nothing, because those four return `timeOrd` untouched. The six fresh-time *producers* —
`allFutureNeg`, `allPastNeg`, `someFuturePos`, `somePastPos`, and the `untl`/`snce` fresh-time
arms — are a different matter, and this subsection records a gap in `RuleSound`'s statement that
was found while attempting them, measured rather than argued.

The intended argument is the one the module docstring states: `branch.nextTime` is absent from
`b` (`Tableau.not_mem_of_time_nextTime`), so a one-point update of `tv` at the fresh index leaves
every branch formula satisfied, and the single new edge `(l.time, freshTime)` is discharged by
the witness time the update chose. **The step that fails is `ordResp` on the *tail*.**

`Branch.nextTime` is `b.maxTime + 1` (`SignedFormula.lean:380`): a function of the *branch*
alone. `SatState` has four fields and not one of them relates the times occurring in
`ord.constraints` to the times occurring in `b`. `RuleSound` quantifies over `b` and `ord`
independently. So `ord` may already mention `b.nextTime`, and since `addFuture` merely conses
(`addFuture ord t tNew = ⟨(t, tNew) :: ord.constraints⟩`, `SignedFormula.lean:685`), the
successor ordering can be cyclic — and then *no* re-choice of `tv` satisfies it, which is what
the two theorems below prove outright. The freedom `SatResult` grants the successor to re-choose
`hist` and `tv` is therefore not enough: the obligation is unsatisfiable, not merely hard.

This is a defect in the *statement*, not in the engine. The engine threads its ordering from
`TimeOrdering.empty` and only ever adds an edge to a genuinely fresh index, so every ordering it
actually builds has all its times occurring on the branch; the cyclic orderings refuted below are
not ones it constructs. **This gap is now closed, and the record below is a past-tense account of
how.** Two remedies were considered at the time, each changing a definition the then-landed rules
were stated against:

1. **A fifth `SatState` field** bounding `ord`'s times by `b.nextTime`. Measured obstruction:
   any such field mentions `b` *positively*, and `SatState.mono` (line 152) weakens `b` to a
   sublist `b'` with `b'.nextTime ≤ b.nextTime`. The field would not survive `mono`, and `mono`
   is consumed throughout. This remedy is not merely costly; it is blocked as stated.
2. **A well-formedness hypothesis on `RuleSound`** — `∀ p ∈ ord.constraints, p.1 < b.nextTime ∧
   p.2 < b.nextTime`. This survives `mono` (it is not a `SatState` field), costs the sixteen
   landed proofs one `intro` each, and is discharged at the assembly by induction from
   `TimeOrdering.empty`. It is a genuine weakening of `RuleSound` and must be approved as such.

Remedy 2 is *not* the schedule-reachability weakening that was measured and closed earlier: it
does not restrict which branches the engine builds, and it is not tailored to exclude a
counterexample. It is a well-formedness condition on the `(branch, ordering)` pair, discharged
by construction rather than assumed.

**Remedy 2 is the one that was taken**, in the membership rather than the numeric formulation:
`OrdWithin b ord` is a hypothesis of `RuleSound`, discharged at the root by `OrdWithin.empty` and
preserved by every arm of `applyRule`. See "Well-formedness of the `(branch, ordering)` pair"
earlier in this file for why membership was chosen over the numeric bound, and `OrdWithin.bound`
for the implication between them. The four fresh-time existentials are proved against it.
-/

/-- **The gap, proved.** If `ord` already records `b.nextTime` as lying *before* `t`, then the
edge `allFutureNeg` conses on closes a cycle, and the successor's `ordResp` obligation has no
solution at all — not for the `tv` it was handed, and not for any `tv` it might re-choose. -/

## The temporal universal family

Four rules, one shape. Each reads a *universal* temporal formula at a label, and copies its
matrix to every time the abstract ordering already knows to lie on the relevant side — no fresh
label, no new constraint, and the ordering passes through untouched (all four return `timeOrd`
unchanged, and all four are `.persistent`, since a universal formula is never spent).

The whole content is the bridge above plus the relevant `Truth` characterisation:
`Truth.future_iff` and `Truth.past_iff` for the two `G`/`H` rules, `Truth.some_future_iff` and
`Truth.some_past_iff` for the two `F`/`P` rules, whose negations are what the `.neg` sign
asserts. Nothing here needs shift-closure or `histTotal`: every emitted formula stays in the source
label's own world.
-/

/-!
### Point-form readings of the four temporal operators

Each is `Truth`'s characterisation applied at a single time. They exist to keep the rule proofs
free of any dependence on how `split` names the variables it binds: `Formula.allFuture` and
friends are definitions, so the hypothesis these consume arrives *unfolded*, and unification
folds it back without the proof ever having to name the matrix.

The four fresh-time producers each need the *existential* reading of their source formula: a
time, on the correct side of the trigger's, at which the inner formula takes the required truth
value. Stated as four lemmas rather than inlined because `Formula.allFuture`, `allPast`,
`someFuture` and `somePast` are all **definitions**, so at the use site the goal shows the
unfolded `imp`/`untl` skeleton and the wrapper has to be recovered by unification against a
lemma's statement — the same reason `truthAt_of_allFuture` exists rather than a `rw`.

`Formula.allFuture` and `Formula.allPast` are **definitions**, not constructors — `G A` unfolds to
`((A.neg.someFuture).neg`, an `imp`. So `cases φ` cannot separate `G A` from a general
implication, and the two `.pos` rules below cannot be driven by it the way `boxPos` is driven by
the genuine `.box` constructor. They are driven by `split` on `applyRule`'s own matcher instead,
which decides exactly the distinction the engine decides; every arm other than the rule's own
answers `.notApplicable`, which `SatResult` reads as `True`.

## `orderTrichotomy` — the linear-order content, isolated from the rule's plumbing

`orderTrichotomy` fires at a label `(w, t₁)` carrying `T(φ)` when the branch also carries `T(ψ)`
at a *sibling* time `(w, t₂)` — incomparable to `t₁` in the recorded ordering — with a common
recorded predecessor `t₀`. It splits on the three ways the two witness times can be arranged, and
emits at `(w, t₀)` one of

```
F(φ ∧ ψ)   F(φ ∧ Fψ)   F(Fφ ∧ ψ)
```

The rule is sound for the reason its name gives: `t₁` and `t₂` may be incomparable in the
*recorded* ordering, but `tv t₁` and `tv t₂` are elements of a `LinearOrder`, so `lt_trichotomy`
decides between them and each of the three outcomes lands on exactly one disjunct. Nothing about
the branch, the ordering, or the frame class enters — only that both times are interpreted above
`tv t₀` in the same history — so the content is stated here as a lemma over three points of `D`
and consumed by the rule's proof with the plumbing kept separate.
-/

/-- `φ ∧ ψ` holds where both conjuncts do. `Formula.and` is `¬(φ → ¬ψ)`, so this is the
double-negation step, needed three times below and stated once. -/

The three cases are `tv t₁ = tv t₂`, `tv t₁ < tv t₂` and `tv t₂ < tv t₁`, in that order, and the
witness for each disjunct is the earlier of the two times.

## The fresh-time producers

These are the rules that *mint* a time: they file a witness at `branch.nextTime` and record one
new ordering edge joining the trigger's time to it. Their obligation therefore has three parts
rather than the usual one, and each part is discharged by a different piece of the state:

* **the new edge** — `tv` is updated at the single index `freshTime`, to a value chosen on the
  strength of the source formula (`F(GA)` supplies a later time at which `A` fails, `T(FA)` a
  later time at which `A` holds, and their two past mirrors likewise). The edge holds by that
  choice.
* **the old edges** — this is where `OrdWithin` is consumed, and it is the *only* place any rule
  consumes it. A one-point update at `freshTime` leaves `tv p.1 < tv p.2` intact for an existing
  constraint `p` exactly when neither endpoint is `freshTime`, which is `OrdWithin.bound`. Without
  the hypothesis the obligation is not merely hard but unsatisfiable — see
  `addFuture_nextTime_cycle_unsatisfiable` above.
* **the branch, and the propagated formulas** — the branch is untouched by the update because no
  branch formula sits at `nextTime` (`not_mem_of_time_nextTime`). The propagated formulas split
  into three families: the *temporal* propagations, discharged by the four `truthAt_of_*` lemmas
  from the chosen time's position relative to the trigger's; and the *modal* propagations emitted
  by `boxDiamondPersistence`, discharged by `satAt_of_boxForm_time` below.

The modal family is the subtle one. Copying a formula from one time to another inside a single
world is unsound in general — that is precisely the defect that was removed from the fresh-*world*
rules. It is sound here only because the two source lists hold `T(□A)` and `F(◇A)` formulas
exclusively, whose truth conditions are universal over the total histories, and such a claim is
time-invariant because totality is preserved by `timeShift`. `mem_boxDiamondPersistence_shape` is
what makes that restriction visible across the `private` definition.
-/

/-- **A totality-universal claim is time-invariant.** If `ψ` holds at time `t` in *every* total
history, it holds at *any* time in every total history.

This is the ungated core of `truthAt_allFuture_of_box` and `truthAt_allPast_of_box`: those two
wrap this fact in `G` and `H` respectively, and each discards the direction information the
wrapper supplies. The fresh-time rules need it raw, because they move a `□` formula to a time
whose position relative to the source is recorded in the ordering rather than in the formula.

Shift-closure is not a hypothesis: `WorldHistory.isTotal_timeShift` supplies the shifted
witness's totality with no side condition. -/

/-- Everything `boxDiamondPersistence` emits is satisfied at the fresh time by the *same* history
that satisfies its source at the trigger's time.

Stated against the conclusions of `mem_boxDiamondPersistence_label` and
`mem_boxDiamondPersistence_shape` rather than against membership, because
`boxDiamondPersistence` is `private` to `Tableau.lean` and so cannot be named here. Note the
interpretation `tv'` is unconstrained: time-invariance means the fresh time's value is
irrelevant, which is why this lemma survives an arbitrary one-point update. -/

`F(GA)` says `A` fails somewhere strictly later, and that failure time is what interprets the
minted index `Branch.nextTime`. The interpretation is a one-point update, which is safe for the
branch because no branch formula sits at `nextTime`, and safe for the previously recorded
ordering constraints because `OrdWithin` puts both endpoints of each strictly below it. This is
the first of the four rules that consume the hypothesis, and the only reason it is needed. -/

## `untlPos` and `sncePos` — provable once the copy is gone

These two were blocked, and the obstruction was an unsound *engine* step rather than a missing
proof: an `untlNegProps`/`snceNegProps` block copying every negative `Until`/`Since` at the
trigger's time into the freshly minted time. The block has been deleted (see `applyRule`'s
docstring for the prohibition, and `Tests/BimodalTest/UntlSnceCopyProbe.lean` for the
measurement), and what remains is exactly the shape the four fresh-time existentials already
discharge: a witness supplied by the source formula's truth condition, plus the `T(G·)`, `F(F·)`
and `□`/`◇` families in the future direction (`T(H·)`, `F(P·)` and `□`/`◇` in the past).

The `Until` witness is *stronger* than these proofs need. `T(U(e,g))@t` supplies a witness time
`s > t` carrying `e` **and** a guard condition on all of `(t,s)`; branch 1 needs only the
witness, so the guard half is discarded. That is why only branch 1 is ever named — branch 2 is a
sound alternative the proof never has to take. The section header below records the same fact
for the `Since` mirror.

## `untlNeg` and `snceNeg` — provable once the PASSIVE arms are retired

These two were the last pair open, and like `untlPos`/`sncePos` the obstruction was an unsound
*engine* step rather than a missing proof — but three of them in succession, not one. The
`untlNegProps`/`snceNegProps` copy blocks went first; then the ACTIVE arms' self-propagated
`¬U(e,g)@fresh` / `¬S(e,g)@fresh`; and last the PASSIVE co-decomposition arms, which placed the
guard failure at the *endpoint* `t'` rather than strictly inside `(l.time, t')` and could not be
repaired without an interpolant design this tree has no termination bound for. `RuleSound` is per
rule over **both** arms, so none of the first two deletions moved the ledger on its own; the third
one is what makes these statements true. `Tableau.lean`'s two arms carry the full argument, the
refuting model and the authorization; `Tests/BimodalTest/UntlSnceCopyProbe.lean` sections B, E and
F carry the measurements.

What survives is a single arm whose obligation is the classical split, and it is discharged the
same way the four fresh-time existentials above are: a witness supplied by the source formula's
truth condition, plus the `T(G·)`, `F(F·)` and `□`/`◇` families (`T(H·)`, `F(P·)` and `□`/`◇` in
the past).

**Where these differ from `untlPos`.** `untlPos` never has to choose: its witness satisfies branch
1 outright, so branch 2 is a sound alternative the proof simply never takes (`List.mem_cons_self`
at every use). Here the arm to take is not determined by the source formula, and the choice is
genuinely two-sided — which is exactly the content of `¬U(e,g)`'s classical split. `refine` names
branch 1 in one case and branch 2 in the other, and the two dispatches are otherwise identical.

**Where the witness time comes from, and why `Nontrivial D` is consumed here.** `¬U(e,g)@A` says:
for every `s > A`, either `e` fails at `s`, or the guard fails somewhere strictly inside `(A,s)`.
It does **not** hand over a time; it constrains all of them. The construction is therefore: probe
at some arbitrary `d₀ > A`, and either `¬e@d₀` (take branch 1 at `d₀`) or a guard failure at some
`z ∈ (A,d₀)` (take branch 2 at `z`). Either way the chosen time is strictly above `A`, which is
what `ordResp_addFuture_update` needs, and the existence of the probe `d₀` is the whole of what
`Nontrivial D` buys — a nonzero `c` gives `A < A + |c|`. No `NoMaxOrder`, no density, no
`DenselyOrdered`: the fresh time is a new extreme, not an interpolant, which is precisely the
difference between this arm and the ones `densityRule` needs the carrier property for.

`exists_gt_not_untl_disj` packages that construction, and its proof is shorter than the
description: negate the goal, and the resulting "`e` and `g` both hold everywhere above `A`" is
`U(e,g)@A` on the nose.

`¬U(e,g)@t`, a strictly later time at which the event fails **or** the guard fails. Both
disjuncts are live and neither can be selected in advance, which is why `ruleSound_untlNeg`
case-splits where `ruleSound_untlPos` does not.

Note what this does **not** say: it gives a time of the prover's choosing, not one named by the
formula. That is the whole difference between the retired PASSIVE arm and the surviving ACTIVE
one — the passive arm asserted the split at a time the *branch* named, `t'`, where it is false,
since the guard failure `¬U(e,g)@t` licenses lies strictly inside `(t,t')`. -/

## The frame-class-gated rules

`denseIndicatorClosure` above needed no carrier property. `densityRule` is the first rule that
does, and it is also the first rule that mints an **interpolant** rather than a new extreme: it
returns two ordering edges, `l.time < fresh` and `fresh < t'`, where `t'` is a maximal element of
the source's recorded future. Three things follow, and all three are what the two helper variants
above exist for.

* The witness `d` is not free above `tv l.time`; it must land strictly *between* `tv l.time` and
  `tv t'`. That is exactly `DenselyOrdered D`, i.e. `carrierDense`, and it is the only place the
  property is consumed.
* `ordResp` must be re-established for **two** new edges at once, and the upper endpoint `t'` has
  to be shown untouched by the one-point update — which needs `t' ∈ b.knownTimes`, supplied by
  `mem_knownTimes_of_mem_futureOf` off `OrdWithin`.
* The propagation block excludes the rule's own source formula, so its guard carries an extra
  conjunct and matches `satAt_of_mem_gPropsExcept` rather than `satAt_of_mem_gProps`.

The gap-selection logic (`gapTargets`: maximal, unfilled) is soundness-irrelevant — any `t'` in
the recorded future would do — and is there for *termination*, as `applyRule`'s comment records.
The proof accordingly reads `t'` off the head of the filtered list and forgets the filter.
-/

/-- `T(Gψ)` at `t` with a maximal recorded future time `t'` gives `T(ψ)` at a fresh interpolant
strictly between them, plus the `T(G·)` propagations. The first rule to consume a carrier
property, and the first to mint a time bounded on *both* sides. -/

### The `.Discrete` family: `priorUZ`, `priorSZ`, `z1Rule`

All three are *same-label* `.persistent [newSf]` rules that return `timeOrd` **unchanged**, so
none of them consumes `OrdWithin` and none has an ordering obligation at all. What each emits is
exactly the consequent of a discreteness axiom whose antecedent the branch already carries, at
the very same label — so each proof is one instantiation of an already-proved validity lemma
followed by semantic modus ponens against `hst.sat`. There is no new mathematics here and none
should be attempted: `prior_UZ_valid`, `prior_SZ_valid` and `z1_valid`
(`Metalogic/SoundnessLemmas/FrameClassVariants.lean`) already do the `SuccOrder`/`PredOrder`
descent work, and re-deriving it inside the decidability tree would be several hundred lines of
duplicated Mathlib.

**On the import edge.** `FormalSystem.Metalogic.Soundness` remains refused, and this is *not*
that edge. `FrameClassVariants` is a different module with a different import closure —
`FrameClassVariants → {Semantics.Validity, ProofSystem.Derivation, ProofSystem.Axioms}` — and nothing anywhere in it imports `Decidability`, so there is no cycle.
The cost is a heavier build edge, not a cycle.

**Why `carrierZTime` is an `Exists` and not a conjunction of classes.** `CarrierProp` returns
`Prop`, and `DenselyOrdered` is `Prop`-valued, so `carrierDense` could be written outright.
`SuccOrder` and `PredOrder` are **data** — `Type`-valued classes — so `fun D => SuccOrder D` does
not typecheck as a `CarrierProp`. `Exists` ranges over any `Sort`, so existentially quantifying
the two structures is a legitimate `Prop`, and eliminating that `Exists` is fine because the
goal, `SatResult`, is itself a `Prop`. Each proof below opens by destructuring it and reinstating
the four instances with `haveI`.

**The other three frame-class rules are NOT landed, and the reason is not budget.** `priorUGap`,
`priorSGap` and `sepRule` (`.Dedekind`) would need `prior_U_gap_valid`, `prior_S_gap_valid` and
`sep_valid`. Those three exist **only** in `FormalSystem/Metalogic/Soundness.lean` — the module
whose import edge into this tree is refused — and `FrameClassVariants` does **not** carry them.
So the reuse argument that unblocks the discrete three does not transfer, and no
`carrierRTime` is declared here: a frame-class carrier property is declared only in the step
that consumes one, and nothing consumes that one yet.
-/

/-- Discreteness of the carrier, as the three `.Discrete` rules consume it.

Existentially quantified because `SuccOrder`/`PredOrder` are data; see the section docstring. -/
def carrierZTime : CarrierProp := fun D =>
  ∃ (hs : SuccOrder D) (hp : PredOrder D), @IsSuccArchimedean D _ hs ∧ @IsPredArchimedean D _ hp

/-- Land a `ValidZTime` conclusion where the rule-soundness proofs need it.

`ValidZTime` states truth at the inert carrier `Set.univ`, which is exactly what the
rule-soundness proofs below evaluate against, so this is `ValidIn.apply_total` at `.Discrete` and
at the frame this tree carries. It is kept as a named step so the three `.Discrete` call sites read the same as they
did when a carrier transport was still needed; it disappears with `TruthAt`'s set parameter
itself.

The four discreteness instances are bound on `D` and handed to `FrameClass.Discrete.Sat`
**positionally**, exactly as `TaskFrame.isSuccArchDiscrete_of_instances` and `sat_intro` do:
`SuccOrder` and `PredOrder` are data, so routing them back through instance synthesis at
`F.toTaskFrame.Duration.carrier` breaks against the instances the three call sites have already
fixed on `D` with `letI`. -/

### The `.Dedekind` family: `priorUGap` and `priorSGap`

These two consume a *different* carrier property and, unlike the discrete three, their semantic
content is **not** reusable from `SoundnessLemmas`. `prior_U_gap_valid` and `prior_S_gap_valid`
exist only in `FormalSystem/Metalogic/Soundness.lean`, whose import edge into this tree is
refused, and `FrameClassVariants` does not carry them. So the content is re-proved here.

That is a smaller cost than it sounds, and the reason is worth recording because it corrects a
standing estimate. The Prior-gap arguments consume **only** the least-upper-bound hypothesis and
the linear order — no `DenselyOrdered`, no `Nontrivial`, no group structure, and no
shift-closure hypothesis.
Each is a supremum construction of about thirty lines. (The blanket "re-proving the Dedekind
soundness inside the decidability tree is several hundred lines of duplicated Mathlib work"
estimate is right for the *discrete* `SuccOrder`/`PredOrder` descent, which is exactly why those
three were reused rather than re-proved; it is not right for these two.)

`sepRule`, the third `.Dedekind` rule, is a different matter, and it is landed by a different
route — see `truthAt_sep` below. Its validity genuinely needs `exists_countable_order_dense`,
which is a substantial order-theoretic development and not a thirty-line argument, so it is
**reused** from `SoundnessLemmas/Separability.lean` rather than re-proved. That reuse is
available precisely because `Separability.lean` mentions neither formulas nor truth and its only
non-Mathlib import is `Semantics/DurationClassification.lean`, itself pure order/group theory,
which keeps the import edge acyclic; the refused edge is the one into
`Metalogic/Soundness.lean`, and it stays refused. With `sepRule` proved the `.Dedekind`
family is complete.

/-- **Sep, semantic half.** `K⁺ψ ∧ ¬K⁺(ψ ∧ U(ψ,¬ψ))` at `t` gives `K⁺(K⁺ψ ∧ K⁻ψ)` at `t`.

Unlike the two Prior-gap lemmas above, this one does **not** get by on the linear order and the
least-upper-bound hypothesis. Sep is FALSE on an arbitrary densely ordered Dedekind-complete
linear order — the lexicographic square `[0,1] ×ₗₑₓ [0,1]` refutes it — so the algebraic binders
are load-bearing: `AddCommGroup`, `IsOrderedAddMonoid`, `DenselyOrdered` and `Nontrivial`
together with `h_lub` force the carrier to be Archimedean and hence separable. That is exactly
what `exists_countable_order_dense` extracts, and it is why this rule needed an import edge where
the Prior-gap pair did not.

**On the import.** `SoundnessLemmas/Separability.lean` imports Mathlib
(`Algebra.Order.Archimedean.Basic`, `Data.Set.Countable`) plus the single `FormalSystem` module
`Semantics/DurationClassification.lean`, from which it takes `archimedean_of_lub`. It mentions
neither formulas nor truth. That one edge is measured, not assumed: the transitive `FormalSystem`
closure of `DurationClassification` is exactly three modules — `Semantics.DurationClassification`,
`Semantics.TaskFrame`, `Semantics.TemporalOrder` — and contains **no** `FormalSystem.Metalogic`
module, so the edge into this tree remains acyclic and is still a strictly weaker dependency than
the `FrameClassVariants` edge already present. It is emphatically **not** an edge to
`Metalogic/Soundness.lean`, which remains refused, nor to the `WeakCanonical` tree. Mathlib
itself was searched first and does not carry this lemma in usable form: its countable-dense
results are stated for `SeparableSpace`/`OrderTopology`, and reaching them from an ordered group
is the very bridge `Separability.lean` builds by hand.

The argument is Reynolds 1992 §7 lemma 10, and it is transcribed rather than reinvented: `S` is
the ψ-region just above `t`, dense in itself because no ψ-point above `t` begins a ψ-free gap,
and each `u` above `t` carries a ψ-free interval on one side, whose point of `Q` separates `S`
below `u` from `S` above it. `sep_order` turns that into `False`. -/

## `untlNeg` and `snceNeg` — the three engine defects, and how each was closed

**Status: closed.** `ruleSound_untlPos`, `ruleSound_sncePos`, `ruleSound_untlNeg` and
`ruleSound_snceNeg` are all proved above, sorry-free. This section is retained as the measured
record of the three defects that had to be closed first: the counterexamples below are why each
repair took the shape it did, and they are load-bearing for anyone tempted to reinstate a deleted
block. **Read the whole section in the past tense.**

**The three defects and their resolutions.** Three independent defects were found in these two
rules, not two. (1) The copy block, described as Defect 1 below: deleted from the ACTIVE arms, as
it had already been from `untlPos`/`sncePos`. (2) A *third* defect, found after that deletion and
independent of it — the ACTIVE arm re-asserting its **own** `F(U(event,guard))` at the time it
had just minted, refuted over a **dense** carrier where the copy needed a discrete one: also
deleted, gated on the full conformance corpus, and measured by section D of
`Tests/BimodalTest/UntlSnceCopyProbe.lean`. That made the ACTIVE arms sound. (3) Defect 2 below,
the PASSIVE arms' endpoint co-decomposition: not repairable in place, so the PASSIVE arms were
**retired** rather than fixed. `RuleSound` is per rule over **both** arms, so neither of the
first two deletions moved the ledger on its own; the third is what made these statements true.
See "`untlNeg` and `snceNeg` — provable once the PASSIVE arms are retired" above for the
surviving single-arm proof, and `exists_gt_not_untl_disj` for the classical split it runs on.

None of the three obstructions was the ordering gap this section's predecessors were about. That
gap is closed too: `OrdWithin` is a hypothesis of `RuleSound`, and the four fresh-time
existentials above are proved against it.

**Defect 1, the copy.** The ACTIVE arm of `untlNeg`/`snceNeg` (and, before its deletion,
`untlPos`/`sncePos`)
emits an `untlNegProps` block that copies every `F(U(e', g'))` sitting at the trigger's time
*unconditionally* to the freshly minted time. `Formula.untl` is evaluated along one history and
its truth is interval-relative, so `F(U(e', g'))` at `t` does not imply `F(U(e', g'))` at a later
time. Unlike the `□`/`◇` copies that `boxDiamondPersistence` performs, there is no shift-closure
argument available: the claim is not universal over the total histories.

**The counterexample**, over `ℤ`. `RuleSound` quantifies over *all* carriers, so a refutation
over one carrier refutes the statement, and discrete time is what makes the refutation work
(see the retraction note below for why a dense carrier does not).

*Frame.* `D = ℤ`, `F.WorldState = ℤ`, `TaskRel w d u ⟺ u = w + d`. `τ` is the identity history:
total domain, `states t = t`. No admissible set has to be chosen: `τ` is total, which is the
whole of what `SatState.histTotal` asks, and totality is preserved by `timeShift`. What *is*
load-bearing is that the interpreting history be total; see the trap below.

*Valuation*, on four atoms (`event = p`, `guard = q`, `e' = r`, `g' = s`):

```
V(n,p) ⟺ n = 5     V(n,q) ⟺ n ≥ 1     V(n,r) ⟺ n ≥ 2     V(n,s) ⟺ n ≠ 1
```

which gives `U(p,q)@a ⟺ 0 ≤ a ≤ 4` (the sole `p`-witness is `5`, and `(a,5)` must avoid `0`) and
`U(r,s)@x ⟺ x ≥ 1` (for `x ≥ 1` take the witness `max(x+1,2)` over an empty guard interval; for
`x ≤ 0` every `r`-witness is `≥ 2 > 1 > x`, so `1` lies in the interval and `s@1` fails).

*Branch.* `b = [T(U(p,q))@(w₀,0), F(U(r,s))@(w₀,0)]`, `sf` the first, `ord = TimeOrdering.empty`.
`OrdWithin` holds vacuously and `SatState` holds with `tv 0 = 0`.

*Rule output.* `freshTime = b.nextTime = 1`, `newOrd = addFuture 0 1`; `gProps`, `fNegProps` and
`modalProps` are all empty, and `untlNegProps = [F(U(r,s))@(w₀,1)]`, so

```
branch1 = [T(p)@(w₀,1), F(U(r,s))@(w₀,1)]
branch2 = [T(q)@(w₀,1), T(U(p,q))@(w₀,1), F(U(r,s))@(w₀,1)]
```

*Both successors are unsatisfiable.* Write `A = tv'(0)`, `C = tv'(1)`. Carrying `b` forces
`0 ≤ A ≤ 4` and `A ≤ 0`, hence `A = 0`; `ordResp` on `newOrd` forces `C ≥ 1`. Branch 1 needs
`p@C`, i.e. `C = 5`, against the copied `¬U(r,s)@C`, i.e. `C ≤ 0`. Branch 2 needs `U(p,q)@C`,
i.e. `C ≤ 4`, together with `C ≤ 0` from the same copy, against `C ≥ 1`. A satisfiable branch is
mapped to two unsatisfiable ones, so `RuleSound carrierBase .untlPos` is false as stated. The
copy is precisely the culprit: delete `untlNegProps` and branch 1 is satisfied by `A = 0, C = 5`.
`sncePos` follows by the time-reversal mirror of this model.

**Retraction — the earlier `{1/n}` counterexample recorded here was WRONG.** It made `e'` true
exactly on `{1/n : n ≥ 1}` and `g'` false there, and argued that every admissible interpretation
of `freshTime` lies in `(0,1)` where `U(e',g')` is true. That argument fails because `SatResult`
lets the successor re-choose `tv` **wholesale**, not just at the fresh index: the fresh time's
interpretation is free anywhere above the trigger's, and on a dense carrier there is always room
above the failure point, so the successor escapes. (This is the same failure mode that sank a
still earlier single-witness draft.) A working refutation must make the region where the *source*
branch is satisfiable a single **maximal** point, leaving no room above it — which is what the
`ℤ` model does, and what no dense carrier can do. Recorded so that a third wrong version is not
attempted.

**Formalization trap.** Allow a *partial* interpreting history and the counterexample is rescued,
becoming no counterexample at all: a history with domain `(-∞,5]` kills every `r`-point above
`5`, making `¬U(r,s)@5` vacuously true and branch 1 satisfiable. This is exactly what
`SatState.histTotal` rules out, and it is why that field cannot be weakened — the refutation
depends on the interpreting history having total domain, not on any property of a designated
admissible set.

**Isolation — FIVE unsound sites, not four, and `untlNeg`/`snceNeg` carry two independent
obstructions.** The four copy blocks are one family: `untlPos`, `sncePos`, and the ACTIVE arm of
`untlNeg`/`snceNeg`. The PASSIVE arms are a **second, independent** family, and the claim
previously recorded here — that the PASSIVE arm "emits no such block, returns `timeOrd`
unchanged, and is sound; it is provable today" — is **refuted**. For `a < c`, `¬U(e,g)@a` implies
only `¬e@c ∨ ∃ z ∈ (a,c). ¬g@z`: the guard failure lies strictly *between* `a` and `c`, whereas
the arm places it *at* `c` and additionally re-asserts `¬U(e,g)@c` — the same interval-relative
propagation as the copy defect. Over `ℤ` with `e` true exactly at `3` and `g` false exactly at
`1`: `¬U(e,g)@0` holds, yet `e@3` and `g@3` are both true, so both emitted arms fail; and `¬g@1`
holds while `U(e,g)@1` is true, which independently refutes branch 2's second conjunct. A
refutation of `RuleSound carrierBase .untlNeg` using no copy block at all: same frame and
same total history,
atoms `e, g, x` with `V(n,e) ⟺ n = 3`, `V(n,g) ⟺ n ≠ 1`, `V(n,x) ⟺ n = 3`, branch
`[F(U(e,g))@(w₀,0), T(x)@(w₀,1)]` with `ord = ⟨[(0,1)]⟩` and `tv 0 = 0`, `tv 1 = 3`. The pinning
formula `T(x)@t₁` is not exotic — `someFuturePos` produces exactly that shape with exactly that
ordering constraint.

**Required behaviour, and why the two families are handled differently.**

* For `untlPos`/`sncePos` the fix was **deletion** of the copy block, on the group-3 precedent
  below — **done**, and the two rules are proved above. A guarded copy was not available:
  soundness would need `¬U(e',g')@A → ¬U(e',g')@C` for a freshly chosen `C > A`, a semantic
  condition on the model that no syntactic guard computable from `(branch, ord)` expresses.
  Deletion can only make branches *harder* to close, so its risk was under-closing, which the
  conformance corpus measures directly: all 29 rows are unchanged by the deletion. In the other
  direction the deletion is a strict gain — `UntlSnceCopyProbe.lean` row C2 shows the engine now
  returns a countermodel for the invalid `U(p,q) → U(r,s)` where it previously exhausted its
  fuel, because the copy had been closing off the branches a countermodel is read from.
* For `untlNeg`/`snceNeg` deletion was **necessary but not sufficient** — it left the PASSIVE
  defect intact, and `RuleSound` is per rule. The sound restatement would have been an
  adjacency-aware co-decomposition (mint an interpolant `z` with `t < z < t'` and emit
  `F(guard)@z`), which turns the PASSIVE arm into a fresh-time producer and so carries
  termination and completeness consequences of exactly the kind `densityRule`'s gap-selection
  comment documents. That redesign was not taken. The PASSIVE arms were **retired** instead,
  which is what made `ruleSound_untlNeg` and `ruleSound_snceNeg` provable; `Tableau.lean`'s two
  arms carry the authorization and the refuting model.

**What this does *not* affect.** Nothing above this section. The four fresh-time existentials
mint their witness the same way and are unaffected, because their propagation families are `G`/`H`
universals, `F`/`P` negatives and the `□`/`◇` copies — every one of which *is* preserved in the
required direction, which is why they went through.

## What `boxNeg` and `diamondPos` owed, and how it was discharged — RESOLVED

`ruleSound_boxNeg` and `ruleSound_diamondPos` are proved above. This section is kept as the
record of why they could not be proved before, because the reason was an unsound *engine* step
rather than a missing proof, and because the sequence of measurements that established it is the
one methodological result of this sub-phase worth keeping.

**Summary of the resolution.** Both rules emitted a third group of formulas — six blocks copying
`T(GB)`, `T(HB)`, `F(FB)`, `F(PB)`, `F(U(B,C))` and `F(S(B,C))` from the trigger's time into the
freshly minted world. That group does not preserve satisfiability, and it was *reachable*: the
engine closed the invalid `(G p) → □(G p)`. The six blocks were removed from `applyRule`, with
the full conformance corpus as the acceptance gate; `applyRule`'s docstring now carries the
prohibition against reintroducing them. With group 3 gone, what remains is groups 1 and 2, and
those are exactly what `satAt_of_mem_boxProps` and `satAt_of_mem_diaProps` discharge. The two
theorems above are therefore not merely newly proved but newly *true*.

**Three lessons, each of which overturned the previous dispatch's conclusion.**

* *A scheduling argument needs a consumption argument.* The claim that `boxNeg` never sees an
  undecomposed `T(G p)`, because the propositional rules run first, is unsound in any additive
  tableau — and this engine is additive by design (`expandOnceUnblocked` reads a `.linear` output
  as `formulas ++ b`, so no rule's source formula is ever consumed).
* *A measurement has a value and a meaning, and reusing the value reopens the question of the
  meaning.* `isValid φ = false` was read as "the engine judged `φ` invalid". It is also what
  `extractionFailed` reports — a tableau that closed, followed by a failed proof reconstruction.
  Discriminate with `isInvalid`/`getCountermodel?`, never with `isValid` alone.
* *Before pricing two branches of a fork, test what they agree on.* The fork over weakening
  `RuleSound` by a reachability hypothesis dissolved once the premise both branches shared — that
  the engine does not build the refuting branch — was measured and found false.

The probes that pin all of this are `Tests/BimodalTest/CrossWorldPropagationProbe.lean` (verdicts),
`BoxNegPreservationProbe.lean` (the step), and `BoxNegReachabilityProbe.lean` (reachability).

## The historical record

Before the engine change, both rules emitted three groups at the minted world `branch.nextWorld`:

1. the **witness** — `F(A)` for `boxNeg`, `T(A)` for `diamondPos`;
2. the **modal propagation** — every `T(□B)` and `F(◇B)` on the branch, copied to the fresh
   world at its own time;
3. the **cross-modal-temporal propagation** — every `T(GB)`, `T(HB)`, `F(FB)`, `F(PB)`,
   `F(U(B,C))` and `F(S(B,C))` *at the source label's time*, copied to the fresh world at that
   same time.

Groups 1 and 2 are exactly the argument `boxPos`/`diamondNeg` already make, plus a one-point
update of `hist` at an index absent from the branch (`Tableau.not_mem_of_world_nextWorld`).
Group 3 is not: `T(GB)` at one history says nothing *prima facie* about another history, since
`G` is evaluated inside a single history and the witness `σ` is chosen for the witness condition
alone. Discharging it means showing the witness can always be chosen to satisfy the copied
temporal formulas too, and no such argument is in the tree.

**The verdict measurement, and its limit.** `Tests/BimodalTest/CrossWorldPropagationProbe.lean`
runs the full decision procedure on the three shapes that would expose an unsound group-3 copy as
a wrong *verdict* — `(¬F p) → □(¬F p)`, `(G p) → □(G p)` and `(¬P p) → □(¬P p)`, each invalid
because some *other* total history may have a future (resp. past) `p` while `τ` has none. All three report
`false`, the correct answer, alongside a `true` control and a `false` control. That probe was
explicit that it measured verdicts and not steps, and it was right to be.

**The step has now been measured, and it is unsound.**
`Tests/BimodalTest/BoxNegPreservationProbe.lean` applies `boxNeg` directly to the branch that
verdict-row B negates into — `T(G p) @ (w₀,t₀)`, `F(□(G p)) @ (w₀,t₀)`, which is *satisfiable*
exactly because `(G p) → □(G p)` is invalid — and pins what comes back. The rule emits exactly
two formulas, both at the minted label `(w₁, t₀)`: the witness `F(G p)`, and `T(G p)` copied by
group 3 from `w₀`. Same formula, same label, opposite signs. `SatAt` reads that pair as
`TruthAt …` together with `¬ TruthAt …` at one point, so no choice of `hist` or `tv` satisfies
the successor. A satisfiable branch has been mapped to an unsatisfiable one, and therefore

* `RuleSound carrierBase .boxNeg` is **false** — `ruleSound_boxNeg` is not unproved but
  unprovable, and `diamondPos` carries an identical `tempGProps` block; and
* the assembly `∀ r ∈ allRulesForFC fc, RuleSound _ r` cannot be proved in the present shape,
  because `boxNeg` and `diamondPos` are both members of `allRulesForFC` at every frame class.

**The branch is reachable, and the escape that was hoped for is closed.**
`Tests/BimodalTest/BoxNegReachabilityProbe.lean` measures what this section previously asserted
in the other direction. The earlier text read that "no engine defect is claimed", on the ground
that the engine never applies `boxNeg` to that branch because `T(G p)` is an `imp` whose
propositional decomposition comes first. Three measurements refute it:

* **Expansion is additive.** `expandOnceUnblocked` reads a `.linear` output as `formulas ++ b`,
  so decomposing `T(G p)` never removes it, and `tempGProps` filters the branch by *shape*, with
  no regard to whether a formula has been expanded. `boxNeg` also precedes the *branching*
  propositional rules (`impPos`, `andNeg`, `orPos`) in `allRules`.
* **The rule fires.** Driven from `b0` by the engine's own selector, `boxNeg` mints the world and
  the clash appears: `T(G p)` and `F(G p)` at one label. The branch closes on that contradiction,
  and the closure reason is pinned as `contradiction` at the minted world, not a negated axiom.
* **The tableau therefore answers wrongly.** `buildTableau ((G p) → □(G p))` returns `allClosed`
  — reporting an invalid formula valid.

**And the reading of the verdict row was wrong.** `isValid` returned `false`, which this section
took for the correct verdict on an invalid formula. `decide` in fact returns **`extractionFailed`**:
the tableau closed, and proof extraction then failed. `isInvalid` is `false` and
`getCountermodel?` is `none`. `isValid`'s `false` conflates "judged invalid" with "claimed valid,
then could not build the proof term", and only the second occurred. The distinction between
"the step is unsound" and "the procedure answers wrongly" was the right distinction to insist on;
what was wrong was believing the second had been measured and found clean.

**What this costs.** There is no branch invariant that admits the branches the engine builds and
excludes the refuting one, because they are the same branch — so weakening `RuleSound` by a
reachability hypothesis cannot work, and that fork is closed rather than open. Group 3 is
unsound as a semantic step *and* reachable, so the only repair that makes this sub-phase's target
true is an engine change: the six group-3 blocks in `boxNeg` and `diamondPos` do not preserve
satisfiability and no hypothesis available at the rule level rescues them. Groups 1 and 2 are
sound and are not implicated. That change is outside this module — it edits `applyRule` itself —
and it must be planned rather than improvised, because removing the blocks can only make branches
*harder* to close and so risks the opposite failure on the conformance corpus. It is recorded as
a blocker rather than attempted here.

*(End of the historical record. The engine change described in that last paragraph was
subsequently made, gated on the full conformance corpus, and the two rules are proved above. Every
claim above stated in the present tense should be read as holding of the calculus **before** that
change — in particular "`RuleSound carrierBase .boxNeg` is false" was true of the old engine and
is not true now.)*

## 7.2, the assembly — every rule the engine can schedule is sound at its frame class

The per-rule ledger above is complete: all 34 `TableauRule` constructors have a `RuleSound`
theorem, each at the weakest carrier property that discharges it. This section is the single
induction the plan named, run on `mem_allRulesForFC_iff` (`Verified/RuleSpec.lean`) — the gate
that says `allRulesForFC`, the engine's hand-maintained per-formula priority list, agrees with
the declarative `ruleFrameClass` modulo the two deliberately-scheduled-elsewhere rules.

**What makes it one line of real content and 144 cases of bookkeeping.** `mem_allRulesForFC_iff`
turns membership into `r ≠ .serialityRule ∧ r ≠ .timeLinearity ∧ ruleFrameClass r ≤ fc`, which is
decidable; so with both `fc` and `r` concrete, every non-member case is `absurd h (by decide)` and
every member case is the rule's own theorem, transported along `RuleSound.mono` when the frame
class supplies more than the theorem asks for. Only two transports are non-trivial, and both are
one projection:

* `carrierBase` is `fun _ => True`, so *any* carrier property refines it. That is
  `ruleSound_base_mono`, and it carries 27 of the 34 rules — the 26 base rules plus
  `denseIndicatorClosure`, which is gated at `.Dense` but proved without using density.
* `carrierRTime` has `DenselyOrdered` as its first conjunct, deliberately (see its docstring:
  *"density is carried alongside because the `.Dedekind` frame class imposes both"*). That is what
  lets `densityRule`, proved at `carrierDense`, discharge its `.Dedekind` obligation by `hC.1` —
  and it is the only place the redundant-looking conjunct is consumed.

**Why `.Discrete` is not a superclass of `.Dense`.** `FrameClass`'s order
(`ProofSystem/Axioms.lean`) has `Base ≤ everything`, `Dense ≤ Dedekind`, and `Discrete`
comparable only to itself. So `allRulesForFC .Discrete` is the 26 base rules plus the three
Prior-Z rules and does **not** contain `densityRule` — a discrete order is not dense, and the
partial (not linear) order on frame classes is what records that.

**What this does and does not deliver.** It is the `allClosed → valid` direction's rule half:
whatever the engine picks at whatever frame class, applying it preserves satisfiability. It is
not yet `valid_iff_allClosed` (7.3), which additionally needs the fuel/termination side and the
truth-lemma gate, and it says nothing about the two rules scheduled outside `allRulesForFC` —
`serialityRule` and `timeLinearity` run as stages 2 and 3 of `expandOnce` and need their own
obligations at the point where `expandOnce`, rather than `applyRule`, is the object.
