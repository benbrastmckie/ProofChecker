# Non-compactness of the `FrameClass.RTime` consequence relation

The Dedekind sibling of `Metalogic/DiscreteNonCompactness.lean`: the set-based semantic
consequence relation for `FrameClass.RTime` is **not compact**, so genuine strong
completeness is unavailable for that class too. This settles the fourth and last row of the
`FrameClass` table, whose statements are named in `Metalogic/SetConsequence.lean`
(`CompactRTime`, `StrongCompletenessRTime`, `SatisfiableRTimeSet`).

## Why `archWitness` does not port

`DiscreteNonCompactness.lean`'s witness `archWitness p = {F p} ∪ {¬Xⁿ p : n ∈ ℕ}` is built from
`Formula.next φ = Formula.untl ⊥ φ`, and its unsatisfiability half turns on `[SuccOrder]` plus
`[IsSuccArchimedean]`: an `F p` witness `s > t` is reached from `t` in finitely many successor
steps.

Neither half survives here, and the failure is not a matter of finding a different proof. On a
densely ordered carrier `TruthAt M τ t (Formula.next φ)` asks for an `s > t` with nothing
strictly between `t` and `s`; density supplies such a point for no `t` at all, so `Xⁿ p` is
vacuously false everywhere and the witness degenerates. Nor can the `[SuccOrder]` route be
restored: a densely ordered type with no maximum admits no `SuccOrder`. A genuinely new witness
is therefore required, and only the *file shape* of the Discrete module — finitely-satisfiable
half, then unsatisfiable half — carries over.

## The witness

Fix an atom `q`, and abbreviate `Xq φ = untl ¬q (q ∧ φ)` (`qNext`): "at the next `q`-point,
`φ`". The premise set (`dedWitness`) is

  `{G(⊤ S ¬q), F(G ¬q)} ∪ {Xqⁿ⊤ : n ∈ ℕ}`

whose three parts read:

* `qGap q = G(⊤ S ¬q)` — every future point has a non-`q` point immediately before it, i.e. the
  `q`-points are *isolated from below*. This is what a supremum of `q`-points cannot satisfy.
* `qBound q = F(G ¬q)` — the `q`-points are bounded above.
* `qAlpha q n = Xqⁿ⊤` — there is a chain of at least `n` successive `q`-points into the future.

**Why the `{αₙ}` family is infinite, and load-bearing.** The single formula `G(q → F q)` ("every
`q`-point has a later one") would make `{F q, G(q → F q), F(G ¬q), G(⊤ S ¬q)}` unsatisfiable
over Dedekind-complete frames in four formulas. That set is *useless for a compactness
refutation*: it is finite, and compactness may simply hand back the whole of it. Replacing that
one formula with the ω-family of finite chain assertions `{αₙ}` is exactly what makes every
*finite* subset Dedekind-satisfiable while the whole set is not. This is the design decision
most easily lost on re-derivation.

The `Formula.and` inside `qNext` is likewise necessary: weakening `Xq φ` to `untl ¬q φ` lets the
intermediate witness point be a non-`q`-point, so `α₂` collapses to `α₁` and nested untils stop
counting.

## The two halves

* **Every finite subset is satisfiable** (`dedWitness_finitely_satisfiable`). A finite list `L`
  mentions only finitely many `αₙ`, so `N = (L.map qDepth).sum` bounds every index appearing in
  it. Over `ℝ` — built as a `ShiftSet` (`rShift`) — put `q` true exactly at the integers
  `1, …, N` and evaluate at `0`. Then `qGap` holds (integers are isolated), `qBound` holds (`q`
  fails above `N + 1`), and `αₙ` holds for every `n ≤ N` (walk `0 → 1 → ⋯ → n`).
* **The whole set is unsatisfiable** (`dedWitness_core`, `dedWitness_not_satisfiable`). The
  `αₙ` family lets one build a strictly increasing sequence of `q`-points; `qBound` bounds it;
  Dedekind completeness supplies a supremum `z`; and `qGap` at `z` demands a non-`q` interval
  immediately below `z`, which the sequence's own points violate.

**Generality of the unsatisfiable half.** `dedWitness_core` takes `hlub : F.IsComplete` and no
density binder at all: density is never used. So the witness is unsatisfiable over *every*
Dedekind-complete frame, `ℤ` included — the headline `dedWitness_not_satisfiable` merely states
that general fact at `SatisfiableRTimeSet`, where the compactness refutation consumes it.
Density is needed only for the *finite*-satisfiability half, and only because
`FrameClass.RTime` requires it of the witnessing frame.

Together these refute `CompactRTime` (`notCompactRTime`) and, by way of
`soundness_rtime`, `StrongCompletenessRTime` itself
(`notStrongCompletenessRTime`).

**No conflict with `compactDense`.** `Metalogic/Compactness.lean` proves compactness for
`FrameClass.Dense`, which forces `dedWitness q` to be satisfiable over *some* dense frame. That
frame is necessarily gappy — think `q` true at a sequence of rationals increasing to an
irrational — which is consistent precisely because the argument above exploits completeness, not
density.

## Relation to Reynolds 1992

Reynolds 1992 §9 Theorem 7 is a *weak* completeness result for this class and remains correctly
cited as such. This module does not contradict it; it explains why only the weak form is
available.

/-! ## The witness vocabulary -/

/-- `Xq φ` — "at the next `q`-point, `φ`": `untl` with guard `¬q` and event `q ∧ φ`. The `untl`
constructor is **guard-first**, so this is `untl (guard := ¬q) (event := q ∧ φ)`.

The `q ∧ _` conjunct is not decoration. Dropping it — using `untl ¬q φ` — lets the intermediate
witness point be a non-`q`-point, and then `qAlpha q 2` collapses into `qAlpha q 1`: nested
applications stop counting `q`-points. -/
def qNext (q : Atom) (φ : Formula) : Formula :=
  Formula.untl (Formula.atom q).neg (Formula.and (Formula.atom q) φ)

/-- `αₙ = Xqⁿ⊤` — "there is a chain of at least `n` successive `q`-points into the future".
The ω-family `{αₙ : n ∈ ℕ}` is the load-bearing part of the witness: see the module docstring on
why a single `G(q → F q)` will not do. -/
def qAlpha (q : Atom) (n : ℕ) : Formula := (qNext q)^[n] Formula.top

/-- `G(⊤ S ¬q)` — every future point is immediately preceded by a `¬q` interval, i.e. the
`q`-points are isolated from below. This is the clause a supremum of `q`-points cannot
satisfy. -/
def qGap (q : Atom) : Formula := (Formula.snce (Formula.atom q).neg Formula.top).allFuture

/-- `F(G ¬q)` — the `q`-points are bounded above. -/
def qBound (q : Atom) : Formula := ((Formula.atom q).neg.allFuture).someFuture

/-- The non-compactness witness for `FrameClass.RTime`:
`{G(⊤ S ¬q), F(G ¬q)} ∪ {Xqⁿ⊤ : n ∈ ℕ}`. Finitely satisfiable over `ℝ`
(`dedWitness_finitely_satisfiable`), unsatisfiable over every Dedekind-complete frame
(`dedWitness_core`). -/

/-- **Membership in `dedWitness`, unfolded once and for all.** The set is a two-element `insert`
chain unioned with a `setOf`, so every membership goal against it used to be discharged by the
same four-lemma `simp only [dedWitness, Set.mem_union, Set.mem_insert_iff,
Set.mem_singleton_iff, Set.mem_setOf_eq]` incantation, written out at each site. Tagging the
unfolding `@[simp]` retires the incantation: a plain `simp` now both introduces and eliminates
membership. The right-hand side is stated right-associated, which is the shape the `rcases`
patterns downstream consume. -/

/-- Structural depth of nested `qNext` applications, used to bound the indices appearing in a
finite sublist of `dedWitness`. The pattern is the `imp`-normal form of
`untl _ (q ∧ φ)` — `Formula.and A B` unfolds to `imp (imp A (imp B bot)) bot` — which is why the
match looks the way it does. Mirrors `nextDepth` in `Metalogic/DiscreteNonCompactness.lean`. -/

`q`-point strictly between `t` and `s` — i.e. `s` is *the next* `q`-point. The uniqueness this
gap clause provides is what the chain construction in `dedWitness_core` runs on. -/

/-! ## Unsatisfiability: only Dedekind completeness is used

`TaskFrame.IsComplete` is `∀ s, s.Nonempty → BddAbove s → ∃ x, IsLUB s x` on the nose
(`Semantics/FrameProperty.lean`), so the named binder below and its unfolded form are the same
hypothesis; the `example` records that. -/

private example (F : TaskFrame) :
    F.IsComplete = (∀ s : Set F.Duration, s.Nonempty → BddAbove s → ∃ x, IsLUB s x) := rfl

/-- **One step of the `q`-point chain.** From a point `a` satisfying every `αₙ`, the `α₁`
clause supplies *the* next `q`-point `s > a`, and `s` again satisfies every `αₙ`.

The invariant propagates because `qNext` carries a gap clause: unfolding `α₁` and `αₙ₊₁` at `a`
each yields a `q`-point with no `q`-point strictly between, and the trichotomy step `hss` plays
the two gap clauses against each other to conclude that the two points coincide. That is the
whole of the induction step; `exists_strictMono_qPoints` below iterates it.

proof. -/

**The `t < ch 0` conjunct is not decoration.** `dedWitness_core` needs `t < z` for the least
upper bound `z` in order to instantiate the `qGap` clause there, and it gets it as
`lt_of_lt_of_le (t < ch 0) (ch 0 ≤ z)`; without this conjunct the caller has no route to `t < z`
at all, because every other fact the chain supplies relates two of its own points. The chain is
indexed off by one for exactly this reason: `ch n := (c (n+1)).1`, so `ch 0` is already one
`qAlpha_step` above `t` rather than being `t` itself.

`TaskFrame.IsComplete` with **no density binder**: density is never invoked, so this covers `ℤ`
as well as `ℝ`-like carriers, and `FrameClass.RTime`'s density requirement plays no part
here.

The argument, now that the chain construction lives in `exists_strictMono_qPoints` above. The
`{αₙ}` family at `t` supplies a strictly increasing chain `ch` of `q`-points starting strictly
above `t`; `qBound` bounds that chain, completeness supplies a least upper bound `z`, and `qGap`
at `z` demands a `¬q` interval `(u, z)`. But `z` is a *least* upper bound, so some `ch n` lies in
`(u, z]`, and `ch n ≠ z` because `ch (n+1) ≤ z` is strictly above it. That `ch n` is a `q`-point
in the interval the gap clause forbids. -/

`natFrame` is unavailable here — it carries `[SuccOrder]` and `[NoMaxOrder]`, which `ℝ` cannot
supply — and `FrameOver.staticFrame` is unusable for a different reason: its task relation forces
constant-state histories, so no atom can change truth value along the timeline, which this
witness requires. The working route is `Semantics/ShiftSet.lean`, which discharges all of
`FrameOver`'s fields for any `D`-action.

`N = (L.map qDepth).sum` dominates every index `n` with `qAlpha q n ∈ L`, because `qDepth` reads
that index back off the formula (`qDepth_qAlpha`) and a single summand is at most the sum. The
model is `ℝ` with `q` at the integers `1, …, N`, evaluated at `0`.

This is the half that needs density, and it needs it only because `FrameClass.RTime` demands
it of the witnessing frame; the unsatisfiable half (`dedWitness_core`) uses completeness alone.

Note that a *finite* unsatisfiable set would refute nothing about compactness — compactness may
hand back the whole of any finite premise set. That is precisely why `dedWitness` carries the
infinite family `{αₙ}` rather than the single formula `G(q → F q)`. -/

/-! ## The two refutations -/

/-- **The `FrameClass.RTime` set-based consequence relation is not compact.** Refutes
`CompactRTime` (`Metalogic/SetConsequence.lean`).

`not_compact_of_witness` (`Metalogic/StrongCompleteness.lean`) at `dedWitness ⟨"q", none⟩`, on
the two acceptance theorems above: the witness is finitely satisfiable over `ℝ` and satisfiable
over no Dedekind-complete carrier.

The `haveI : DenselyOrdered F.Duration := hd` this proof used to carry is gone with the body it
supported. It existed to feed an instance binder further down the old hand-written argument; the
skeleton destructures no satisfiability witness here, so there is no `hd` to reinstall.

Sorry-free at exactly `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`; see the axiom audit below.

Paper: — (formalization-native refutation; the paper states no compactness claim to refute)
-/
theorem notCompactRTime : ¬ CompactRTime :=
  not_compact_of_witness (dedWitness_finitely_satisfiable ⟨"q", none⟩)
    (dedWitness_not_satisfiable ⟨"q", none⟩)

/-- **Strong completeness fails for `FrameClass.RTime`.** Refutes
`StrongCompletenessRTime` (`Metalogic/SetConsequence.lean`).

`not_strongCompleteness_of_witness` at the same witness. This is the outright refutation that
explains why only *weak* completeness (`completeness_rtime`, Reynolds 1992 §9 Theorem 7) is
available for this class — the refutation does not contradict that theorem, it accounts for its
scope.

**This proof no longer mentions `soundness_rtime`**, and so no longer needs the
`haveI : DenselyOrdered F.Duration := hd` that fed its instance binder: the skeleton's soundness
step is the class-generic `soundness_validIn`, inside `compact_of_strongCompleteness`.

Sorry-free at exactly `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`; see the axiom audit below.

Paper: — (formalization-native refutation; the paper states weak completeness only)
-/
theorem notStrongCompletenessRTime : ¬ StrongCompletenessRTime :=
  not_strongCompleteness_of_witness (dedWitness_finitely_satisfiable ⟨"q", none⟩)
    (dedWitness_not_satisfiable ⟨"q", none⟩)

/-- **Model existence fails for `FrameClass.RTime`.** Refutes `ModelExistenceRTime`
(`Metalogic/SetConsequence.lean`).

The corollary that `Metalogic/SetConsequence.lean` used to describe as "simply not drawn here":
`compact_of_modelExistence` (`Metalogic/StrongCompleteness.lean`) turns model existence into
compactness, and compactness at this class is refuted directly above. Equivalently, it is the
`mpr` of `compact_iff_modelExistence` composed with `notCompactRTime`.

**It is stated in this module, not beside `ModelExistenceRTime` in
`Metalogic/SetConsequence.lean`, for the usual import reason**: it consumes
`notCompactRTime` directly above, and this module imports `SetConsequence.lean`
rather than the other way round. That module keeps the definition and now points here for the
refutation. -/

  fun h => notCompactRTime (compact_of_modelExistence h)

#print axioms notCompactRTime

/-! ## Axiom Audit

`#print axioms notCompactRTime` above is the only in-file directive this module keeps: it is
one of the five termini named in the C2/C14 manifest contract. **The rest of this module's axiom
audit lives in `scripts/check-module-invariants.sh`'s C14 heredoc pair**, which pins
`qDepth_qAlpha`, `dedWitness_core`, `dedWitness_not_satisfiable`,
`dedWitness_finitely_satisfiable`, `notStrongCompletenessRTime`,
`modelExistenceRTime_refuted`, `qAlpha_step` and `exists_strictMono_qPoints` by exact string
equality against a recorded baseline. That is a stronger guarantee than the hand-transcribed
output block that used to sit here, which could and did drift out of step with the declarations
it claimed to report.

**`sorryAx`-free throughout.** All four headline results carry exactly the three standard
classical axioms — the identical set already carried by `notCompactZTime` and by
`completeness_rtime` itself. No new axiom is introduced and no obligation is deferred.

`qDepth_qAlpha` carries a strict *subset*, `[propext, Quot.sound]`: it is a purely structural
induction on `Formula` and never reaches for choice. That is a smaller dependency, not a larger
one, and the C14 baseline records it literally rather than rounding it up, so the audit stays
honest.

### Axiom classification

* `propext` — propositional extensionality, entering through `simp`/`omega` normalisation.
* `Classical.choice` — via the `classical` tactic, `Exists.choose` in
  `exists_strictMono_qPoints`'s chain construction, and Mathlib's `Real.exists_isLUB`.
* `Quot.sound` — quotient soundness, entering through Mathlib's `List`, `Int` and `Real` API.

None of the three is avoidable in this development, and none is specific to this module. -/
