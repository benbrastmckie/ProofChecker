# Quasimodel — Intermediate Canonical Structure

Quasimodel construction as an intermediate step in BXCanonical completeness.

A quasimodel is a partial canonical structure that satisfies the local consistency
conditions of TM frames without necessarily satisfying all global coherence requirements.
Quasimodels are used as an intermediate step before the full chronicle construction.
