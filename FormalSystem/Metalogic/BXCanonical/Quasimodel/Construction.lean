# Quasimodel Construction with Defect-Discharge

Constructs the Burgess-Xu one-step quasimodel: a finite sequence of Hintikka points
with the defect-discharge property for Until/Since formulas.

## Main Definitions

- `HintikkaStep`: The one-step relation between Hintikka points
- `UntilDefect`: A defect in a Hintikka point (Until formula present but goal absent)
- `defectCount`: Number of Until-defects in a Hintikka point
- `QuasimodelChain`: A sequence of Hintikka points with defect discharge

## Main Results

- `quasimodel_chain_exists`: Given an Until defect, a discharging chain exists
- `quasimodel_chain_guard`: The guard formula holds at all intermediate points
- `quasimodel_chain_witness`: The goal formula holds at the endpoint

/-! ## Defect Count

The termination measure for the quasimodel construction.
We count the number of Until-formulas in Sigma that are "defective" at a point
(present in the point but their goal absent). Since Sigma is finite and each
step either discharges a defect or the chain has reached its goal, the chain
must terminate in at most |Sigma| steps. -/

/-! ## Quasimodel Chain

The quasimodel chain is a finite sequence of Hintikka points h0, h1, ..., hk where:
- Each consecutive pair satisfies HintikkaStep
- The guard φ holds at h0, h1, ..., h(k-1)
- The goal ψ holds at hk
- The chain terminates because defects decrease (bounded by |Sigma|)

Instead of constructing this directly (which would require complex well-founded
recursion in Lean), we prove the existence theorem using the BXPoint infrastructure:
we construct the chain at the MCS level and project down to Hintikka points.

The key insight is that the quasimodel chain existence follows from the
BX axioms applied at the MCS level, then projected to Sigma-signatures. -/

-- A quasimodel chain for an Until formula φ U ψ starting at w.
-- This is a list of BXPoints w = v0, v1, ..., vk such that:
-- - BxLe vi v(i+1) for each i
-- - φ ∈ vi.formulas for each i < k
-- - ψ ∈ vk.formulas
-- - For all u with BxLe w u and BxLe u vk and ¬BxLe vk u, φ ∈ u.formulas
--
-- Rather than constructing this explicitly, we prove the existence of
-- the witness vk directly using the BX axiom infrastructure.

-- The quasimodel construction ultimately serves to prove the four sorry targets
-- in Frame.lean. The key mathematical content is in Realization.lean (Phase 4)
-- and LocusControl.lean (Phase 5), which lift the abstract chain to BXPoints.
--
-- For the construction phase, we establish the key intermediate lemmas that
-- the BX axioms give us at the MCS level.

/-! ## Until-Defect Set and Strict-Decrease Infrastructure

The refined `QuasimodelChain` construction tracks a "target defect"
`(φ, ψ)` (an Until-formula whose right-hand side is absent at the initial
point of the chain). Phase 3 introduces the scaffolding
required for well-founded recursion on `defectCount`:

- `untilDefectSet`: the set of Until-defects at a Hintikka point (as a `Finset`)
- `defect_count_eq_card`: the count equals the cardinality of the defect set
- `hintikka_step_defect_mono`: under a monotonicity hypothesis, defects do
  not grow along a `HintikkaStep`
- `hintikka_step_target_decrease`: if the target defect is discharged (its
  witness `ψ` enters the next point), the defect count strictly decreases

The monotonicity hypothesis (`defect_mono`) is required because the abstract
`HintikkaStep` relation does not force `h2.formulas ⊆ h1.formulas`; without
the hypothesis, unrelated Until-formulas could enter `h2` and cancel the
target discharge. The hypothesis is discharged at the realization-lifting
level in Phase 5, where the lifted `v_{i+1}` is constructed from a seed
that includes `h_i.formulas` and thus carries forward all defects that
were not explicitly discharged. -/

/-! ## Refined QuasimodelChain Type

A `QuasimodelChain` tracks a finite list of Hintikka points with consecutive
`HintikkaStep` relations, together with a **target defect** `(φ, ψ)`: an
Until-formula present at the chain's head whose witness `ψ` we aim to
eventually reach at the chain's last point.

The target-defect annotation is essential for the well-founded recursion
used in `hintikka_chain_exists` (Phase 3 remaining work): each chain-step
either discharges the target (reaches `ψ`) or carries the target forward
with a strictly-smaller defect count (under the `defect_mono` hypothesis
from Phase 5). -/

/-- A quasimodel chain with a fixed target Until-defect `(target_lhs U target_rhs)`.

    The chain is a `List (HintikkaPoint Sigma)` of length ≥ 1 with:
    - `head` carrying the target defect: `(target_lhs U target_rhs) ∈ head.formulas`
    - consecutive pairs satisfying `HintikkaStep`
    - a proof `target_present` that `target_rhs` is in the head or the target
      Until is present (bookkeeping for induction)

    This type is the Phase 3 scaffolding; Phase 3's remaining task
    (`hintikka_chain_exists`) will construct values of this type via
    well-founded recursion on `defectCount`. -/

/-! ### `hintikka_chain_exists` via step-oracle

The abstract existence theorem: given a step oracle that, at every
Hintikka point carrying the target defect but missing the witness,
produces a next point either reaching the witness or strictly
decreasing the defect count, we can build a list of Hintikka points
starting at `h0` with consecutive `HintikkaStep` relations and
`ψ` present at the last point.

This lemma is purely combinatorial: it takes the oracle as a parameter
and performs the well-founded recursion on `defectCount`. The Phase 5
realization lifting discharges the oracle by constructing steps via
Lindenbaum extension on the Phase 4 seed-consistent seed.

We use a `HintikkaRawChain` predicate on `List (HintikkaPoint Sigma)`
rather than extending `QuasimodelChain.target_at_head` all the way
through, because the oracle only guarantees the target defect at
non-terminal points. The head carries the target; interior points
carry the target (because they did not yet reach `ψ`); the last
point carries `ψ` but need not carry the target. -/

/-- A Hintikka point bundled with a concrete `BXPoint` witness whose formula
    set is a superset of the point's formulas. This is the "BXPoint-backed"
    strengthening of a `HintikkaPoint`: it lets us discharge any
    `SetConsistent` obligation on subsets of `h.formulas` via the MCS
    consistency of `w`.

    Introduced to unblock Phase 4: threading a
    `BXPoint` witness through `HintikkaStepOracle` and `hintikka_chain_exists`
    collapses the chain-step seed-consistency obligation to a one-line
    subset witness, mirroring the `h_neg_in = false` branch of
    `enriched_seed_consistent_until` in `Realization.lean`. -/

/-- The step-oracle signature: at any Hintikka point carrying the target
    Until-defect and missing the witness, one can step to a next point
    either reaching the witness or strictly decreasing the defect count
    while preserving the target defect.

    The stepped point is additionally equipped with a concrete `BXPoint`
    backing witness (the BXPoint-backed strengthening). This is what
    allows downstream Phase 4 users to discharge
    `SetConsistent` obligations on subsets of the stepped point's
    formulas via MCS consistency of the witness. -/

/-- **Phase 3 main theorem**: `hintikka_chain_exists`.

    Given a step oracle and a starting Hintikka point `h0` carrying the
    target Until-defect (plus a concrete `BXPoint` witness `w0` backing
    `h0`), there exists a raw Hintikka chain starting at `h0`, ending at
    a point where `ψ` is present, and with every point backed by a
    concrete `BXPoint` witness (`ChainWitnessed`).

    The claim is propositional (an `∃`-statement) because the `HintikkaStepOracle`
    itself is propositional; the chain data is extracted by the caller via
    `Classical.choose` if they need a `noncomputable` term. -/

/-- **Seed-consistency lemma**: any subset of a chain point's
    formulas is `SetConsistent`, provided the chain is witnessed.

    This is the lemma that unblocks Phase 4
    (`enriched_seed_consistent_until`-style reductions against a chain
    point). It mirrors the `h_neg_in = false` branch of
    `enriched_seed_consistent_until` in `Realization.lean`:

        have h_L_in_w : ∀ α ∈ L, α ∈ w.formulas := ...
        exact w.is_mcs.1 L h_L_in_w ⟨d⟩

    The one-line proof is possible because `ChainWitnessed` gives us a
    concrete `BXPoint` backing each point of the chain, so the obligation
    `SetConsistent S` for any `S ⊆ h.formulas` collapses to the MCS
    consistency of the witness. -/

    raw Hintikka chain ending at `h0`, whose head contains `ψ`, with
    every point backed by a concrete `BXPoint` witness (`ChainWitnessed`).

    Mirrors `hintikka_chain_exists` with the chain extended on the right
    (via `HintikkaRawChain.snoc`) rather than on the left: at each
    recursion step, the oracle produces a predecessor `wh'.point` of the
    current `h0`, and we recursively build a chain ending at
    `wh'.point`, then snoc `h0` onto that chain. -/

/-! ### Phase 3 adapter: `quasimodel_chain_exists`

Thin re-export of `hintikka_chain_exists` in the shape Phase 4 / Phase 5
will consume: the witnessed raw chain together with its
`ChainWitnessed` predicate returned as **separate** components, so that
downstream `realize_chain_step` proofs can destructure the witness
predicate explicitly without having to re-derive it.

**Starting `BXPoint` witness source**: at every Phase 5 call site, the
initial witness `w0 : BXPoint` is the MCS starting point supplied by
Frame.lean's Until/Since context (the point at which the eventuality
resolution obligation is raised). Concretely, for
`bx_until_eventuality_resolution` (Frame.lean:653) the starting point
is the MCS `w` at which `φ U ψ ∈ w.formulas` is witnessed, and
`h0.formulas = sigmaSignature w Sigma` by construction, so the subset
hypothesis `h0_sub` reduces to `sigma_signature_mem_witness` under
`EnrichedClosure`. The Phase 4a proof discharges this subset obligation
in its own file without modifying anything here.

Consumes (reference only, zero churn):
- `hintikka_chain_exists` : the Phase 3 main theorem proved above.
- `ChainWitnessed`        : the Phase 3 MCS-witness predicate.
- `chain_step_seed_consistent` : the landed seed-consistency lemma.

This adapter does not introduce any new axioms or sorries; it is a
propositional re-export that names the `ChainWitnessed` component at
the top level of the existential for downstream ergonomics. -/
