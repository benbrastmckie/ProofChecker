# Subformula Closure (Sigma-Closure)

Defines the finite subformula closure for the Hintikka-set quasimodel construction.
Given a target formula (e.g., `φ U ψ`), the Sigma-closure includes:
- The target and all its subformulas
- G/H enrichment for locus-control
- Negation pairing: for each f in the enriched set, neg f is also included

## Main Definitions

- `subformulas`: Compute the `Finset Formula` of all subformulas of a formula
- `SubformulaClosure`: The enriched closure needed for the quasimodel construction

/-! ## G/H Enrichment -/

/-- G/H enrichment: for each formula in S, add G(f) and H(f).

/-! ## Full Subformula Closure -/

/-- The full Sigma-closure for a target formula.
    Includes subformulas, G/H enrichment, and negation pairing.

    For each formula f in the G/H-enriched subformula set, both f and neg f
    are included. This ensures the Hintikka point maximality condition can
    be satisfied: for each f ∈ Sigma, either f or neg f is in the point.

    The result is a finite set (Finset) by construction. -/
