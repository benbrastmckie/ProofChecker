# The definable-left-gap discharge of the Until/Since guard, above

This module is the **Prior-U mirror** of `ChronicleLimitGuardWitness.lean`. Where that module
moves a guard from **above** a gap to **below** it — answering *"how far down does the guard
reach?"* — this one moves a guard from **below** a gap to **above** it: at an **unselected** real
`r`, if a formula `ψ` is eventually true below `r` (`ψ ∈ limitSetBelow m r`), then `ψ` already
holds at every rational of some interval `(r, c)` abutting `r` **from above**.

Read contrapositively, that is the statement that the `ψ`-region has no definable **left** gap at
`r`. Its consumer is the forward `untl` case of the real extension, which is handed a guard
running up to an unselected real and must continue it past the gap.

## The argument

The excluded configuration is Reynolds' **left gap**, Reynolds 1992 **printed p.175**:

> "Given a temporal formula `A`, we can define a connective `γ⁺` by saying that `γ⁺(A)` holds
> exactly when `A` remains true for a while after now but only up until a gap after which `A` is
> arbitrarily soon false. If `γ⁺(A)` is true anywhere we call the indicated gap an `A` *left gap*
> and more generally a *definable gap*. Dually there is `γ⁻` and *right gaps*."

The proof move is the one Reynolds uses in the proof of Theorem 3, **printed p.176**: "Suppose for
contradiction that `M ⊨ U'(A, B)(t)` in some Prior structure `M`. Thus `B` holds for a while up
until a gap after which `¬B` is true arbitrarily soon. By Prior-U applied to `B` we have
`M ⊨ U(¬B ∨ K⁺(¬B), B)(t)` which is the contradiction." That is taken here directly, in the
future direction, rather than through its past mirror as `limitGuardBelow_of_priorS` does. The
same discipline — **apply the gap axiom to the formula uninterruptedly true on an interval
abutting the gap, never to a witness** — governs all of Reynolds' §6 appeals, including Lemma 3
(**printed pp.176, 178**).

The decisive choice is again **which formula plays the role of `B`** — and here, as in the past
mirror, it is not a witness but the **guard** `ψ` itself. The hypothesis `hev` literally hands us
a real threshold `z < r` with `ψ` true at every rational of `(z, r)`, so at any rational
`x ∈ (z, r)` the Prior-U antecedent `U(⊤, ψ)` is free. Prior-U then supplies a rational `e > x` at
which `¬ψ ∨ K⁺(¬ψ)` holds while `ψ` holds throughout `(x, e)`; unselectedness of `r` rules out
`e = r`, and the eventual guard itself rules out `e < r`, so `r < e` and the interval `(r, e)` is
the required one.

Unselectedness of `r` is used exactly **once**, to exclude `(e : ℝ) = r`. There is no outer
`by_contra`: the argument is a direct two-case split on whether `F(¬ψ)` holds at `x`, and the
first case needs no axiom at all.

`Axiom.prior_U_gap` (`ProofSystem/Axioms.lean`) has `minFrameClass = .RTime`, so both theorems
below carry `(hfc : FrameClass.RTime ≤ fc)`. This is the third place on the route where the
Dedekind axiom layer is consumed, after `ChronicleLimitGapWitness.lean` (`prior_U_gap`, at a
witness) and `ChronicleLimitGuardWitness.lean` (`prior_S_gap`, at a guard).

## Why the obligation is real

It has no counterpart in Burgess 1982 I, whose `U`/`S` chronicle this tree's chronicle layer
transcribes: Burgess' variants table (**printed p.369**) lists only Density, Discreteness,
First/Last Element and No First/No Last Element — there is **no Dedekind or continuity variant at
all** — and every witness his construction places sits strictly between two points already
present. No point is ever placed at a gap, so the interval datum his chronicle carries never has
to survive one. Passing to the reals is exactly where that datum is lost.

## Scoping caveat: no inheritance of expressive completeness

Reynolds obtains *his* gap-facing formulas "by expressive completeness" (**printed pp.176-178**);
his Theorem 3 argument is embedded in an expressive-completeness induction, and his §6 lemmas
construct their `B` and `C` the same way. **Nothing of the kind is inherited here.** In this
module `ψ` is a **hypothesis binder**, never a constructed formula: only the Prior-U appeal is
copied, never the machinery around it. No expressive-completeness apparatus is built, assumed, or
needed, and this module introduces no new connective.

## The self-root instantiation

`cantor_bfmcs_dense_restricted_fuc` and `_buc` are stated for a restricted (closure-bounded)
predicate, but they are polymorphic in `root` and their proofs **discard** the closure-membership
argument outright. Instantiating at `root := Formula.untl α β` and discharging the side condition
with `self_mem_subformulaClosure` therefore recovers **unrestricted** Until coherence for the
Cantor dense chronicle, for every formula, without touching a single chronicle declaration. Note
the projection: this module uses the `.1` (`untl`) halves where `ChronicleLimitGuardWitness.lean`
uses the `.2` (`snce`) halves.

**The general guard gap lemma, above.**

If a rational family `m` satisfies Until coherence in both directions (unrestricted), then at any
**unselected** real `r`, a formula `ψ` that is eventually true below `r` — that is,
`ψ ∈ limitSetBelow m r` — also holds at every rational of some interval `(r, c)` abutting `r` from
above. Equivalently: the `ψ`-region has no definable **left** gap at `r`.

The proof is Reynolds 1992's Theorem 3 argument (printed p.176), applied to the **guard** `ψ`
rather than to a witness, which is what makes the Prior-U antecedent `U(⊤, ψ)` available. See the
module docstring. `Axiom.prior_U_gap` is consumed at `ψ`, whence the hypothesis `hfc`.

**The chronicle instantiation.**

The Cantor dense chronicle's families satisfy the guard-reach property above every unselected
real, at any frame class above `FrameClass.RTime`.

The unrestricted Until coherence hypotheses of `limitGuardAbove_of_priorU` are obtained by
**self-root instantiation** of `cantor_bfmcs_dense_restricted_fuc` / `_buc`: those theorems are
polymorphic in `root` and discard their closure-membership argument, so instantiating at
`root := Formula.untl α β` and discharging with `self_mem_subformulaClosure` recovers the
unrestricted statement. No chronicle declaration is modified.
