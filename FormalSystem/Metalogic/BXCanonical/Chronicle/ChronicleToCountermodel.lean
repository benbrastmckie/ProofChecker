# Chronicle-to-Countermodel Integration (Gap Elimination and Discrete Pipeline)

This file contains the discrete countermodel pipeline (succ-embedding, BFMCS on Z, etc.)
for the BX completeness theorem.

The gap elimination proof (`chronicle_gap_contradiction`) and everything downstream of it —
including `succ_cofinal`, `limitDomSubtype_isSuccArchimedean`, `succ_embed_surjective`,
`cantor_bfmcs_discrete_restricted_tc`/`_fuc`, and `dd_countermodel_chronicle_discrete` — has
been archived to `Boneyard/DeadChronicleGapElimination/ChronicleGapChainExcision.lean`. See the
tombstone note below.

The basic definitions (`LimitDomSubtype`, `limitDomSubtypeSuccOrder`, dense case,
etc.) are in `ChronicleToCountermodelBasic.lean`. This file imports both
`ChronicleToCountermodelBasic` and `GoodStructuresModelSurgery` to access the
sorry-free model surgery theorems (`gap_contradicts_prior`,
`gap_contradicts_prior_below`, `no_boundary_at_successor`) needed for gap
elimination.

## Import Architecture

The file split breaks the import cycle that previously prevented accessing
model surgery tools:
```
ChronicleToCountermodel
  -> ChronicleToCountermodelBasic  (basic definitions, no cycle)
  -> GoodStructuresModelSurgery    (sorry-free gap elimination)
     -> NEquivalence -> ChronicleExtraction -> ChronicleToCountermodelBasic
```
This is a DAG, not a cycle, because `ChronicleExtraction` now imports
`ChronicleToCountermodelBasic` instead of `ChronicleToCountermodel`.

/-! ## Gap Elimination and IsSuccArchimedean — TOMBSTONE

The whole gap-elimination chain has been ARCHIVED to
`Boneyard/DeadChronicleGapElimination/ChronicleGapChainExcision.lean`:

```
chronicle_gap_contradiction → succ_cofinal → limitDomSubtype_isSuccArchimedean
  → succ_embed_surjective → cantor_bfmcs_discrete_restricted_tc/_fuc
  → dd_countermodel_chronicle_discrete   (Chronicle)
  → countermodel_discrete_reynolds       (WeakCanonical/Transfer.lean)
```

plus the two adjacent sorry-free private helpers `limit_f_some_future_of_lt` and
`limit_f_not_G_neg_of_mem`, which had no call sites outside the moved section.

This note previously argued for retention: the chain was compile-live and "excising any of them
breaks `lake build` — keep them". That was correct about *piecemeal* excision only. Its stated
consumer, `countermodel_discrete_enriched`, had itself already been archived (to
`Boneyard/DeadChronicleGapElimination/TransferDead.lean`), leaving both surviving heads with
zero consumers, so the entire closure moved as one unit and `lake build` stayed green.

The live discrete paths are unaffected. `derivable_of_validZTime` goes through
`countermodel_discrete_reynolds_v2` (`WeakCanonical/IntegerModel/ReynoldsBridge.lean`), which
bypasses `succ_embed_surjective` and the `IsSuccArchimedean` requirement entirely; do not
confuse it with the archived, `sorryAx`-tainted `countermodel_discrete_reynolds`. The
Base-frame `completeness` goes through `WeakCanonical.countermodel_discrete`
(`WeakCanonical/GroupModel/CountermodelBase.lean`), which drops the Archimedean requirement a
different way — by building over the non-Archimedean discrete carrier `ℚ ×ₗ ℤ`, where
`succ_cofinal` is not needed and its `ℤ+ℤ` refutation is beside the point. Both are
`sorryAx`-free.

Several sorry-free declarations (notably `cantor_bfmcs_discrete_restricted_buc`,
`succ_embed_squeeze`, `succ_embed_squeeze_strict`) were orphaned by the excision and
deliberately left live.

`succ_reaches_dom_N` (dead BX pipeline stage induction, zero code consumers) was
archived to `Boneyard/SorriedDeclExcisions/SingletonSorriedDecls.lean`.

`mcs_mixed_case_absurd` and `countermodelChronicleMixed` moved to
MCSMixedCase.lean.

/-! ## Collapse-Based Discrete Pipeline

When U(T,bot) is present in all domain MCS's, the limit domain has an immediate
successor for each point. `IsSuccArchimedean` (via `limitDomSubtype_isSuccArchimedean`)
asserted that finitely many succ steps reach any larger element, and `succ_embed_surjective`
followed from it via `succ_orbit_convex`. Both are archived — see
`Boneyard/DeadChronicleGapElimination/ChronicleGapChainExcision.lean`.

The collapse equivalence below (succ-reachability) is used in auxiliary proofs.

Succ-reachability is transitive. The key argument uses injectivity of succ
iterates to reduce the composite reachability to a single direction.

If `succ^[n] a = b` and `succ^[m] b = c`, then `succ^[n+m] a = c`.
If `succ^[n] a = b` and `succ^[m] c = b`, then either `a` reaches `c` or
`c` reaches `a` (by comparing n and m, using injectivity).

Orbit convexity: if `a ≤ b ≤ succ^[n] a`, then `b` is in the orbit of `a`.
Specifically, `b = succ^[k] a` for some `k ≤ n`.

Proof by strong induction on `n`. Base case `n = 0`: `a ≤ b ≤ a` forces `b = a`.
Step: if `a ≤ b ≤ succ^[n+1] a`, either `b ≤ succ^[n] a` (use IH) or
`succ^[n] a < b ≤ succ(succ^[n] a)`. In the latter case,
`succ(succ^[n] a) ≤ b` (from `succ_le_iff` and `succ^[n] a < b`), so
`b = succ^[n+1] a`.

`LinearOrder` instance on `CollapseClass`. The quotient of a linear order
by a convex equivalence relation is linearly ordered.

The strict order `[a] < [b]` is defined as `a < b ∧ a ≁ b` (well-defined by
`collapse_class_sep`). The `≤` relation is `= ∨ <`, and totality follows
from the trichotomy on the underlying `LimitDomSubtype`.

/-! ### Direct Embedding: ℤ ↪ LimitDomSubtype

Rather than proving the full quotient order infrastructure on `CollapseClass`
(which requires establishing that succ-orbits are bounded — a property deep in
the omega-chain construction), we take a simpler approach: embed ℤ directly into
`LimitDomSubtype` using `NoMaxOrder` / `NoMinOrder` to pick witnesses.

The key observation: `forward_G` / `backward_H` hold for ANY ordered pair of
domain points (`limit_forward_G` / `limit_backward_H`), regardless of equivalence
class. So we only need a strictly increasing map `ℤ → LimitDomSubtype`, which
the existing `NoMaxOrder` / `NoMinOrder` instances provide via iterated choice.

The collapse equivalence infrastructure (above) is preserved for potential future
use in proving finer structural properties (e.g., Until/Since coherence on ℤ).

/-! ## Discrete Case: Succ-Based Embedding and BFMCS on Z

When `□(U(⊤,⊥)) ∈ A` (box discreteness), every box-equivalent MCS N has
`U(⊤,⊥)` in all its chronicle domain points. This enables a succ-based
embedding `ℤ → LimitDomSubtype` that follows the deterministic successor
structure, and a BFMCS construction on ℤ mirroring the dense case.

The key property: when `U(⊤,⊥)` holds everywhere, between consecutive
embedded points (i.e., between `succEmbed(n)` and `succEmbed(n+1)`)
there are no limit domain points (the "no-gap" property). This makes
coherence proofs work: witnesses from `limit_F_resolution`, `limit_satisfies_c5_strong`,
etc. must land on embedded points.

No-gap property: between `succEmbed(n)` and `succEmbed(n+1)`, there are no
limit domain points. This is the KEY property of the discrete case.

When `U(⊤,⊥)` holds everywhere, `limitDomSubtypeSucc` gives an IMMEDIATE successor
(no intermediate domain points). Since `succEmbed(n+1) = succ(succEmbed(n))` for
non-negative n (and symmetrically via pred for negative), the gap-free property follows.

Squeeze lemma: any domain point between `succEmbed(a)` and `succEmbed(b)`
(inclusive on both ends) is itself an embedded point `succEmbed(k)` for some `a ≤ k ≤ b`.

This is the key lemma that makes coherence proofs work without full surjectivity.
The proof is by induction on `b - a`: the no-gap property eliminates domain points
between consecutive embedded points, squeezing w to the next embedded point.

/-! ## Discrete Restricted Coherence

Restricted temporal and Until/Since coherence for `cantorBfmcsDiscrete`.
These are the three conditions bundled into `BFMCS.CanonicalCoherence` and needed by the
flow-frame completeness engine (`bundleFlow_completeness_from_neg_membership`).

The key technique: for backward coherence (BUC), the squeeze lemma maps C4
counterexample witnesses back to integers. For forward coherence (TC, FUC),
the step decomposition via BX5 self-accumulation advances the Until formula
one step at a time using the no-gap property.
