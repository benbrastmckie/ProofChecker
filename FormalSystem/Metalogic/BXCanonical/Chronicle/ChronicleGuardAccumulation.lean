# The guard-accumulation invariant

**This construction has NO source in the corpus. It is original work.**

Every declaration in this module is stated and proved from first principles. No paper, textbook
or proof sketch in the literature contains this invariant, its payoff implication, or the
falsification check against the accumulating family. The only permitted citations are recorded
below, and each is an **ADAPTED-FROM** of a *neighbouring* discipline — never a transcription of
this argument:

* **ADAPTED-FROM: Burgess 1982 I §2.10, printed pp.372-373.** The fresh-point witness placement
  ("add a single point `y` lying after `x`", `y = x+1`, `z = (x+x')/2`) is the discipline whose
  *accumulation behaviour* this invariant constrains. Burgess places points; he never asks where
  the placements converge, and nothing in his §2.10 bounds it.
* **ADAPTED-FROM: Burgess 1984 §2.7, printed pp.109-110.** The A7a far-side witness placement
  runs the completion argument in the `F`/`G` fragment, where the gap witness is placed on the far
  side with no bound whatever and **no guard to carry**. The presence of a guard is exactly what
  makes the question below non-trivial, so this is an analogy and not a source.

The *statement being discharged*, `BFMCS.LimitGuardEventual`, does have a source and it is cited
where it lives: it is the failure of Reynolds' `γ⁺` at the guard, and Reynolds' definition of `γ⁺`
and of a left gap is Reynolds 1992, **printed p.175**. That citation covers the statement only.
Nothing about the *discharge* — that is, anything in this file — may be attributed to Reynolds or
to anyone else.

## The question

`BFMCS.LimitGuardEventual` says: whenever an `untl`/`snce` formula survives into the ultrafilter
limit at an **unselected** real `r`, its guard `ψ` is *eventually* true below `r`, not merely
cofinally. Its negation is exactly an accumulation phenomenon: the `¬ψ`-points of `ℚ` pile up at
`r` from below while the obligation stays live. This module names that phenomenon, forbids it, and
proves the prohibition sufficient.

## The chosen form, and why

The invariant is `NoGuardAccumulation D m G`:

> for every guard `ψ ∈ G` and every `φ`, no subset `S₀` of the `¬ψ`-points of `D` ascends to a gap
> of `D` while `untl φ ψ` (or `snce φ ψ`) remains cofinal in the approach to that gap.

Three choices are load-bearing and are recorded so that later work can be held to them.

**1. It is conditioned on the guard's own `untl`/`snce` obligation.** An unconditional invariant —
"every `ψ` in the closure is eventually true below every gap" — is **false**: formulas genuinely
oscillate, and a development that "proves" it has proved something wrong. The condition
`CofinalBelowGap` is the ℚ-level shadow of the antecedent of `BFMCS.LimitGuardEventual`, and it is
weak enough that the ultrafilter membership implies it (`cofinalBelowGap_of_mem_limitMCSBelow`),
which is what makes the payoff go through.

**2. It is stated with no reference to `ℝ`.** A gap is not "an irrational number" here; it is a
cut of the order, spelled out in the four order-theoretic clauses of `AscendsToGap`: nonempty, no
maximum, bounded above **in `D`**, and the upper bounds **in `D`** have no minimum. For `S ⊆ ℚ`,

> "`S` accumulates at some irrational `T` from below" **iff** "there is `S₀ ⊆ S` with no maximum,
> bounded above in `ℚ`, whose set of upper bounds in `ℚ` has no minimum"

((⇐) `T := sSup S₀` is approached from below since `S₀` has no maximum, and `T ∈ ℚ` would make `T`
the least upper bound; (⇒) take `S₀ := S ∩ (T-1, T)`, whose upper bounds are `{q > T}`, which has
no minimum because `T ∉ ℚ`). The right-hand side mentions only `<`, boundedness, maxima and
minima. Hence the invariant is **invariant under any order isomorphism**, which is what
`noGuardAccumulation_transport` cashes out: an invariant established on a countable dense
sub-order `D` pulls back along an order isomorphism `ℚ ≃o D` to the invariant on all of `ℚ`, which
is the form the payoff consumes. That transport is the reason the invariant is stated relative to
a domain `D` at all, and it is why no edit to the Cantor isomorphism is needed anywhere.

**3. The domain `D` is a parameter.** Finite domains satisfy the invariant outright
(`noGuardAccumulation_of_finite`), because a set with no maximum is infinite. A one-point domain
therefore satisfies it (`noGuardAccumulation_singleton`) — there is nothing to accumulate. This is
the cheap check, and it is landed rather than asserted: a formulation that a one-point domain
already failed would be the wrong formulation, and discovering that later would waste the whole
arc.

## Alternatives considered and rejected

* *Indexing by a `Finset` of guards rather than a `Set`.* Rejected: `BFMCS.LimitGuardEventual`
  quantifies over **all** guards with no closure hypothesis (deliberately — see its docstring), so
  the payoff needs `G = Set.univ`. A `Set` parameter serves both that use and the finitely-indexed
  use, and `noGuardAccumulation_mono_guards` moves between them.
* *Stating accumulation with a real `r` and `limitSetBelow`.* Rejected: correct, but not
  order-theoretic, so it does not transport, and it could not be maintained by a construction that
  only ever manipulates a finite rational domain.
* *Taking the guard-failure points to be `{q | ψ ∉ m q}`.* Rejected in favour of the literal
  `¬ψ`-points `{q | Formula.neg ψ ∈ m q}`. Under maximal consistency the two agree, and the bridge
  is `SetMaximalConsistent.negation_complete`; but the `¬ψ` form is the one a Hintikka-style state
  class can carry, and it is the one the phrase "the `¬ψ`-points" actually denotes.

## What is *not* claimed

`familyQ_violates_noGuardAccumulation` shows the invariant **excludes** the accumulating pattern:
one atom `P`, a gap `T`, guard `ψ := ¬P` failing cofinally below `T`, and `untl P (¬P)` true
throughout. It says **nothing** about whether that pattern is realizable by a family of
Dedekind-maximal-consistent sets. Settling that needs Ehrenfeucht-Fraïssé / modal-depth machinery
which is out of scope here and is not attempted. The exclusion is what makes the invariant
non-vacuous; realizability is a separate and open question.

/-! ## The order-theoretic gap-approach predicate -/

/--
`S₀` **ascends to a gap of `D`**: purely order-theoretic, mentioning only `<`, boundedness,
maxima and minima, all relative to the domain `D`.

For `D = Set.univ` this says exactly that `S₀ ⊆ ℚ` accumulates from below at an irrational; the
equivalence is spelled out in the module docstring. Because the four clauses never mention `ℝ`,
the predicate is preserved and reflected by any order isomorphism, which is what
`noGuardAccumulation_transport` uses.

/-! ## The invariant -/

/--
The obligation `A` is **cofinal in the approach to the gap** determined by `S₀`: at every domain
point strictly below the gap there is a later domain point, still strictly below the gap, carrying
`A`.

"Strictly below the gap" is rendered order-theoretically as "strictly below some member of `S₀`",
which is correct precisely because `S₀` has no maximum.

/--
**The guard-accumulation invariant.**

For every guard `ψ ∈ G` and every event formula `φ`: no set of `¬ψ`-points of `D` ascends to a gap
of `D` while the obligation `untl ψ φ` — or its past mirror `snce ψ φ` — stays cofinal in the
approach to that gap.

The conditioning on the obligation is essential and is not a weakening for convenience: the
unconditional form ("every guard in the closure is eventually true below every gap") is false,
because formulas oscillate. See the module docstring.

**Stage 0 satisfies the invariant.** A one-point domain has nothing to accumulate.

This is the cheap check that a formulation must pass: the initial chronicle stage is a single
rational point, so the invariant it must carry has to hold there outright. It does, and for the
structural reason one wants — not because the guard set happens to be empty.

/-! ## The bridge from a real gap to the order-theoretic form -/

/--
The order-theoretic form is **implied** by the analytic one: a set of rationals lying strictly
below an unselected real `r` and cofinal there ascends to a gap of `ℚ`.

This is the (⇒) half of the characterization in the module docstring, and it is the half the
payoff needs. Unselectedness of `r` is used exactly once, to rule out that a rational upper bound
sits *at* the cut.

/-! ## The payoff implication (P1) -/

/--
**The payoff: the invariant discharges `BFMCS.LimitGuardEventual`.**

If every family of the bundle satisfies the guard-accumulation invariant on all of `ℚ` and at
every guard, then the bundle satisfies the guard-eventuality obligation at unselected reals — the
single residual of forward Until/Since coherence at `ℝ`.

The argument is the contrapositive. Suppose the guard `ψ` is *not* eventually true below the
unselected real `r`. Then its failure set is cofinal below `r`; by
`SetMaximalConsistent.negation_complete` the failures are literal `¬ψ`-points; by
`ascendsToGap_univ_of_cofinal_below` they ascend to a gap of `ℚ`; and by
`cofinalBelowGap_of_mem_limitMCSBelow` the surviving `untl`/`snce` obligation is cofinal in that
approach. That is precisely the configuration the invariant forbids.

`BFMCS.LimitGuardEventual` carries no closure hypothesis, so the guard set here is `Set.univ`;
`noGuardAccumulation_mono_guards` relates this to any finitely-indexed form.

**No source.** Original work. The statement discharged is Reynolds' `γ⁺` failure at the guard
(Reynolds 1992, printed p.175); the discharge is not Reynolds' and is attributed to no one.

/-! ## The exclusion of the accumulating family (P3) -/

/--
**The invariant excludes every accumulating guard-failure pattern.**

If the `¬ψ`-points are cofinal below an unselected real `r` while `untl ψ φ` is likewise cofinal
there, the invariant fails. This is what distinguishes a real invariant from a vacuous one: the
prohibited configuration is exhibited, in Lean, as an actual refutation of the predicate.

**The shape of the accumulating family**, as a hypothesis package at the ℚ level.

One atom `P`; a gap `T` (an unselected real); the guard `ψ := ¬P` failing cofinally below `T`
along an ascending sequence of `P`-points; and the obligation `untl P (¬P)` true at every rational
below `T`. This is the ℚ-intrinsic pattern: it is stated over `ℚ` only, so no appeal to any real
model is involved.

**This is a shape, not an existence claim.** Nothing here asserts that such a family of
Dedekind-maximal-consistent sets exists. Whether it does is open and is not settled here.

**The accumulating family violates the invariant.**

The falsification target for the construction-side sub-phases: any family of this shape is
excluded by `NoGuardAccumulation`, so an insertion discipline that produced the shape would be
detected rather than silently tolerated.

Note what is and is not shown. The invariant *excludes the pattern* — that is the whole claim. It
is emphatically **not** shown that the pattern is unrealizable at `FrameClass.Dedekind`; that
question needs Ehrenfeucht-Fraïssé / modal-depth machinery, is out of scope, and remains open.

/-! ## Order-isomorphism transport -/

/--
**The invariant transports along an order isomorphism.**

Given a strictly monotone `e : ℚ → ℚ` whose image is exactly `D`, the invariant on `D` pulls back
to the invariant on all of `ℚ` for the reindexed family `m ∘ e`. Every clause of `AscendsToGap`
and of `CofinalBelowGap` mentions only `<` and domain membership, so each transports term by term.

This is the form the payoff `limitGuardEventual_of_noGuardAccumulation` consumes, and it is why
the invariant is stated relative to a domain: an invariant maintained on a countable dense
sub-order arrives at `Set.univ` without any modification to the isomorphism itself.

/-! ## What the limit-level chronicle data does **not** imply

This section is a **negative** result, and it is established rather than asserted.

The transport of the invariant from the finite stages to the limit domain was to be built on the
data the limit chronicle exports: the strong forward and backward Until/Since conditions with
their *permanent* guard intervals (the interval datum `g` propagates into every point inserted
later, so the guard survives every subsequent insertion), together with the two
counterexample-elimination conditions. Abstracted, that data is `C5StrongData`,
`C5BackwardStrongData`, `C4Data` and `C4BackwardData` below.

The theorems that close this section show that **this data does not entail
`NoGuardAccumulation`**: there is an explicit family over `ℚ` satisfying all four conditions on
all of `ℚ` and refuting the invariant, and it refutes it by exhibiting exactly the accumulating
shape `FamilyQShape` names. So the falsification target is not merely unrefuted — it is
*realizable* against the whole of the available structural data, and any argument deriving the
invariant from that data alone is unsound.

What this leaves open is stated exactly. The refuting family is a bare `Rat → Set Formula`; it is
**not** claimed to be a family of maximal consistent sets, and nothing here settles whether the
shape is realizable at `FrameClass.Dedekind` — that is the Ehrenfeucht-Fraïssé/modal-depth
question the module docstring already records as out of scope and open. What is settled is the
*route*: the invariant cannot be obtained from the limit chronicle's order-and-interval data, so
establishing it requires content about the maximal-consistent-set values the construction assigns
to freshly inserted points, which the construction does not currently control.

**No source.** Original work. ADAPTED-FROM Burgess 1982 I §2.10, printed pp.372-373 (the
fresh-point witness placement whose accumulation behaviour is at issue); ADAPTED-FROM Burgess
1984 §2.7, printed pp.109-110 (the completion-at-a-gap shape, which runs in the `F`/`G` fragment
with no guard to carry, so the configuration refuted here does not arise there at all). The
*statement* whose discharge is blocked by this result is Reynolds' `γ⁺` failure at the guard
(Reynolds 1992, printed p.175); nothing in this section is Reynolds'.

/-! ### A monotone rational approach to a gap

Dyadic truncation. No choice and no recursion is involved: the `n`-th term is
`⌊r · 2ⁿ⌋ / 2ⁿ`, which is monotone in `n`, strictly below `r` exactly because `r` is unselected,
and cofinal below `r` because the truncation error is at most `2⁻ⁿ`.

Monotone — not strictly monotone — is all the argument needs: what is required of the approach is
that every rational below `r` have a *least* approach point above it, and non-strict monotonicity
already gives that through `Nat.find`.

/-! ### The refuting family

One atom `a`. Below the gap the obligation `U(a, ¬a)` holds everywhere; the guard `¬a` fails
exactly at the approach points, where `a` holds instead; and at or above the gap nothing holds.

The `U(a, ¬a)` obligation is discharged at every point below the gap by the *least* approach point
above it: `a` holds there, and `¬a` holds at every rational strictly in between, because no
approach point lies strictly in between. So the guard interval is genuine and permanent, and it is
nonetheless useless against the accumulation, because it always terminates below the gap.

**The invariant is not implied by the limit chronicle's data.**

There is a family over `ℚ` satisfying, on all of `ℚ`, the permanent-guard forward and backward
Until/Since conditions and both counterexample-elimination conditions — the whole of what the
limit chronicle exports — which nevertheless realizes the accumulating shape and refutes
`NoGuardAccumulation`.

Consequently no derivation of `NoGuardAccumulation Set.univ _ Set.univ` from that data can be
sound, and the transport of the invariant to the limit domain cannot be carried out on the
strength of the construction's order-and-interval content. Establishing it requires content about
which maximal consistent sets the construction assigns to freshly inserted points — content the
construction does not currently control, and which is exactly the realizability question the
module docstring records as open.
