# Chronicle Types for Burgess 1982 Construction

This module defines the chronicle data structure from Burgess 1982, Section 2,
adapted for irreflexive (strict) temporal semantics.

## Overview

A **chronicle** is a triple `(f, g, dom)` where:
- `f : Rat -> Set Formula` maps rational time points to maximal consistent sets (MCS)
- `g : Rat -> Rat -> Set Formula` maps adjacent intervals to deductively closed sets (DCS)
- `dom : Finset Rat` is the finite domain of defined time points

## Key Definitions

- `SetDeductivelyClosed`: A set of formulas closed under derivation
- `rRelation`: The r-relation from Burgess Lemma 2.3
- `rMaximal`: B is a maximal DCS with r(A, B)
- `Chronicle`: The core data structure
- `Chronicle.c0`-`c5'`: The chronicle conditions

## Design Notes

The r-relation captures Until-propagation conditions that GContent alone cannot
provide. Where GContent(A) = {phi | G(phi) in A} captures universal future
propagation, the r-relation additionally tracks which Until-obligations from A
are resolved vs. continuing in the interval set B. This is exactly why the
chronicle needs a binary interval function g(x,y) rather than the unary
GContent approach used in the existing chain construction.

## Adaptation for Open Guard Semantics

Under open guard semantics, the Until operator `phi U psi` at time t requires
a witness s > t (strict) with psi(s) and guard phi on (t,s) (open interval).
The evaluation point t is NOT in the guard interval.

Key consequences:
- BX9 (until_elim) is REMOVED: `(phi U psi) -> (phi ∨ psi)` is invalid
- until_guard axiom is REMOVED: `(phi U psi) -> phi` is invalid
- `rRelation_of_superset_mcs` and `rRelationSince_of_superset_mcs` are REMOVED (invalid)

The Burgess construction uses BX4 (connect_future), BX5 (self_accum_until),
and BX10 (until_F: phi U psi -> F(psi)) as replacements.

show fc-consistency, extend via Lindenbaum, prove box-equivalence via modal_4 + S5 collapse.
All axioms used (modal_4, modal_t, modal_5_collapse, prop_s, peirce) are Base axioms
available at any fc via `base_le`. -/

  -- Show v is fc-consistent: if some finite L ⊆ v derived ⊥ at fc,
  -- then by deduction theorem we'd get a derivation of ¬(∧L) at fc.
  -- But v is Base-maximal, so for every φ, either φ ∈ v or ¬φ ∈ v.
  -- The fc-derivation can be lifted from Base (if it only uses Base axioms)
  -- or uses fc-specific axioms. In the latter case, we can't directly conclude.
  --
  -- Alternative: since v is Base-MCS, it's also fc-consistent iff no fc-derivation
  -- from its finite subsets reaches ⊥. We prove this by showing v has the same

  --
  -- Actually, the simplest approach: extend v's Base-consistency to fc-consistency
  -- using the fact that Base-MCS implies fc-consistent (base_le means any Base

  -- Instead, we reproduce the Lindenbaum construction at fc:
  -- The seed {ψ} ∪ box_content(A) is fc-consistent (same proof as Base).
  -- Lindenbaum at fc gives an fc-MCS extending the seed.

/-! ## Deductively Closed Sets (DCS) -/

/-- A set is closed under derivation if every consequence of its elements is also in it.
This is Burgess 1982's definition of "deductively closed set" (DCS).
Note: does NOT require consistency. `Set.univ` is `ClosedUnderDerivation`. -/
def ClosedUnderDerivation (fc : FrameClass) (S : Set Formula) : Prop :=
  ∀ (L : List Formula) (φ : Formula),
    (∀ ψ ∈ L, ψ ∈ S) → (DerivationTree fc L φ) → φ ∈ S

/--
A set of formulas is **deductively closed** if it is consistent and closed
under derivation: whenever all premises of a derivation are in the set,
the conclusion is also in the set.

Every MCS is deductively closed, but not every DCS is maximal.
DCS are used for the interval function `g(x,y)` in the chronicle,
which describes the formulas that hold throughout an interval.

  x ∈ dom ∧ y ∈ dom ∧ x < y ∧ ∀ z ∈ dom, ¬(x < z ∧ z < y)

/-! ## The r-Relation (Burgess Lemma 2.3) -/

/--
The **r-relation** `rRelation A B` from Burgess Section 2.

For an MCS A and a set B (typically a DCS), `rRelation A B` holds when:
for all formulas gamma and delta, if `Until(gamma, delta) in A`,
then `delta in B` or (`gamma in B` and `Until(gamma, delta) in B`).

This captures: B is a valid continuation of A with respect to Until-obligations.
At B, either the Until-eventuality is resolved (delta holds) or the guard
continues (gamma holds and the Until persists).

Under open guard semantics, this connects to:
- BX5 (self_accum_until): phi U psi -> (phi ∧ (phi U psi)) U psi
- BX10 (until_F): phi U psi -> F(psi)
Note: BX9 (until_elim: phi U psi -> phi ∨ psi) has been REMOVED.
-/
def rRelation (A B : Set Formula) : Prop :=
  ∀ (γ δ : Formula),
    Formula.untl γ δ ∈ A →
    δ ∈ B ∨ (γ ∈ B ∧ Formula.untl γ δ ∈ B)

/--
Symmetric r-relation for Since: `rRelationSince A B`.

For all gamma, delta: if `Since(gamma, delta) in A`, then `delta in B`
or (`gamma in B` and `Since(gamma, delta) in B`).
-/
def rRelationSince (A B : Set Formula) : Prop :=
  ∀ (γ δ : Formula),
    Formula.snce γ δ ∈ A →
    δ ∈ B ∨ (γ ∈ B ∧ Formula.snce γ δ ∈ B)

/-! ## Three-Argument r-Relation (Burgess 2.3, adapted)

The three-argument r-relation r3(A, B, C) captures interval-endpoint compatibility:
B is a valid interval set between left endpoint A and right endpoint C.

The condition is: rRelation A B AND rRelationSince C B. That is, B propagates
Until-obligations from A correctly AND Since-obligations from C correctly.
This dual constraint is what makes the three-argument r-relation strictly stronger
than the two-argument version and is essential for the omega-chain invariant:
it ensures that g-values inserted between endpoints are compatible with BOTH sides.

Under Burgess's construction, r3(A, B, C) means the interval (x,y) with
f(x) = A, f(y) = C has interval set g(x,y) = B that correctly propagates
temporal obligations in both directions.
-/

/--
The **three-argument r-relation** `r3Relation A B C`: B is a valid interval set
between endpoints A (left) and C (right).

Combines forward propagation (rRelation A B) with backward propagation
(rRelationSince C B): for all Until formulas in A, B either resolves or
continues them; for all Since formulas in C, B either resolves or continues them.
-/
def r3Relation (A B C : Set Formula) : Prop :=
  rRelation A B ∧ rRelationSince C B

/--
Mirror for the Since direction: `r3RelationSince A B C` where A is
the right endpoint and C is the left endpoint.

Combines backward propagation (rRelationSince A B) with forward propagation
(rRelation C B).
-/
def r3RelationSince (A B C : Set Formula) : Prop :=
  rRelationSince A B ∧ rRelation C B

/-! ## R-Maximality -/

/--
**R-maximality**: `rMaximal A B` means B is a maximal DCS satisfying `rRelation A B`.

B is R-maximal with respect to A if:
1. B is deductively closed
2. rRelation A B holds
3. No proper DCS extension of B still satisfies rRelation A

R-maximality ensures interval sets contain as many formulas as possible
while maintaining consistency and the r-relation.
-/
def rMaximal (fc : FrameClass) (A B : Set Formula) : Prop :=
  SetDeductivelyClosed fc B ∧
  rRelation A B ∧

    B ⊂ C →

/--
**Three-argument R-maximality**: `R3Maximal A B C` means B is a maximal DCS
satisfying `r3Relation A B C`.

B is R3-maximal with respect to endpoints A and C if:
1. B is deductively closed
2. r3Relation A B C holds (both rRelation A B and rRelationSince C B)
3. No proper DCS extension of B satisfies r3Relation A - C

    B ⊂ D →
    ¬r3RelationSince A D C

/-! ## Burgess r-Relation (Content-Based)

Burgess's r-relation is fundamentally different from the codebase's `rRelation`:

- **Codebase rRelation(A, B)**: For all gamma U delta in A, either delta in B or
  (gamma in B and gamma U delta in B). This is OBLIGATION PROPAGATION: Until
  formulas from A propagate to B. MONOTONE in B.

- **Burgess r(A, beta, C)**: For all gamma in C, untl(beta, gamma) in A.
  This is CONTENT: beta is a guard such that any formula from C can serve as
  the event in an Until formula in A. ANTI-MONOTONE in B (at set level).

Neither implies the other in general.
-/

/--
**Burgess r-relation for a single element**: `burgessR A beta C` holds when
for all gamma in C, `untl(beta, gamma) in A`.
-/
def burgessR (A : Set Formula) (β : Formula) (C : Set Formula) : Prop :=
  ∀ γ ∈ C, Formula.untl β γ ∈ A

/--
**Burgess r-relation for a set**: `burgessRSet A B C` holds when
for all beta in B, `burgessR A beta C`.
-/
def burgessRSet (A B C : Set Formula) : Prop :=
  ∀ β ∈ B, burgessR A β C

/--
**Burgess r-relation for Since (single element)**: `burgessRSince A beta C` holds
when for all gamma in C, `snce(beta, gamma) in A`.
-/
def burgessRSince (A : Set Formula) (β : Formula) (C : Set Formula) : Prop :=
  ∀ γ ∈ C, Formula.snce β γ ∈ A

/--
**Burgess r-relation for Since (set)**: `burgessRSetSince A B C` holds when
for all beta in B, `burgessRSince A beta C`.
-/
def burgessRSetSince (A B C : Set Formula) : Prop :=
  ∀ β ∈ B, burgessRSince A β C

/--
**Combined Burgess r-relation**: `burgessR3 A B C` holds when
burgessRSet(A, B, C) AND burgessRSetSince(C, B, A).

This captures both forward (Until from A through B to C) and backward
(Since from C through B to A) relationships.
-/
def burgessR3 (A B C : Set Formula) : Prop :=
  burgessRSet A B C ∧ burgessRSetSince C B A

/--
**BurgessR3Maximal**: B is a maximal CUD set satisfying `burgessR3(A, B, C)`.

This is Burgess's Definition 2.5 (R-maximality) using the correct content-based
r-relation. B is maximal among all `ClosedUnderDerivation` proper extensions.

The maximality clause uses `ClosedUnderDerivation` (closed under derivation,
possibly inconsistent), matching Burgess 1982 exactly. For ANY δ not in B,
`DC(B ∪ {δ})` is `ClosedUnderDerivation` and strictly extends B, so
`¬burgessR3(A, DC(B ∪ {δ}), C)`. This gives the neg-until witness
`∃ β₀ ∈ B, ∃ γ₀ ∈ C, untl(β₀ ∧ δ, γ₀).neg ∈ A`
(Burgess p.371: "else consider B' = consequences of B ∪ {δ}").

The Zorn construction (`burgessR3Maximal_extension_exists`) works directly
over CUD sets, giving CUD-maximality by construction. No `NoUnivBurgessR3`
hypothesis is needed. The resulting B may or may not be consistent;
at finite stages g-values can be Set.univ (inconsistent).

/--
A **Chronicle** is a triple `(f, g, dom)` representing a finite temporal
model over the rationals, as defined in Burgess 1982 Section 2.

The chronicle assigns:
- An MCS `f(x)` to each rational time point x in the domain
- A DCS `g(x,y)` to each pair of adjacent time points x < y in the domain,
  representing formulas that hold throughout the interval (x,y)

  /-- Interval assignment: maps pairs (x,y) with x < y to sets of formulas -/

/-! ## Chronicle Conditions -/

/-- **C0**: Every point in the domain maps to an MCS. -/
def c0 (fc : FrameClass) (χ : Chronicle) : Prop :=
  ∀ x ∈ χ.dom, SetMaximalConsistent (fc := fc) (χ.f x)

/-- **C1**: Every pair x < y in the domain maps to a CUD set
(closed under derivation, possibly inconsistent). This matches Burgess 1982
exactly: interval sets g(x,y) are DCS = deductively closed, which does NOT
require consistency. At finite stages, g-values can be Set.univ (inconsistent)
when the interval is vacuous (adjacent points with no intermediate witnesses). -/
def c1 (fc : FrameClass) (χ : Chronicle) : Prop :=
  ∀ x y : Rat, x ∈ χ.dom → y ∈ χ.dom → x < y → ClosedUnderDerivation fc (χ.g x y)

/-- **C2**: The three-argument r-relation holds for all pairs x < y in the domain.
For x < y in dom, r3Relation(f(x), g(x,y), f(y)) holds. -/
def c2 (χ : Chronicle) : Prop :=
  ∀ x y : Rat, x ∈ χ.dom → y ∈ χ.dom → x < y → r3Relation (χ.f x) (χ.g x y) (χ.f y)

/-- **C2'**: BurgessR3Maximal for adjacent pairs (Burgess Definition 2.5).

At finite stages, g(x,y) must be a maximal DCS satisfying burgessR3(f(x), g(x,y), f(y))
for adjacent pairs (x,y). This is the CORRECT formulation matching Burgess 1982's
R-maximality requirement in C2'. Maximality ensures the interval sets contain as many
formulas as possible while maintaining the r-relation, which is needed for:
1. The C4 hard case (gamma not in g implies gamma.neg in an MCS extending g)
2. Xu's Lemma 3.2.1 (closure of B under Until/Since formation)
3. The truth lemma (g-values faithfully represent interval truth)

At the limit, the domain is dense (no adjacent pairs), so c2' is vacuously true.
The `burgessR3Maximal_exists_from_seed` theorem in RRelation.lean produces maximal
DCS from seed elements. -/
def c2' (fc : FrameClass) (χ : Chronicle) : Prop :=
  ∀ x y : Rat, Adjacent χ.dom x y →
    BurgessR3Maximal fc (χ.f x) (χ.g x y) (χ.f y)

/-- **C3**: Three-way interval decomposition (Burgess 1982, p. 372).
For all x < y < z in dom, g(x,z) = g(x,y) ∩ f(y) ∩ g(y,z).

This is the CORRECT C3 from Burgess. The three-way intersection including f(y)
is essential: it gives g(x,z) ⊆ f(y) immediately, which is the key property
for the truth lemma. The earlier two-way version (omitting f(y)) was a
transcription error that blocked 21 research rounds. -/
def c3 (χ : Chronicle) : Prop :=
  ∀ x y z : Rat, x ∈ χ.dom → y ∈ χ.dom → z ∈ χ.dom →
    x < y → y < z → χ.g x z = χ.g x y ∩ χ.f y ∩ χ.g y z

/-- **C4**: Backward counterexample condition for Until (Burgess 1982, C4a).
For all x, y in dom with x < y: if `¬(γ U δ) ∈ f(x)` and `δ ∈ f(y)`,
then there exists z in dom with `x < z < y` and `¬γ ∈ f(z)`.

In `untl γ δ`: γ is the GUARD, δ is the EVENT.
Burgess C4a checks the EVENT (δ) at f(y) and negates the GUARD (γ) at f(z).

Intuition: If Until(γ,δ) is false at x but the eventuality δ holds at some
future point y, then the guard γ must have failed somewhere between x and y --
otherwise γ would hold throughout [x,y) and δ at y, satisfying Until.

Note: Burgess C4a applies to ALL pairs x < y in the domain, not just adjacent
pairs. The adjacency restriction was a transcription error that made C4
vacuously true at the dense limit (where no adjacent pairs exist). -/
def c4 (χ : Chronicle) : Prop :=
  ∀ x y : Rat, x ∈ χ.dom → y ∈ χ.dom → x < y →
    ∀ (γ δ : Formula),
      (Formula.untl γ δ).neg ∈ χ.f x →
      δ ∈ χ.f y →
      ∃ z ∈ χ.dom, x < z ∧ z < y ∧ γ.neg ∈ χ.f z

/-- **C4'**: Backward counterexample condition for Since (mirror of C4, Burgess C4b).
For all x, y in dom with y < x: if `¬(γ S δ) ∈ f(x)` and `δ ∈ f(y)`,
then there exists z in dom with `y < z < x` and `¬γ ∈ f(z)`.

In `snce γ δ`: γ is the GUARD, δ is the EVENT.
Checks EVENT (δ) at f(y), negates GUARD (γ) at f(z).

Note: Like C4, this applies to ALL pairs y < x, not just adjacent pairs. -/

  ∀ x y : Rat, x ∈ χ.dom → y ∈ χ.dom → y < x →

      δ ∈ χ.f y →
      ∃ z ∈ χ.dom, y < z ∧ z < x ∧ γ.neg ∈ χ.f z

/-- **C5**: Forward Until witness condition.
For x in dom: if `gamma U delta in f(x)`, then there exists y in dom
with x < y such that delta in f(y) and the guard gamma holds at all
intermediate domain points. -/
def c5 (χ : Chronicle) : Prop :=
  ∀ x ∈ χ.dom,

/-! ## C3 Consequences -/

/--
Key consequence of three-way C3: g(x,z) ⊆ f(y) for x < y < z in dom.
Since g(x,z) = g(x,y) ∩ f(y) ∩ g(y,z), the intersection is contained in f(y).
This is the critical property for the truth lemma.

/-! ## ChronicleInvariant Bundle -/

/--
Bundle of chronicle invariants maintained at every finite stage of the
omega-chain construction. This replaces the previous approach of tracking
only C0.

The key insight (Burgess 1982): maintaining C0, C1, C2' (adjacent), and C3
at every finite stage enables the limit to satisfy C4/C5 (which are ensured
by counterexample elimination), and the truth lemma follows from C3 alone
(no need for g_content_chain_property).

Note: C2 (r3Relation for ALL pairs) is NOT maintained at finite stages.
It is derivable at the limit from C2' + C3 + density via Lemma 2.5
absorption (see `burgessR3_absorption` in RRelation.lean). The finite-stage
invariant only needs C2' because non-adjacent g values are defined by C3
and the r-relation for non-adjacent pairs follows from Lemma 2.5.

/--
The intersection of two DCS is deductively closed (when consistent).
If S₁ and S₂ are both deductively closed and their intersection is consistent,
then S₁ ∩ S₂ is deductively closed.

Proof: If all premises of a derivation are in S₁ ∩ S₂, they are in both S₁ and S₂.
Since both are closed under derivation, the conclusion is in both, hence in the
intersection.
