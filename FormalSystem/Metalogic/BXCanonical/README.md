# BXCanonical — Burgess-Xu Canonical Model

Canonical model construction for TM completeness at all four frame classes — Base, Dense, Discrete, and Dedekind (Burgess 1982 chronicle approach). This is the **wired completeness entry point** for the repository.

This directory implements weak completeness for all four TM logic variants using a
chronicle-based canonical model. A chronicle is a sequence of maximal consistent sets
satisfying coherence conditions that correspond to the temporal and modal structure of TM frames.
It imports `Algebraic.FlowFrame` for the generic flow-frame countermodel engine.

| `DiscreteCarrierProbe.lean` | 94 | Discrete-carrier probe over the flow-frame engine |
| `Frame.lean` | 728 | Canonical frame properties: task relation, temporal accessibility |
| `OrderedSeedConsistency.lean` | 261 | Seed consistency for the ordered chronicle construction |
| `TruthLemma.lean` | 312 | MCS-membership characterizations feeding the canonical model |

| `Quasimodel/` | — | Quasimodel intermediate construction (5 files) |

## Key Results

- `completeness` (`Completeness.lean`): every Base-valid formula is derivable in TM Base. This is
  the theorem that closed last, and the reason the tree carries no structural sorry.
- `completeness_dense` (`Completeness.lean`): every validly dense formula is derivable in TM Dense
- `completeness_discrete`: every validly discrete formula is derivable in TM Discrete
- The Dedekind route (`CompletenessDedekind.lean`, 607 lines): the real-flow construction behind
  `completeness_dedekind`, stated against `ValidDedekind`
- `TruthLemma.lean` supplies the MCS-membership characterizations the model assembly consumes:
  `bot_not_in_mcs`, `imp_iff_mcs`, `G_iff_mcs`, `H_iff_mcs`, `box_iff_mcs`, `F_from_witness`,
  `P_from_witness`, `until_forward_mcs`, `since_forward_mcs`

All of the above are `SORRY-FREE (sorryAx-free; axioms: exactly propext, Classical.choice,
Quot.sound)`.
