# LimitMCS: the limit set of a rational MCS family at a real point

This module defines the *limit set* of a family of maximal consistent sets indexed by `Rat`,
taken at an arbitrary real point, and proves that it is consistent.

The construction is the first half of the seam that carries the dense canonical model from
`Rat` to `ℝ`. The back-and-forth (Cantor) chronicle layer that produces the rational family
stays at `Rat` — Cantor's theorem needs a *countable* dense order without endpoints — and only
the carrier-generic layer beneath it moves to `ℝ`. See `Bundle/FMCSDef.lean` for the family
structure and `BXCanonical/Chronicle/ChronicleToCountermodelBasic.lean` for the rational
chronicle whose families this module consumes.

## Main definitions

- `limitSetBelow m r`: the formulas that are *eventually* in `m q` as the rational `q`
  approaches the real `r` from below.
- `limitSetAbove m r`: the past-side dual, approaching `r` from above.

## Main results

- `limitSetBelow_mono_directed` / `limitSetAbove_mono_directed`: the defining family of
  witness intervals is directed, so any finite list of members shares one witness interval.
- `limitSetBelow_consistent` / `limitSetAbove_consistent`: the limit set is `SetConsistent`
  whenever every `m q` is maximal consistent. Every finite subset is contained in a single
  `m q`, and consistency is a property of finite subsets by definition
  (`Core/MaximalConsistent.lean`, `SetConsistent`).
- `limitSetBelow_of_rat` / `limitSetAbove_of_rat`: what the rational family's own temporal
  coherence transfers into the limit set at a rational point.
- `limitMCSBelow` and `limitMCSBelow_is_mcs`: a maximal consistent set *extending*
  `limitSetBelow m r`, obtained as an ultrafilter limit of `m` along the left-neighbourhood
  filter of `r`. See "Why the limit set itself is not maximal" below.
- `limitMCSBelow_cofinal_below`: every member of `limitMCSBelow m r` is realised at rationals
  arbitrarily close below `r`. This is the descent handle the extension's temporal coherence
  needs, and it is the reason an ultrafilter limit is used rather than an arbitrary Lindenbaum
  extension.
- `limitMCSLindenbaum`: the arbitrary-extension variant, recorded for comparison.
- `fc_theorem_true_in_parametric_model`: every theorem of `fc` is true at every point of the
  parametric canonical model.

## Why the limit set itself is not maximal

`limitSetBelow m r` is consistent but **not** negation-complete, and no strengthening of the
family's coherence conditions makes it so. Negation-completeness of the limit set says: for
every formula `A` there is a threshold `z < r` past which `A` has a *constant* truth value on
the rationals in `(z, r)`. A formula whose membership pattern is dense and co-dense in every
left neighbourhood of `r` violates this while satisfying every coherence condition available,
because the coherence conditions relate membership only along the strict order.

It is tempting to read Reynolds' no-definable-gaps lemma as supplying eventual constancy. It
does not, and the distinction is the crux of this module. Reynolds (1992, §5, printed p.176)
defines `γ⁺(A)` to hold "exactly when `A` remains true for a while after now but only up until
a gap after which `A` is arbitrarily soon false", and calls the indicated gap a *definable gap*;
a Prior structure — one satisfying every substitution instance of Prior-U and Prior-S — has no
definable gaps. The hypothesis of that lemma already requires `A` to be **constantly true on an
interval abutting the gap**. Prior-U (`ProofSystem/Axioms.lean`, `Axiom.prior_U_gap`) makes the
same requirement explicitly: its antecedent is `U(⊤, φ) ∧ F(¬φ)`, and `U(⊤, φ)` says `φ` holds
throughout some initial future segment. So the axiom is vacuous on exactly the formulas that
would refute negation-completeness — those with no interval of constancy at all. "No definable
gaps" is therefore strictly weaker than "every formula is eventually constant approaching `r`",
and cannot be used to derive it.

A second, independent obstruction: Prior-U and Prior-S are statements about `untl` and `snce`.
Turning membership of a Prior instance in `m q` into a fact about membership at *other*
rationals requires Until/Since coherence for the family (`Bundle/TemporalCoherence.lean`,
`BFMCS.ForwardUntilSinceCoherent` / `BFMCS.BackwardUntilSinceCoherent`), which is not among
this module's hypotheses, and which the back-and-forth chronicle supplies only in its
*Restricted* form, scoped to the deferral closure of a single root formula.

**Route taken.** Maximality is therefore obtained by extending the consistent limit set, not by
proving it maximal. Two extensions are provided. `limitMCSLindenbaum` is the bare
`set_lindenbaum` extension; it is maximal but the choice is arbitrary, so nothing about the
extension's members descends back to the rational family. `limitMCSBelow` — the one intended for
consumers — takes the ultrafilter limit of the family along the left-neighbourhood filter of `r`
(`limitFilterBelow`). It is maximal for the same reason any ultrafilter limit is, it contains
`limitSetBelow m r` because the ultrafilter refines that filter, and, crucially, it retains the
descent handle: every one of its members is realised at rationals arbitrarily close below `r`
(`limitMCSBelow_cofinal_below`). Consumers that need to reason from a membership at an
unselected real point back to the rational family must use `limitMCSBelow` and that lemma.

## Scope of the limit construction

Reynolds (1992), §1, printed p.169, is explicit that the Prior axioms enforce a *definably*
Dedekind complete model: there may be gaps in the order, but they are not visible to temporal
formulas. Accordingly nothing here claims an order-theoretic completion; the limit set is a
purely syntactic "eventually true approaching `r`" set, and its maximality is a separate
question argued from the no-definable-gaps lemma rather than from any property of `ℝ`.

## What `limitSetBelow_of_rat` does and does not say

At a rational point `q`, the *left limit* `limitSetBelow m (q : ℝ)` is **not** equal to `m q`,
and no strengthening of the rational family's coherence conditions makes it so. Both inclusions
fail:

- `limitSetBelow m (q : ℝ) ⊆ m q` fails: an atom `P` may lie in `m p` for every rational
  `p < q` and yet not lie in `m q`. The family's coherence conditions are `forward_G` and
  `backward_H` (`Bundle/FMCSDef.lean`), both stated with *strict* inequalities, so neither
  constrains membership at `q` from membership strictly below `q`. There is no axiom of the
  shape `H φ → φ` to appeal to: `allPast` is the strict past operator.
- `m q ⊆ limitSetBelow m (q : ℝ)` fails symmetrically: membership at `q` says nothing about
  membership strictly below `q`.

What coherence *does* transfer is the whole-past and whole-future content, and that is what is
proved below: `allPast A ∈ m q` puts `A` into the set approached from below, and
`allFuture A ∈ m q` puts `A` into the set approached from above. Consumers that need genuine
agreement at rational points must select `m q` directly at rational arguments rather than
taking a one-sided limit there.

/-! ## The left-neighbourhood filter -/

/--
The **left-neighbourhood filter** of a real point `r` on the rationals: the pullback along
`Rat.cast` of `ℝ`'s neighbourhood filter within `Set.Iio r`. A set of rationals is large
exactly when it contains every rational in some interval `(z, r)` with `z < r` --
`mem_limitFilterBelow` unfolds this from Mathlib's order-topology basis for
`nhdsWithin r (Set.Iio r)`.
-/

The left-neighbourhood filter is proper: every interval `(z, r)` with `z < r` contains a
rational, by `exists_rat_btwn`.

/--
The **limit set from below** of a rational family `m` at a real point `r`: the `A`s that are
eventually in `m q` for `limitFilterBelow r` -- i.e. `A ∈ m q` for every rational `q`
sufficiently close to `r` from below.
-/

Membership in `limitSetBelow`, unfolded to the interval-threshold shape via
`mem_limitFilterBelow`. **The one unfolding lemma** every downstream file uses -- `limitSetBelow`
itself is no longer unfolded directly outside this module.

  mem_limitFilterBelow

/--
The **limit set from above** of a rational family `m` at a real point `r`: the past-side dual
of `limitSetBelow`, with the witness threshold `z` now above `r`.

Deliberately left in its pre-`Filter` hand-rolled form in this phase: `TemporalSide`
(Phase 8) is what turns this into the second instantiation of a single parameterized
`limitSet`/`limitFilter` family, at which point `limitFilterAbove` becomes the genuine dual of
`limitFilterBelow` above. Introducing a throwaway private "above" filter here just to route
`limitSetAbove_consistent` through `Filter.inter_mem` would duplicate that work early for no
lasting benefit.
-/

/-! ## Directedness of the witness intervals (above side only)

The below-side directedness argument (`limitSetBelow_mono_directed` /
`limitSetBelow_finite_subset_mem`) is retired in favour of the `Filter` route above
(`Filter.inter_mem` + `Filter.NeBot.nonempty_of_mem`, used directly in
`limitSetBelow_consistent`). The above-side pair stays -- see the `limitSetAbove` docstring.

The witness intervals of `limitSetAbove` are directed. Dual of the below-side argument that used
to stand here, with `min` in place of `max` and `r + 1` witnessing the empty list.

/-! ## Consistency of the limit sets -/

/--
**The limit set from below is consistent.**

`SetConsistent` (`Core/MaximalConsistent.lean`) is a property of finite subsets. Every finite
list drawn from `limitSetBelow m r` gives a finite intersection of `limitFilterBelow r`-large
sets, which is itself large (`Filter.inter_mem`, by induction on the list) and hence nonempty
(`Filter.nonempty_of_mem`, via the `NeBot` instance) -- so some `q` realises the whole list, and
`m q`'s own consistency finishes it.

instead.

/--
What the rational family's `backward_H` coherence transfers into the limit set from below at a
rational point: if the whole strict past of `q` is asserted at `q`, the asserted formula is in
the left limit at `q`.

The hypothesis `hH` is exactly the `backward_H` field of `FMCS` (`Bundle/FMCSDef.lean`),
specialised to `D := Rat`, and is taken as an argument so that this lemma is usable before the
real-carrier family is assembled.

/-! ## Maximality by arbitrary extension

The bare `set_lindenbaum` extension of the limit set. It is maximal, but the choice is
arbitrary: nothing relates a member of `limitMCSLindenbaum` back to the rational family beyond
the members already in `limitSetBelow m r`. Recorded for comparison with the ultrafilter limit
below, which is the extension consumers should use.

/-! ## Maximality by ultrafilter limit

The extension consumers should use. Its members are exactly the formulas whose membership set
`{q | A ∈ m q}` is "large" for a fixed ultrafilter refining the left-neighbourhood filter of
`r` (`limitFilterBelow`, defined above), so maximality is immediate from the ultrafilter
dichotomy while every member remains realised at rationals arbitrarily close below `r`.

This is what an arbitrary Lindenbaum extension cannot provide, and it is what lets a membership
at a real point be traced back to the rational family. The proof is the ultrafilter's
properness: the membership set and the interval `(z, r)` are both large, so they meet.
