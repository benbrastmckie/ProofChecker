# RealExtensionBundle: the real bundle over a rational bundle

`Bundle/RealExtension.lean` extends a single rational `FMCS` to an `ℝ`-indexed one by rational
selection. This module assembles those extensions into a `BFMCS (fc := fc) ℝ` over a
`BFMCS (fc := fc) Rat`, and proves the two modal coherence fields.

## Box time-stability

Both modal fields rest on one syntactic fact: within a single `FMCS`, membership of a boxed
formula does not depend on the time index (`box_stable_in_fmcs`). The forward-in-time direction
is `temporalFutureDerived` (`Theorems/Combinators.lean`, `□φ → G(□φ)`) fed to `forward_G`.

The backward-in-time direction does **not** use a `□φ → H(□φ)` principle. No such axiom exists
in this system — `ProofSystem/Axioms.lean`'s Layer 4 has exactly one modal-temporal axiom,
`modal_future` — and none is added here. Instead the *negation* is pushed forward: from
`¬□φ` at the earlier point, S5 negative introspection (`negBoxIntrospection` below, from
`Axiom.modal_5_collapse`) gives `□¬□φ`, `temporalFutureDerived` propagates it forward with
`forward_G`, and `Axiom.modal_t` recovers `¬□φ` at the later point, contradicting `□φ` there.
Only `forward_G` is ever used, in both directions.

S5 negative introspection is already proved at `FrameClass.Base` as `negBoxToBoxNegBox` in
`BXCanonical/Frame.lean`, but that module sits *above* `Bundle/` in the import graph, so the
`fc`-generic form is re-derived here rather than imported.

## The family set is closed under real shifts

`BFMCS.toRealBundle` takes as its family set the **real-shift closure**
`{fam.toRealShift δ | fam ∈ B.families, δ : ℝ}`, not the image of `B.families` under a single
extension. This is forced by `modal_backward`, and the reason is worth recording.

`modal_backward` at a real time `t` must, from `φ` holding in *every* real family at `t`,
recover `□φ`. Through `box_mem_realLimitMCS_iff` that reduces to `□φ ∈ fam.mcs q` for every
rational `q`, and the rational bundle's own `modal_backward` at `q` then demands a witness
family carrying `φ` **at the rational `q`**. Under the image family set the only available
real families are the unshifted extensions, whose value at `t` is a left limit whose "eventually"
threshold is a real number below `t`; distinct families supply distinct thresholds and, at an
unselected `t`, no single rational lies below all of them. The rational-side field is then
inapplicable. Under the real-shift closure the witness family is instead *positioned*: the
member `fam'.toRealShift ((q : ℝ) - t)` has value exactly `fam'.mcs q` at `t`, by
`realLimitMCS_of_rat`. This mirrors the rational construction in
`BXCanonical/Chronicle/ChronicleToCountermodelBasic.lean`, whose `modal_backward` likewise
positions its witness family by choosing the chronicle's rational shift.

/--
**S5 negative introspection**: `¬□φ → □(¬□φ)`, at an arbitrary frame class.

`Axiom.modal_5_collapse` is `◇□φ → □φ`, i.e. `¬□(¬□φ) → □φ`. Contraposing gives
`¬□φ → ¬¬□(¬□φ)`, and double negation elimination discharges the outer pair. The derivation is
built at `FrameClass.Base` and lifted, since `FrameClass.base_le` makes every frame class admit
it.

**Boxed membership in the real extension is case-free.** Given box time-stability of the
rational family, `□φ` lies in the extension at *some* real point exactly when it lies in *every*
rational set.

At a selected point this is stability alone. At an unselected point the forward direction is the
descent handle `limitMCSBelow_cofinal_below`: the ultrafilter limit realises `□φ` at some
rational below the point, and stability spreads it to all rationals. This is what makes both
modal fields of `BFMCS.toRealBundle` free of the selected/unselected case split.

The **real bundle** over a rational bundle: every real shift of every rational family, extended
to `ℝ` by rational selection.

The family set is the real-shift closure rather than an image; this module's docstring records
why `modal_backward` forces that choice. Both modal fields run through
`box_mem_realLimitMCS_iff`, so neither performs a selected/unselected case split.

/-! ## Restricted temporal coherence

The past half of `RestrictedTemporallyCoherent` transports unconditionally, because the
extension takes the limit **from below**: a `somePast` membership at an unselected point
descends to a rational `p` below the point (`limitMCSBelow_cofinal_below`), and the rational
witness supplied there is below `p`, hence below the point.

The future half does not, and the asymmetry is not an artifact of the proof. Its residual
obligation is isolated as `BFMCS.LimitFutureWitness` below.
-/

/--
**The residual future-witness obligation at unselected reals.**

Whenever `F φ` (for `φ` in the deferral closure) lies in the ultrafilter limit of a family at a
real point `r`, some rational **strictly above** `r` already carries `φ`.

*Why this is not derivable from `RestrictedTemporallyCoherent` alone.* Let `φ` be an atom, let
`r` be irrational, and let a rational family carry `φ` exactly at a strictly increasing sequence
of rationals converging to `r`, with `¬φ` at every rational above `r`.

- *Current behaviour.* Every rational `q < r` has a `φ`-point in `(q, r)`, so `F φ ∈ m q` is
  consistent with, and forced by nothing that contradicts, the family's `forward_G` and
  `backward_H` fields; the rational family can satisfy `RestrictedTemporallyCoherent` in full,
  since each `F φ ∈ m q` has its witness inside `(q, r)`. As `{q | F φ ∈ m q}` then contains
  every rational below `r`, it belongs to `limitFilterBelow r` and hence to the ultrafilter, so
  `F φ ∈ limitMCSBelow m r`.
- *Required behaviour.* A real point `s > r - δ` of the extension carries `φ` only if `s + δ` is
  the cast of a rational `u > r` with `φ ∈ m u` (selection), or `φ ∈ limitMCSBelow m (s + δ)`.
  The second is impossible too: `(z, s + δ)` for `z` between `r` and `s + δ` is a member of the
  ultrafilter at `s + δ` and is disjoint from `{u | φ ∈ m u}`.
- *Isolation.* Nothing above uses the extension's own fields; the obstruction is entirely a
  property of the rational family, namely that its `φ`-points accumulate at `r` from below and
  stop there. Ruling that out is what this predicate asks for, and it is the sole extra
  hypothesis of `BFMCS.toRealBundle_restricted_temporally_coherent`.

The selected points need nothing: there the extension *is* the rational family, and the rational
witness transports by a shift.

*Why the unselectedness hypothesis is forced, not cosmetic.* Quantifying over **all** reals `r`
makes the statement outright false. Take `r = (p : ℝ)` for a rational `p` at which the set
`S_φ = {q | φ ∈ m q}` attains a maximum. Every rational `q < p` then sees a `φ`-point in
`(q, p]`, so `F φ` can sit in the ultrafilter limit at `p`, while no rational **strictly above**
`p` carries `φ` at all. The hypothesis `¬ ∃ q : Rat, (q : ℝ) = r` removes exactly that
configuration, and it is what the sole consumer already has in scope: the future half of
`BFMCS.toRealBundle_restricted_temporally_coherent` invokes this predicate only inside the
`by_cases` branch where the shifted coordinate is unselected.

*Why the predicate is nevertheless discharged, and at what cost.* The obstruction described
above is precisely a **definable gap** for the formula `F φ`: below the gap `F φ` holds on an
initial interval `(-∞, sup S_φ)`, above it `F φ` fails everywhere, and no point realises the
transition. Prior's Until axiom in gap form, `Axiom.prior_U_gap` — `U(⊤,χ) ∧ F(¬χ) →
U(¬χ ∨ K⁺(¬χ), χ)` — excludes exactly such configurations (Reynolds 1992, printed p.168 for the
axiom; printed p.176 for the "no definable gaps" argument). Applying it at `χ := F φ` rather
than at `φ` is what makes the antecedent `U(⊤, χ)` free, since `χ`'s truth region below the gap
is an interval rather than an accumulating set. The discharge is therefore
**`fc`-conditional**: it needs `FrameClass.RTime ≤ fc`, and it is carried out in
`BXCanonical/Chronicle/ChronicleLimitGapWitness.lean` as `limitFutureWitness_of_priorU`.
The obligation itself is Burgess 1984's prophecy-at-a-gap claim, printed pp.109-110.

    Formula.someFuture φ ∈ limitMCSBelow fam.mcs r → ∃ s : Rat, r < (s : ℝ) ∧ φ ∈ fam.mcs s

/--
**The guard-reach obligation at unselected reals.**

Whenever a formula `ψ` holds at every rational of an interval `(r, c)` abutting an **unselected**
real `r` from above, `ψ` already lies in `limitSetBelow fam.mcs r` — that is, it holds throughout
some interval abutting `r` from below.

*The reading.* This says exactly that the `ψ`-region has no definable **right gap** at `r`, in
Reynolds' sense: `γ⁻(ψ)` would hold at a point whose `ψ`-stretch runs down to a gap below which
`¬ψ` is arbitrarily recently true (Reynolds 1992, printed p.175). Prior's Since axiom in gap form,
`Axiom.prior_S_gap` — `S(⊤,ψ) ∧ P(¬ψ) → S(¬ψ ∨ K⁻(¬ψ), ψ)` — excludes precisely that
configuration. Applying it to the **guard** `ψ` rather than to a witness is what makes the
antecedent `S(⊤, ψ)` free: the hypothesis of this predicate supplies `ψ` uninterruptedly on a whole
interval abutting `r`. The discharge is therefore **`fc`-conditional**, requiring
`FrameClass.RTime ≤ fc`, and is carried out in
`BXCanonical/Chronicle/ChronicleLimitGuardWitness.lean` as `limitGuardBelow_of_priorS`.

*Why there is no closure hypothesis, and no `root` argument.* Its sibling `LimitFutureWitness`
carries `φ ∈ deferralClosure root`, and its chronicle discharge discards that argument. Mirroring
it here would be worse than redundant — it would be **actively wrong**. The consumers of this
predicate apply it to the *guard* `ψ` of an `untl ψ φ ∈ subformulaClosure root`, and such a guard
need not lie in `deferralClosure root`; the mirrored hypothesis would be an unprovable side
condition at every call site. The asymmetry with `LimitFutureWitness` is deliberate and is not to
be "fixed". With no closure hypothesis there is nothing for a `root` parameter to constrain, so
the predicate takes none.

    r < (c : ℝ) → (∀ q : Rat, r < (q : ℝ) → (q : ℝ) < (c : ℝ) → ψ ∈ fam.mcs q) →
    ψ ∈ limitSetBelow fam.mcs r

/--
**The guard-eventuality obligation at unselected reals.**

Whenever an `untl` or an `snce` formula survives into the ultrafilter limit at an **unselected**
real `r`, its guard `ψ` is not merely cofinally but *eventually* true below `r`: it lies in
`limitSetBelow fam.mcs r`, i.e. it holds at every rational of some interval abutting `r` from
below.

*The reading.* This is exactly the failure of Reynolds' `γ⁺` at the guard. Reynolds defines the
connective by saying that "`γ⁺(A)` holds exactly when `A` remains true for a while after now but
only up until a gap after which `A` is arbitrarily soon false", and calls the indicated gap an
`A` **left gap** (Reynolds 1992, printed p.175). The predicate here says the guard `ψ` of a
surviving `untl`/`snce` has no *accumulating* left approach at `r` — its truth region abuts `r`
from below as an interval rather than as a merely cofinal set.

*Why this is the whole residual, and why it is necessary as well as sufficient.* Sufficiency:
together with the guard-reach lemma above a gap it discharges both unselected forward cases (see
`toRealBundle_forward_until_unselected` and `toRealBundle_forward_since_unselected`). Necessity:
the forward `untl` obligation's own conclusion quantifies the guard over **all** reals of an
interval `(t, s)`, whose selected members are precisely the rationals of `(t + δ, s + δ)`; feeding
that rational guard interval back through `BFMCS.LimitGuardBelow` returns exactly this predicate's
conclusion. So the obligation entails the predicate, and there is no weaker sufficient condition to
look for.

*Why there is no closure hypothesis, and no `root` argument.* For the identical reason recorded for
`BFMCS.LimitGuardBelow`: the consumers apply this predicate to the *guard* `ψ` of an
`untl ψ φ ∈ subformulaClosure root`, and such a guard need not lie in `deferralClosure root`, so a
mirrored closure hypothesis would be an unprovable side condition at every call site. With no
closure hypothesis there is nothing for a `root` parameter to constrain, so the predicate takes
none.

*Discharge.* Unlike `BFMCS.LimitFutureWitness` and `BFMCS.LimitGuardBelow`, this predicate is **not**
discharged from a Dedekind axiom: `Axiom.prior_U_gap`'s antecedent `U(⊤, χ)` *is* the below-gap
interval it would have to produce, `Axiom.prior_S_gap` consumes an above-gap interval and so yields
only the necessity direction, and `Axiom.sep` lives entirely inside `K⁺`/`K⁻`. Its discharge is
therefore deferred, and it has no source in the corpus — Reynolds reaches ℝ by the separability
route instead (printed pp.177-178), and Burgess 1984 runs the completion argument only in the
`F`/`G` fragment, where the gap witness is placed on the far side with no bound whatever and no
guard to carry (printed pp.109-110).

**Transport of restricted temporal coherence to the real bundle.**

Both halves split on selection of the shifted coordinate. At a selected point the rational
witness `s` transports to the real point `(s : ℝ) - δ`, whose own shifted coordinate is `s`,
so `realLimitMCS_of_rat` reads the value off directly. At an unselected point the past half uses
the descent handle `limitMCSBelow_cofinal_below` and the future half consumes
`BFMCS.LimitFutureWitness`; see that predicate's docstring for why the future half needs it.
