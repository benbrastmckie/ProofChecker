# Bundle Completeness for TM Bimodal Logic

This directory implements the **Bundle of Maximal Consistent Sets (BFMCS)** approach for
proving completeness of TM bimodal logic. This is a Henkin-style completeness proof that
resolves the modal completeness obstruction present in traditional canonical model approaches.

## Reflexive G/H Semantics

Under reflexive semantics, G and H quantify over `s >= t` and `s <= t` respectively
(including the current time). The canonical accessibility relation is a **reflexive
transitive preorder**.

### Reflexive Semantics Without Added Axioms

- All BFMCS completeness infrastructure is `SORRY-FREE (sorryAx-free; axioms: exactly propext,
  Classical.choice, Quot.sound)` — never "axiom-free", which would misdescribe the three
  Lean-level axioms every result here depends on
- The whole directory is proven without adding any frame axiom
- `canonicalR_reflexive` proven via T-axiom (reflexive preorder)
- Per-construction strictness pattern for local irreflexivity proofs
- Removed inconsistent `existsTask_irreflexive_axiom`

## Key Insight

Completeness is an **existential** statement:

> If Gamma is consistent, then there EXISTS a model satisfying Gamma.

The BFMCS approach constructs exactly ONE such satisfying model by:
1. Bundling together related maximal consistent sets (MCSes)
2. Restricting box quantification to families within the bundle
3. Using modal coherence conditions to ensure the truth lemma is provable

**This is NOT a weakening of completeness.** It is analogous to:
- Henkin semantics for higher-order logic
- Standard practice in mathematical logic

The completeness theorem states that derivability and BFMCS-validity coincide. Combined with
soundness (derivability implies standard-validity), we get a full characterization.

## Temporal Duality Discipline

**The rule**: when a past statement is the `Formula.swapTemporal` image of a future one, prove
the future form and obtain the past form by `Formula.swapTemporal` +
`DerivationTree.temporal_duality` + `Formula.swap_temporal_involution`; do not write the mirror
by hand. `Algebraic/FlowFrame.lean`'s `past_tf_deriv` is the reference implementation: it proves
a future-side syntactic theorem generically in its argument formula, applies it at the *swapped*
argument, dualizes the whole derivation with `DerivationTree.temporal_duality`, then uses
`swap_temporal_involution` (plus the `swap_temporal_*` simp set) to fold the double-swap back to
the original formula.

**Worked example**: `WitnessSeed.lean`'s `allFuture_bot_imp_neg_deriv` /
`allPast_bot_imp_neg_deriv` pair applies the rule directly. The future-side lemma is a closed
`DerivationTree fc [] (...)` fact (`⊢ G(⊥) → G(¬chi)`, built from `prop_s` + temporal
necessitation + temporal K distribution + modus ponens); its past dual follows `past_tf_deriv`'s
pattern verbatim and is wired into the shared witness-seed core
(`allFuture_neg_of_gseed_inconsistent` / `allPast_neg_of_hseed_inconsistent`) in place of a
second hand derivation through `pastNecessitation`/`pastKDist`.

**The boundary the technique does not cross**: the rule applies to *closed* syntactic facts
(`⊢[fc] φ`, no free context) — a `Formula.swapTemporal`-image of a provable formula is provable,
full stop. It does **not** apply directly to a statement relative to a fixed, arbitrary MCS `M`
(or a fixed `FMCS` family), because swapping the *formula* without also transporting `M` itself
(via `Formula.swapTemporal '' M`, together with a proof that the image of an MCS is again an MCS)
proves a fact about a *different* set, not about `M`. Four mirror pairs surveyed during this
discipline's rollout — `TemporalContent.lean`'s `f_content_iff_not_neg_in_g_content` /
`p_content_iff_not_neg_in_h_content`, `TemporalCoherence.lean`'s
`restricted_temporal_backward_{G,H}[_strict]`, and `WitnessSeed.lean`'s two `_absurd` /
`_to_all_*_neg` helper pairs — all fall on this side of the boundary: each direction already
calls its own pre-existing, independently-defined primitive (`someFuture_mono`/`somePast_mono`,
`dneTheorem`), so there is no isolable closed syntactic step left to dualize, and building the
general MCS-image-transport machinery to cross the boundary was judged disproportionate to the
size of these four pairs. See the implementation plan's Phase 5 Reasoned Exclusions table for the
full per-pair evidence.

**Order-theoretic mirrors are a separate case, handled separately**: where the "mirror" is a
`<`/`>` order reversal rather than a `swapTemporal` image — the `limitSet`/`limitMCS` family in
`LimitMCS.lean` — this discipline does not apply at all. That duplication is closed by the
`TemporalSide` parameter introduced in Group C (`LimitMCS.lean`, `LimitMCSCoherence.lean`), not
by `swapTemporal`.

The canonical-frame half of this directory -- `CanonicalFrame.lean`,
`CanonicalTaskRelation.lean`, `SuccRelation.lean`, `Construction.lean`,
`UntilSinceCoherence.lean` and `ModalSaturation.lean` -- was retired to
[`Boneyard/BundleDeadHalf/`](../../Boneyard/BundleDeadHalf/README.md), whose README records what
each was and why it died. Nothing in the live tree imported them once the `Core -> Bundle`
directory import cycle was broken. Their pure-syntax and derivation-tree content did not go with
them: the iterated-`F`/`P` machinery is now
`Syntax/SubformulaClosure/IteratedTemporal.lean`, and the object-level modal theorems are
`Theorems/ModalDerived.lean`.

## Main Theorems

| Theorem | Type | Status | File |
|---------|------|--------|------|
| `BFMCS.reflexivity` / `BFMCS.transitivity` | S5 modal coherence of the bundle | **SORRY-FREE** | BFMCS.lean |
| `BFMCS.CanonicalCoherence` | Bundles the three restricted coherence hypotheses the truth lemma needs | **SORRY-FREE** | TemporalCoherence.lean |
| `restricted_temporal_backward_G` / `restricted_temporal_backward_H` (and `_strict` variants) | Backward temporal coherence for the truth lemma | **SORRY-FREE** | TemporalCoherence.lean |
| `allFuture_neg_of_gseed_inconsistent` / `allPast_neg_of_hseed_inconsistent` | Shared witness-seed consistency core (future/past) | **SORRY-FREE** | WitnessSeed.lean |
| `BFMCS.toRealBundle_restricted_temporally_coherent` | Transport of restricted coherence to the real bundle | **SORRY-FREE** | RealExtensionBundle.lean |

### Sorry Status

**Active sorries in `Bundle/`**: **0**, without qualification. The structural sorry inventory is
zero across all of `FormalSystem/` (`Boneyard/` excluded); check C3 of
`scripts/check-module-invariants.sh` asserts this directory-wide and unconditionally.

**Key Achievement**: The BFMCS construction provides a complete, verified path from
consistent formula to satisfying model.

## Why BFMCS Works

### The Box Case Problem

Traditional completeness proofs fail at the box case because:

```
Standard semantics: Box phi true iff phi true at ALL accessible worlds
MCS membership:     Can only witness phi at bundled/constructed families
```

The quantification over "all worlds" cannot be matched by MCS membership.

### The BFMCS Solution

BFMCS restricts box quantification to bundled families:

```lean
def bmcs_truth_at (B : BFMCS D) (fam : FMCS D) (t : D) : Formula -> Prop
  | Formula.box phi => forall fam' in B.families, bmcs_truth_at B fam' t phi
  ...
```

With modal coherence conditions:
- `modal_forward`: Box phi in MCS implies phi in ALL bundled families
- `modal_backward`: phi in ALL bundled families implies Box phi in MCS

The truth lemma box case becomes:

```
Forward: Box phi in fam.mcs t
  -> by modal_forward: phi in fam'.mcs t for all fam' in B.families
  -> by IH: bmcs_truth_at B fam' t phi for all fam' in B.families
  -> bmcs_truth_at B fam t (Box phi)

Backward: bmcs_truth_at B fam t (Box phi)
  = forall fam' in B.families, bmcs_truth_at B fam' t phi
  -> by IH: phi in fam'.mcs t for all fam' in B.families
  -> by modal_backward: Box phi in fam.mcs t
```

Both directions are provable!

## Relationship to Standard Semantics

BFMCS completeness + standard soundness gives the full picture:

```
Derivability <-> BFMCS-validity -> Standard-validity

               |-- BFMCS completeness --|   |-- soundness --|
```

- **BFMCS completeness**: `deriv phi <-> bmcs_valid phi` (this module)
- **Standard soundness**: `deriv phi -> standard_valid phi` (Metalogic/Soundness.lean)

Any derivable formula is valid in all models (standard or BFMCS).

## Future Work

1. **Consolidate the derived object-level theorems**: `Theorems/ModalDerived.lean` now holds
   the DNE, S5-introspection and `connect_past` helpers this directory used to declare inline
2. **Multi-family saturation**: Generalize singleFamilyBFMCS to full multi-family construction
3. **Compactness via BFMCS**: Potentially restore infinitary strong completeness using BFMCS
