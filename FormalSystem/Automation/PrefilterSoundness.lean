# PrefilterSoundness: Soundness Proofs for Invalid Pattern Recognizers

This module provides formal soundness proofs for each invalid-pattern recognizer
function defined in `DatasetGenerator.lean`. These proofs establish
that the structural invalid prefilter is sound: if it labels a formula as invalid,
then the formula is indeed not valid in the TM logic.

## Main Results

- `isUnsatBotTemporal_not_truth`: If `isUnsatBotTemporal φ = true`, then `φ` is false
  at every world/time whose evaluation history is total.
- `unfulfillable_until_not_truth`: If `G(¬event)` holds at time t, then
  `U(event, guard)` is false at time t.
- `unfulfillable_since_not_truth`: If `H(¬event)` holds at time t, then
  `S(event, guard)` is false at time t.

## Design Notes

The soundness proofs focus on the semantic level: they show that the detected
patterns correspond to formulas that evaluate to False at specific model points.
Combined with the observation that non-trivially-false antecedents admit models
where they are true, this establishes invalidity (the negation of universal
validity).

The `box` case in `isUnsatBotTemporal` requires `τ.IsTotal` so that the box
quantifier — which under `def:BL-semantics` ranges over the total histories
`H_F` — is instantiable at the evaluation history itself. This is automatically
satisfied in the validity definition, where `τ.IsTotal` is a premise.

No declaration in this module quantifies over an admissible-history set, and none
carries a shift-closure side condition: under the totality box clause there is no
such side condition to carry. `TruthAt` takes no set argument, so the call shape
here is exactly `valid`'s own.

## Core Lemma: isUnsatBotTemporal implies falsity

The key soundness lemma: any formula recognized as "always false" by
`isUnsatBotTemporal` is indeed false at every evaluation point, provided
the evaluation history is total (needed for the box case).
-/

/--
If `isUnsatBotTemporal φ = true`, then `φ` evaluates to `False` at every
model point `(M, τ, t)` where `τ` is total.

This is the core soundness lemma for the invalid prefilter. It establishes
that `isUnsatBotTemporal` is a sound "always false" recognizer.

Proof by structural induction on `φ`:
- `bot`: `TruthAt` for `bot` is `False` by definition.
- `untl guard event`: If `isUnsatBotTemporal event = true`, then by IH,
  `event` is false at all times. But `U(event, guard)` requires `∃ s > t,
  TruthAt ... s event`, which is impossible.
- `snce guard event`: Symmetric to Until.
- `box a`: If `isUnsatBotTemporal a = true`, then by IH, `a` is false
  at every model point whose history is total. Since `τ` is total
  and `box(a)` requires `∀ σ, σ.IsTotal → TruthAt ... σ t a`, choosing
  `σ = τ` gives `TruthAt ... τ t a`, which contradicts the IH.

## Unfulfillable Eventuality Lemma

If `G(¬event)` holds at time t (event is never true in the future), then
`U(event, guard)` is false at time t. This establishes soundness of
`hasUnfulfillableEventuality` for the Until case.
-/

/--
If `G(¬event)` holds at time t, then `U(event, guard)` is false at time t.

`G(¬event) = (¬event).allFuture` means `∀ s > t, ¬event(s)`.
`U(event, guard)` requires `∃ s > t, event(s)`. These are contradictory.

If `H(¬event)` holds at time t, then `S(event, guard)` is false at time t.
Symmetric past version of `unfulfillable_until_not_truth`.

`H(¬event) = (¬event).allPast` means `∀ s < t, ¬event(s)`.
`S(event, guard)` requires `∃ s < t, event(s)`. These are contradictory.

## False Consequent Invalidity

If the consequent of an implication is always false, the implication fails
at any model point where the antecedent is true. This is the semantic
foundation for the `invalid_false_consequent` pattern.
-/

/--
If `φ` is always false (at points where `τ` is total), then `antecedent → φ`
is false at any point where `antecedent` is true.

This is immediate: `antecedent → φ` evaluated as `TruthAt ... antecedent →
TruthAt ... φ`, so if `antecedent` is true and `φ` is false, the implication
is false.
